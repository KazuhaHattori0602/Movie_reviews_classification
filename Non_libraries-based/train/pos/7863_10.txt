this movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars  it tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to  plus the bomb blast scene is very real   what you read and are taught just does not happen   can raise your bp level by    all actors played their role very well   some scenes may   could have been avoided to include teenagers   this movie is quite adult in nature   not a movie that can be seen with family   casting is great
