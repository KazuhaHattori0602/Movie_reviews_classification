in my honest opinion  everyone should see this movie at least once  it really put things in perspective as i watched it  though it was fictional  this movie is about something that could happen to your children   it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school  and their plans to murder innocent students  this film would not have worked in any other format  they pulled off the hand held camera  perfectly   it reminds us of april  th    when eric harris  and dylan klebold murdered   students and then themselves  it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after  everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes   this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true  we get to see the kid behind the monster   the only bad thing about this movie  is that it did not do well on the market  and few people even know it existed  if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie  everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about  zero day   i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it  the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film  because it mostly focuses on cal and andre  and what they did up to that point   if you have not yet seen this movie  go rent it  and watch it  i guarantee that when it is finished  you will be speechless
