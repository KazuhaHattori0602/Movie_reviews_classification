well  the movie isn t exactly  funny   okay  i admit  there are a few humorous lines  but definitely nothing that is laugh out loud funny  for example  right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars  sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt  before leaving the room to retrieve the key  he tells her   okay  don t go anywhere   see  humorous  but not funny   the plot and acting are pretty good   but erika eleniak definitely steals the show  she s hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can t help but rewind and re watch   there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines   overall    stars  i d only give it three if not for erika eleniak
