strangler of the swamp was made by low budget studio prc and is certainly one of their best movies i ve seen   a man who was hanged for a murder he didn t commit returns as a ghost for revenge on the people who accused him  he uses a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths  including the old man who operates the ferry across the swamp  he disappears  the old man s granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and also falls in love with one of the local men and they decide to get married   this movie has plenty of foggy atmospheres  which makes it very creepy too   the cast includes rosemary la planche  blake edwards and charles middleton  flash gordon  as the strangler   strangler of the swamp is a must for old horror fans like myself  excellent   rating    and a half stars out of
