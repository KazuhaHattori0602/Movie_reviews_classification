the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot  my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the  s was noted for  how wrong i was  big studio  big budget and big production values make this a strong contender  at least visually  for the best sci fi film coming out of the era  i qualify with the word visually  because  war of the worlds  is a lot darker and scarier than  forbidden planet  and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory   what impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography  followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr  morbius   walter pidgeon  home and laboratory  but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake  the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold  it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say  that of  star wars  which made me consider  audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in   with sw  or in   with  aliens  watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect  and i m fairly resistant to hyperbole   it s not too much of a stretch to imagine  forbidden planet  as a direct antecedent of the  star trek  tv series  gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show  followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in  star trek  i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c v headed for a transporter room  while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st series   where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of  monsters from the id  that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for   when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures  the film worked it s subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams  leslie nielsen  explained it   you know  looking at the calendar  the year   isn t that far off  this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets  i think though  that they ll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby
