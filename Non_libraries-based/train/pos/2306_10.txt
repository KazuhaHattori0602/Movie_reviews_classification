had never heard of the man in the moon until seeing it last evening on this hdtv channel  look  my taste is like any others  eclectic  my favorites run from blue velvet to dr  strangelove to the ghost and mrs  muir thru the wizard of oz and the loved one  eraserhead  repo man  and the spy within   the man in the moon is superbly made  a gentle hearted  joyous and tragic film  beautifully filmed  one in which the actors truly live in the moment rather than act  this sweet tale shortly will be in our private library  this beautiful story of life in a far finer era in rural louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral setting   it s hard to remain stoic during the film s last moments  particularly when the young girl the extent of her older sister s heart searing private pain and forgives all   rather than spoil the enjoyment or bore you to sobs with my dull prose  will end now with this suggestion from one who enjoys films which speak from the heart to ours   if you purchase no other film  please  purchase the man in the moon  this moving story is one you ll enjoy reliving time and again  it is a joy and a gem  a film all too scarce in this world of hardening hearts   the simple virtues evinced in man in the moon are a joy to behold   paul vincent zecchino  manasota key  florida    april
