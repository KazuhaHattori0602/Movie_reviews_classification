i m surprised how many people give this move less than   stars   but they just don t understand the movie   the story is about growing up in a difficult situation   there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren   and there s good reason why so many critics like this movie   and the reason is because they understand the movie   i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people   i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write   lines   i frankly don t have anything else to say
