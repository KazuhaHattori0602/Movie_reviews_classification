this is not a love song   my one word summary of this film would be `excellent   it probably won t appeal to the mass movie watching public   it s a  film that forces you to participate  you observe  think  and question   comparisons could be made with deliverance  topic theme  and  perhaps with the blair witch project for overall filming style   however this film stands unique against both   the cinematography effects  solarisation  freeze frame  blur etc   have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this  film to underpin the natural tension of the story   acting is raw  menacing and utterly believable   the real theme of the film is about friendship  the title really gives  the game away  it s probably not the kind of friendship that most of  us have experienced or indeed would want to   it is a love song
