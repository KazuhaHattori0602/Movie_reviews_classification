this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge  i found the first   minutes a bit slow  but after that  the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living    some of the scenes are very funny  i don t think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie    some of the dresses are really beautiful  pity the movie is in black and white   i can only imagine what they would look like in color  the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious  there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that    watch it as soon as you can  and tell your friends about it
