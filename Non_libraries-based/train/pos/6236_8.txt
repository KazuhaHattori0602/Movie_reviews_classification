the plot intellect is about as light as feather down  but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic refusal we have become accustomed to in  the gay divorcee  and  top hat  is now absent  instead of the typical accidental acquaintance  the dancing duo are the former lovers bake baker and sherry martin  who are still in love since their dancing days   of course  being a  s musical  there s the problems of misunderstood romance  classy courtship and the slight irritation of a sabotaged audition with bicarbonate soda has costing ginger something rather special  and then in the grand tradition of dwindling finances  there s nothing better for hollywood s best entertainers than put on a show   delightful numbers from irving berlin are sprinkled throughout the show  top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end  which remains a refreshing change  fred and ginger are out again to charm the world and charm the navy  everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable   pure classic silliness at its best  but with astaire and rogers  we just know it s got to work   rating
