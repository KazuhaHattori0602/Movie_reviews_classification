ya  that is what i think  sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without   i love having c j  and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together   when john was still around i really didn t laugh as much as i do now   it is too bad that no more are being made    i don t think  because i would love to see some new material   my favorite character must be rory  poor rory is almost always left out  it is always about bridget or carrie  what about rory  honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it  i almost guarantee you will laugh  well even chuckle
