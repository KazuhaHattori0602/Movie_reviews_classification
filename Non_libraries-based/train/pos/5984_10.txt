this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context   it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies  and the  s saw plenty of them  i saw this movie when it first came out  and instantly liked it  being a big fan of kiss  it was great to see gene in the movie  and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can t be all bad  also  fastway was already a favorite of mine  so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack   the original vhs  this was pre dvd  cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling  playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a  demon  looking on  it was a special order  and the price for the vhs copy at the time  circa   was   i really wanted the movie  but not at that ridiculous price  the  ozzy gene  cover was only created for the   re release  the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie  so they had better put  em on the cover  same thing with the original  little shop of horrors    jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes  but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star   i have a  trick or treat  web site  and it s surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person  fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to  sammi curr   all in all  it was just a good time  rock n roll movie  definitely not to be taken too seriously  but just enjoyed
