like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons  this movie has humor at different levels  i just introduced this to my   year old daughter and   year old son  both enjoyed the movie   busting out laughing quite a few times  and my daughter is not much of a sci fi fan  the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times  the adult level humor  that is  humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences  no baudy or r rated stuff to be found here  keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults  for example of the adult level humor  the martian voices are based on characters of different movies actors  the martian pilot  blaznee  has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson  the scientist  that of peter seller s dr  strangelove  the special effects are surprisingly good for this film  the lack of top   actors actually works in the movie s favor  and the actors actresses play their part well   in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles  needs over box office draw power  an excellent example is wayne alexander s  vern  character  i had to write this review  the kids are playing this for the  rd time in   days over dinner right now  good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there s nothing on and i m bored movie
