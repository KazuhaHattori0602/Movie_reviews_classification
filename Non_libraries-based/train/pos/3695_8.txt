i was lucky enough to attend a screening in stockholm for this elegantly expressed  enjoyable  and thought provoking film  with romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal  paris je t aime boldly plunges into love in paris  navigating the different forms in eighteen separate  quartiers  but without pouting parisiennes and saccharine formulas  its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors  parts   frustration over only having   minutes of screen time   thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party   debating whether or not i should review all   segments  i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long winded  instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills  and certainly you ll find your favourite  although gus van sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective  his les marais is one of the better contributions  even sneaking in a well placed kurt cobain reference  the coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris  a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve buscemi  deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre  and perhaps rightly so    in this way  all story lines are exquisitely unique   filtered through the minds of different directors   but the one that deviates the most from the rest is vincenzo natali s quartier de la madeleine  a dark horror gothic love starring elijah wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of paris in the night who meets a vampiress  with a black and white format but blood red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen  it nearly becomes a pastiche of sin city   a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film    yet my single favourite segment was faubourg saint denis by tom tykwer but i think i was conditioned to think so  given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying  finally  that s my favourite director here  nevertheless  it cannot be denied that tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone  and hears from his girlfriend  portman   for once not annoying  that she breaks up with him  and he reflects on their relationship  as is tywker s style  the story is dizzyingly fast paced  kinetic and repetitive  featuring screaming and running  lola rennt  making it the most adrenaline pumping segment in paris je t aime and possibly also the most touching once tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool   music   to fill the negative account  clearly not all directors manage as touching as tywker  van sant  cohens  coixet and d pardieu  sylvain chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met  they are two lonely mimes  this part is so in your face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers  suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard looking juliette binoche whom mourns the loss of her son  nothing else happens  finally  the wrap up and interweaving of the   stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half hearted   yet paris je t aime truly spoils you with quality  for all the other stories are well crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing  it is certainly one of the highlights of    not saying much  i suppose  and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite  highly recommended both to mainstream of  pretentious   heh  audiences     out
