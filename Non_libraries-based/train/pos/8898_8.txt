the  s is a great movie i saw it completely in one night  about the hippy movement in the late  s  although the title would suggest otherwise the first   years of the  s are not really important in this film   the main character of the movie is michael a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam war  there he meets his girlfriend sarah michael s brother brian goes to vietnam to fight what a surprise he comes back from the war and changes in a  tom cruise born on the fourth of july  look a like and then into a hippy his dad is a pro vietnam war type of guy what a surprise michael s sister kate gets pregnant from a rock   roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love  the ending is very poor father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy but i let this slip away from my vote the rest of the movie is very good    the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant  all the main events of the sixties are in the movie like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests the summer of love and woodstock  look closely for wavy woodstock speaker gravy what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for   as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival   in the end the  s is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade
