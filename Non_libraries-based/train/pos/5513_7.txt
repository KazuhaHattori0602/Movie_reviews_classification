from what i ve read a lot of people were disappointed by this film  compared to part   initially i could understand this but after a bit of thought i think they are wrong to be  soderbergh continues his fact based telling of che s life that he started in part   part   told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion  part   tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion  it is not soderbergh s fault that these   parts of che s life had completely different outcomes  he bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way  the viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after part   than part   but that is the reality of che s life and not in my opinion any fault of the director  the film is far from perfect  it is probably too long  at least in part   we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes  in part   they can t catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture  che s capture and death are dealt with well  the film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in spanish  benicio del toro is again excellent as the charismatic argentinian  so if you ve seen part   you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in part
