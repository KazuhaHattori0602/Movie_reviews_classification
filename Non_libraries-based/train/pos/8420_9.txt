  and hollywood had been on the map as the centre of the cinematic world for a little over a decade  now that it had become the site of a multi million dollar industry and the vertically integrated studio system had been established  some of those in the calmer quarters of this film making factory were taking the time for a little self reflection  the last command  while its heart may be the classic story of a once prestigious man fallen on hard times  frames that tale within a bleak look at how cinema unceremoniously recreates reality  and how its production process could be mercilessly impersonal  it was written by lajos biro  who had been on the scene long enough to know   taking centre stage is a man who was at the time among hollywood s most celebrated immigrants   emil jannings  before coming to the states jannings had worked mainly in comedy  being a master of the hammy yet hilariously well timed performance  often as pompous authority figures or doddering old has beens  he makes his entrance in the last command as the latter  and at first it looks as if this is to be another of jannings s scenery chomping caricatures  however  as the story progresses the actor gets to demonstrate his range  showing by turns delicate frailty  serene dignity and eventually awesome power and presence in the finale  he never quite stops being a blustering exaggeration  the german acting tradition knowing nothing of subtlety  but he constantly holds our attention with absolute control over every facet of his performance   the director was another immigrant  albeit one who had been around hollywood a bit longer and had no background in the european film industry  nevertheless joseph von sternberg cultivated for himself the image of the artistic and imperious teutonic kino meister  the  von  was made up  by the way  and took a very distinctive approach to the craft  of note in this picture is his handling of pace and tone  a great example being the first of the russian flashback scenes  we open with a carefully constructed chaos with movement in converging directions  which we the audience become part of as the camera pulls back and extras dash across the screen  then  when jannings arrives  everything settles down  jannings s performance is incredibly sedate and measured  and when the players around him begin to mirror this the effect is as if his mere presence has restored order   sternberg appears to show a distaste for violence  allowing the grimmest moments to take place off screen  and yet implying that they have happened with a flow of images that is almost poetic  in fact  he really seems to have an all round lack of interest in action  in the scene of the prisoners  revolt sternberg takes an aloof and objective stance  his camera eventually retreating to a fly on the wall position  compare this to the following scenes between jannings and evelyn brent  which are a complex medley of point of view shots and intense close ups  thrusting us right into the midst of their interaction   as a personality on set  it would seem that sternberg was much like the cold and callous director played on the screen by william powell  and in fact powell s portrayal is probably something of a deliberate parody that even sternberg himself would have been in on  unfortunately this harsh attitude did not make him an easy man to work with  and coupled with his focus on his technical resources over his human ones  the smaller performances in his pictures leave a little to be desired  while jannings displays classic hamming in the charles laughton mode that works dramatically  it appears no one told his co stars they were not in a comedy  evelyn brent is fairly good  giving us some good emoting  but overplaying it here and there  the only performance that comes close to jannings is that of powell himself  it s a little odd to see the normally amiable star of the thin man and the great ziegfeld playing a figure so stern and humourless  like a male ninotchka  but he does a good job  revealing a smouldering emotional intensity beneath the hard hearted exterior   the last command could easily have ruffled a few feathers in studio offices  as tends to happen with any disparaging commentary on the film making process  even a relatively tame example like this  at the very least  i believe many studio heads would have been displeased by the  behind the scenes  view  as it threatened the mystique of movie making which was still very much alive at this point  as it turned out  such was the impact of the picture that jannings won the first ever academy award for best actor  as well as a best writing nomination for lajos biro and  according to some sources  although the issue is a little vague  a nomination for best picture  this is significant  since the academy was a tiny institution at this time and the first awards were more than ever a bit of self indulgent back slapping by the hollywood elite  but elite or not  they recognised good material when they saw it  and were willing to reward it
