ice age is not only animation of the year  in my eyes  it s also the best animated feature i ve ever seen   the teaser excited me last year and i ve spent many happy hours on the website  scrat is cool  and so are the rest of the sub zero heroes   the animation is superb  your heart really goes out to the characters in this film  they have good lines of dialogue and are well developed  it s hard to say which one really steals the picture   i experienced their journey with laughter  tears and amazement  nothing was forced or over done  the emotion was genuine  especially in the dramatic second half  the last film to affect me this deeply was anastasia in   also a fox production  and before that it was the land before time   all possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience  not just the cynics
