this movie of   minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies  it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war  it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations  told at list   years after those events toke place  around   bc   this is a   movie  so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian  even the close caption is in italian  pity  many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles  but if this is not a problem for you  than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie
