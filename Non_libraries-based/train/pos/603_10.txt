the music of albeniz pervades this film  once and a while it is played with original instrumentation  e g  piano  but never full orchestra  but often it is re worked with various contemporary ensembles  e g guitar  and treatments  e g  jazz piano  only occasionally is the music the sole focus of the film  the vast majority of the time the music is set to various dances  often flamenco  but not always  i would guess that there are   scenes  which are not united by a plot  not all scenes will reach the heights for an individual viewer  in my case about half reached the pinnacle  though all the rest were in their own way very fine  those that worked for me moved me to goose flesh aesthetic delight  indeed  the final scene left me weepy with joy  and in some very magical way it brings you deep into spanish culture  if you don t like subtitles  don t worry  the film is virtually wordless  though each scene carries a title of an albeniz piece  seeing this very beautiful film sharpens my complaint that virtually none of the films of saura are available on dvd in the usa  i am thinking here particularly of his flamenco version of  carmen  a spectacular work of art that is available in europe but not here  european dvd s won t play on american dvd players  this is a scandal
