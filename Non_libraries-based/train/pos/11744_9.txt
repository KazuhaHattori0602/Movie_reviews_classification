 mr  harvey lights a candle  is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spall   while we can predict that his titular morose  up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past  how his emotions are unveiled is surprising  spall s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertory   while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes  such as on  the simpsons  this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brook s script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes  and is almost formally divided into acts   we re introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids  with their uniforms i couldn t tell if this is a  private  or  public  school  as they gather   the rapping black kids  the serious south asians and muslims  the white bullies and mean girls   but conveyed quite naturally and individually  the young actors  some of whom i recognized from british tv such as  shameless  were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures  celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor s role than the martinets she usually has to play   a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious  we think  like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of  coupling  that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance  but it s much more about faith in people as well as god  which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the u s  over christmas   nathalie press  who was also so good in  summer of love  has a key role in mr  harvey s redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching  but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way  unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials   while it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip  a pilgrimage  this quiet film was the best evocation of  good will towards men  than i ve seen in most holiday themed tv movies
