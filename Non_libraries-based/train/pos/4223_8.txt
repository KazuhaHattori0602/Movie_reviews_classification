the movie has a great written genre story  it features all of the usual columbo ingredients  the way lt  columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect  the way the mystery unravels for him  columbo s dog  the cat and mouse play  which is great in this one and luckily as well some good relieving humor  mostly involving the columbo character  it s all written despite the fact that it doesn t even have a truly original concept  columbo hunting down a detective murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movie   it s also an extremely well directed movie from james frawley  who after this directed   more columbo movies  in the  s and  s  he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences   it s one of the slower moving columbo movies  despite not having a too long running time  this style and approach doesn t always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does  which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie   most columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film making  as the movie its murderer  this movie stars the rather unknown   year old ruth gordon  she didn t starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some  mostly for her role in  rosemary s baby  which also won her an oscar  she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting  which some people might not like though  it earned her   more oscar nominations throughout her career  prior to her win for  rosemary s baby  in   she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences together   the movie also stars a still young g d  spradlin  i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career  despite the fact that he already was   at the time of this columbo production  he is still alive but retired from acting  ever since    an even better than usual columbo movie entry
