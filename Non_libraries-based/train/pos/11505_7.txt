a couple of years back i had purchased  and enjoyed  the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies  the night stalker   and the night strangler   when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out  i had intended to buy it immediately   but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd s kept me from adding it to my collection  recently  i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak  discer as well   having watched it now  i can safely say that i didn t regret acquiring this beloved  if short lived  crime horror series one bit  it may follow a standardized formula   dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak  marvelously played by darren mcgavin  gets into everybody s hair with his attitude  flustered editor simon oakland  long suffering colleagues  assorted authoritarian figures  a plethora of monsters and villains  faces up to the inevitable  and usually supernatural  threat alone but  finally  is pressured into keeping his story under wraps   but a winning one  further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits  making the show a great deal of fun   that said  quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired  for instance  the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment    not to mention the fact that these were restricted to  minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes  in the case of the werewolf  again  he s never seen biting anyone but  somewhat foolishly  is made to merely throw people around    while the hero s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots  there s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode  often  but not exclusively  revolving around mcgavin s relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage    to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere  the setting  for the most part  is chicago  and suspense  to make the ride even more pleasant  there s a bouncy score by gil melle  and jerry fielding   for the record  the monsters encountered  but not always defeated  by kolchak throughout the series are  a revived jack the ripper  a variety of cults  voodoo  native american  aztec  aliens  vampire  werewolf  going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner  doppelganger  satanist  swamp creature  mass of electricity  robot  apeman  witch  headless motorcyclist  succubus  a knight s armor taking a murderous life of its own  the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast   featuring john dehner as a morose police captain  hans conried and robert emhardt  helen of troy  and crocodile  some of the actors  other than those playing kolchak s co workers  return in the same roles   keenan wynn and ramon bieri  both as officers of the law  john fiedler  as a shrewd morgue attendant  and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero  if i were pressed to choose the finest  or most entertaining  episodes  i d lean towards horror in the heights  co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer  and the afore mentioned the knightly murders   while  as the weakest  i d go for the werewolf  due to reasons i ve already explained  and chopper  based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob gale   unfortunately  the set contains no extras  it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak  the night stalker  as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing  or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today  in fact  kolchak himself   in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise   returned in a   revival  this version is available at my local dvd rental outlet but  for various reasons  i m not sure i d want to check it out so soon after the   classic
