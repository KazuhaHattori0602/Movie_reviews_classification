i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title  this movie is not primarily about the act of  riding giants  but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport  riding giants  to change the emphasis   in my teens i lived a block from the wedge  one of the hardest breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world  i ve been out in  to  foot surf  and have ridden and been hammered by   and  foot waves on many occasions  that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film  the idea that jeff clark  to all appearances a normal mortal  could get away with riding maverick s by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp  the first safety rule of any water sport is  never surf dive swim by yourself  he went where sane people would not  and lived to tell about it  i wouldn t go out there if the water were   degrees and the sharks all left    in the world of warm water  the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body  these are not just scary waves  these are uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves  when we see laird hamilton not only surviving  to  foot waves  i can hardly type those numbers  but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon  i m blown away  there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world    this a great film  i gave it a   instead of a   only because it neglects to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton kalama crew  and i think they deserved mention  splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a   it is
