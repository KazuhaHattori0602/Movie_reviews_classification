i don t know why some people criticise that show so much   it is a great  funny show   probably not the right material for mainstream prime time  but still   the family dynamics are funny  and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows  the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious  the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried   roy jibes are only just above average  but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing   this show was well worth the   pounds i paid for it   rating
