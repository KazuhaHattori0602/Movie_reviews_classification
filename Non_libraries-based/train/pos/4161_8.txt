  i first saw this film last october  about six months from now  and again yesterday  i feel that i must first tell about the thing that bothered me the most in this film  it seems very rushed  then again what can you expect from   hours long movie that tries to tell the main points of over   episodes long series  whatever the case  the situations change with a fast speed and tetsur  meets other important characters in the story mostly by pure chance  i feel makers should have either left something out or include extra   minutes    however  there s no arguing that ge  has deserved its place as an anime classic  the animation itself  very faithful to the style of matsumoto s manga  is detailed and beautiful to watch  even after almost   years of its release the animation has not become  out of date  but puts many later anime films in shame  the music through out the film is enjoyable to listen even if somewhat  old  these day  it was the  s after all  i have not heard any english dub of this film so i can only comment the japanese audio which is good  voice actors give life to their characters  most memorable ones being masako nozawa  mainly known as the voice of goku through out the entire dragon ball saga  as the excited and young tetsur  and masako ikeda as the calm and mysterious maetel  the supporting characters are not left in shadows  but also have a life of their own  most memorable to me being waitress claire    the story itself is suitable for both those who are looking for an entertainment for couple of hours  as well as for those who try to find deeper messages  ge  is an entertaining adventure film but can also be seen as tetsur s journey from boyhood to manhood  the whole film is told from his point of view  so we are forced to feel what he feels  i think many people can relate to tetsur  for despite the fantasy elements  he is a very realistic character  young  hot headed  awkward and naive  we follow him as he starts to see differences between humans and machines and come to conclusion whether he wants the mechanical body or not  maetel on the other hand stays as a mystery in the film and even in the end  when she reveals who and what she really is  it doesn t much answer to anything  maetel can be seen as a dream of a growing young man  always close but just out of reach    it s is the strange yet beautiful relationship between tetsur  and maetel that still awakes talking and questions  and fascinates after the decades  people have argued if their relationship is that of a two friends  of mother and son  or of two possible lovers  which wakes a lot of critique since maetel s age is unknown and tetsur  hasn t even reached his puberty yet  without any means to sound deep  i think the best term to describe them is  soul mates  there is no question that the two feel devotion  caring and love for each others  yet it goes beyond that of friendship  family and lovers  i think that if their relationship would be stuffed in any of those categories  it would take something out of the whole film and of the characters  the ending scene  even if you already know what is going to happen  is still very touching and memorable   all in all  despite the rushing of plot and some corny scenes  galaxy express   holds its place as an anime classic amongst the films like katsuhiro otomo s akira   and mamoru oshii s ghost in the shell   the film is directed by rintaro  who had previous experience of leiji matsumoto s works as he had worked in captain harlock series  later rinatro directed a wonderful looking metropolis   that also questions the difference between humans and machines    galaxy express     is a classic that should be seen at least once by every anime fan
