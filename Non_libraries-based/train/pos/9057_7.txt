let s keep it simple  my two kids were glued to this movie  it has its flaws from an adult perspective  but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it    and the pepsi girl was excellent   and kimberly williams was pretty gosh darned hot  although she s not in the film very much  so don t get too excited there   not that s it s really a bad thing  but it is the kind of movie you watch just once  don t buy the dvd   enjoy   did i mention kimberly williams   that was for the dads
