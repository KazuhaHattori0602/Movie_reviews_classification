hayao miyazaki name became prominent with spitied away  however what is often overlooked are director s first film efforts  who remembers that spielberg directed duel or george lucas directed thx   i remember seeing fragments of this movie   almost certainly the last   minutes in late  s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation  so when i found a copy in a well known store for   i couldn t resist but buy it  the odd thing is that the last   minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it  memory is funny that way   viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like jean  moebius  giraud some of the artwork is  i can only assume some influence here   when pazu catches a falling girl  sheeta  his adventure really begins   the quest for laputa   a reference to jonathan swift s overlooked portion of gulliver s travels  with healthy references to jules verne it s a basic good vs  bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on laputa   this is the portion that is strongest in my memory   the  pastoral  ecological aspect of laputa returned to nature   the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree  this is  in my opinion  the highlight of the movie   the views of the surface of laputa  as opposed to the mechanised underground   although this is the dichotomy of this movie   to show that even technology cannot overcome nature   the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals  the ending of the movie silent running is almost exactly the same   it is incredibly stylish  i would not say  slick    very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings  airships and the design and look of just about everything   myazaki is a true master of this kind of japnanese anime  buy this movie and treasure it
