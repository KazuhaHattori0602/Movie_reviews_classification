having previously seen the abridged print presented by david shepard  i finally got a hold of a complete or nearer complete version  which was about   minutes compared to the  minute version more widely distributed  the shepard print for image entertainment is certainly of superior quality  and the best parts are there  but it s nonetheless good to see the rest of the film and fill in some loose story ends   in the shepard print  the film ends with mary stating   you see  i ve changed my mind i m never going home  yet  in the complete version  mary and kenneth driscoll end their relationship soon after that scene   mary returns home to the country   and driscoll rekindles his relationship with vivian  this additional footage develops the character vivian  who had little relevance in the shepard version  moreover  in the complete version  the film begins in the new jersey countryside with mary  where she reads and fantasizes about her ideal lover  she s disappointed by the reality of the advances by farm  chore boy  johnny applebloom  a character completely absent from the shepard version  but after her affair with driscoll  she returns to the country to presumably and eventually become a farmer s wife   regardless of the print   a girl s folly  is a good little film for   made by one of the top directors of the  s maurice tourneur  in it  tourneur takes plenty of jabs at his own business  including by playing a caricature of himself the director of the film within the film  the two leads also give quality performances by early screen acting standards  robert warwick  an actor playing a skirt chasing star  and doris kenyon  as an ing nue aspiring to play an ing nue on the screen   self referential films  which made film making the focus of the films  were nothing new by now  mack sennett had already parodied this type of film three years prior with  mabel s dramatic career  several aspects of this one stand out  though  frances marion s intertitles are humorous  including illustrations of the actors on a chessboard with a hand directing them remarkable for   i especially liked the film s final title cards where two observers remark on the film s happy ending   gee but ain t that romantick  and  the other replies   romance  nuthin    that s movin  pictures  fellow female screenwriter anita loos made a similar self referential conclusion to another film from    wild and woolly  both writers helped change the role of their professions in the business and art   some of the photography by tourneur and john van den broek is good  especially concerning the film making business  the use of mirrors in several scenes is a nice reinforcement of the film s self reflexivity  furthermore  the editing is exceptional  the quick crosscutting during the studio scenes is especially salient  it serves to punctuate the hectic pace filmmakers work at  especially back then
