i really like   dalmations when it came out in   now   years later i went to see   dalmations in   i thought it was fantastic but i think   is better because i think it s more funnier  more humor  and also that movie was based on the same story as the cartoon version  one hundred and one dalmations   i wonder if there are plans for   dalmations  i hope there is  maybe yes  maybe no  all of us dalmation fans will have to find out if there is going to be   dalmations in the future
