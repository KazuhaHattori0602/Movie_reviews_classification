possible spoilers re  late appearing cameos   seldom does one see so many fine   memorable character actors  almost entirely actresses to be precise  in one film  even though a few only appear for cameos  each one is a gem  the british do this mix of comedy and real life pathos better than anyone imo  so it is no surprise that most of the actors are brits   the music is great  no doubt much had to be dubbed  does leslie caron  really  play the bass so well  maybe   who knew  but clio lane was unmistakably herself   her warm visceral sound still turns my crank like few other jazz singers   as an aging musician myself  not quite as old and certainly not in that class of course  it was a heartening film as well   a great film for anyone whose wondering if they re past it in their profession or avocation whatever it may be  and of course a great celebration of the life of the stage   i missed a little of the opening  but a provisional     and it certainly makes we want to see the whole thing
