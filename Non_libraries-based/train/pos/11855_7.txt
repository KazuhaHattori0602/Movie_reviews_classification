wow  something of a surprise  though flawed  it is far better that i expected   the brand new space liner arcturus with some   passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to jupiter  without warning  the ship s cerebral  central computer  sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate    soon  there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship s astrogators  penny  the captain  cary  and the director of the shipping line  kenyon   it turns out that the alarm was false and that the main cerebral is acting  erratically  the remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and  avoid personal conflicts in order to survive   the film starts out very well  the opening commercial is a very nice touch  there are obvious parallels to   a space odyssey and to the historic  sinking of the titanic  the film does slow down at times and has pacing  problems  but is generally well made and well acted
