i just saw this at the toronto film festival  and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again  it is a character driven film  and andrew and david are more than up to the task  any discussion of the plot might be  considered spoilers  so i ll just say that the storyline is clever  the acting is superb  and the effects are amazing  well filmed and well paced too  one of the best films i have seen in ages  and very refreshing in this summer of dreary  movies  it had the audience laughing the whole time  see it if you can   i particularly liked the  candy bar  candy bar  scene
