hi all i am a chess enthusiast since the age of about   i supposed i am quite obsessed by chess  but hopefully not as much as the central character in this film   in this film  the central character reflects a real chess player called curt von bardeleben who committed suicide in   he is famous for a game he played against steinitz  where a beautiful combination was played by steinitz  instead of resigning  he simply walked out of the tournament hall  never to return   the social ineptness of the central character is unfortunately a treat of some of the more serious grandmasters you sometimes get in chess tournaments  chess i suppose is a very big sacrifice  and you can sometimes end up imbalanced in other areas of life  a major example of this is the chess legend bobby fischer  although a genius  he was also very disturbed in many ways   in the film  a world championship match is depicted  as between an italian grandmaster and luzhin  the format is a knockout  which actually the world governing body of fide has sometimes employed as a format itself   going from   players to just   in the final  but this was a group knockout   which also depicts a realistic format  where the winners of each group play against each other   the position before adjournment makes for a fascinating chess puzzle in itself  in fact  i have done a youtube video about it  for you to explore the winning combination in detail   enjoy    best wishes tryfon
