great fun  i went with   friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film  we came to see different one but after   minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie  in the first part you just keep asking yourself about this  malinski  and  bellini  stuff  there are many more examples of this lingo  and because they keep repeating the same jokes  with different twists  they get funnier and funnier  in search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next  until half of the film was over we didn t even know the name of this movie because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak viewing  but we sure had a good time  the house was loaded  appr    people  and i think about half of them didn t like it and the other half loved the film  if you like weird comical movies with great dialogue you will love it  apart from clooney this movie deserves a lot better than the   imdb rating it has at the time i write this  but when more ppl have seen it i am sure it will go up    is reasonable i guess  i would give it an   out of     out of   after a few beers
