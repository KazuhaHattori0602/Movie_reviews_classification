as shallow as it may sound  i actually delayed my viewing of  the barbarians  several times just because the vhs cover  as well as the picture image displayed here on the website  looks so incredibly gay  by now i wish i had watched it earlier because the movie isn t so much gay
  just trashy  cheesy  campy and enormously fun  it s almost unbelievable that ruggero deodato  director of  cannibal holocaust  of all people  was the man responsible for this comical cash in on the contemporary popular sword   sandal fantasy flicks  particularly schwarzenegger s conan movies  the film opens with a terrific  once upon a time  type of off screen narrator  introducing us to the ragneks  their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers  in other words  the ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks  their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy kadar kidnaps the ragneks  beautiful queen canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby  meanwhile  and as some sort of amusing waste of time  the two orphan twin brothers gore and kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they re unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death  instead of that  however  they escape and develop a plan to free their queen  actually  the plot isn t half as bad as i initially feared  but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers  on screen chemistry  the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy monsters  like a dragon with adorably cute eyes  some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp  the soundtrack and make up effects are great and our almighty director deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace  the barbarian brother s acting capacities are much better than i anticipated  apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds  the supportive cast is splendid as well  eva la rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl cara  virginia bryant is indeed bewitching like richard lynch states on several occasions and the lovely sheeba alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut shaped hair style  i kid you not  last but not least   the barbarians  stars everybody s favorite eyes in the hills creep michael berryman as the appropriately named dirtmaster  i know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the village people  but  the barbarians  really is a must see italian exploitation highlight
