i married a japanese woman   years ago  we re still together   however in the  s it would never have been as easy   life in the military had been mined for action  drama  and comedy for years by this point  mined to death  the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover  this is old hat today  but then  marrying an asian back then meant you either owed somebody something or you were a freak of some sort  this touched on both possibilities along with the third  maybe it is love    brando did his usual good job  garner did a better job than he usually does  he s good  but this showed how good he could be  umecki chan had a helluva debut here and while i think she earned her statue  she didn t really stretch  it was a role that no one who hadn t been overseas would have recognized and the newness was the corker   the real scene stealer was red buttons  red was the best thing in this film  bank on it  and the japanese lifestyles were shown in an admirable light as well   a classic
