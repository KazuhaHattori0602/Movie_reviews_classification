my name is john mourby and this is my story about paperhouse  in may   i saw alfred hitchcock s psycho  i was very scared and deeply disturbed  i began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way  but none where satisfactory  amongst those tried and failed were the birds  night of the living dead  the silence of the lambs  the blair witch project  ring  the evil dead  the sixth sense    days later  the texas chainsaw massacre  halloween  near dark  alien  peeping tom  the cell  rosemary s baby  don t look now  witchfinder general  friday the  th and the omen  that should confirm i was desperate  long after i had stopped searching i found out about paperhouse 

   paperhouse is based on a favourite book that i own  called marianne dreams  paperhouse had also come up in some of the books i had found on horror films  but they didn t tell me about the link between book and film  i discovered the truth while on the internet  i bought the film later that day   i thought paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull  unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not  it was the answer to my prayers marianne is renamed anna in the film but most of the original story is the same  one day in school anna draws a house in her scrap book  nothing remarkable about that  then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house  and i mean genuinely unnerving  more she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld  eg an apple tree  anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world  mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house  obligingly anna draws in a lighthouse  a place to go to  but still the problem remains mark can t walk  so anna decides to draw her father in  she gets her pencil out and gets too work  but the outcome is deformed and unsettling anna particularly dislikes his eyes  quote  he looks like madman  so anna tries to rub him out and start again  but the pencil proves indelible  that means nothing can be rubbed out  then anna loses her temper and crosses out her father s eyes  i leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action   paperhouse truly is the british answer to a nightmare on elm street  the viewing of this film left me shocked and upset  but i have found what i was looking for after   years  the question is how dose the compare with psycho  answer    the old dark house    psychological parental fears    a genuine shock    and very scary music
