george cukor directs this high quality story of suspense in the theatrical world with his usual sensitive but firm touch  ronald colman s performance  which earned him an oscar  still stands up despite a few overwrought moments   it s hard to forget his haunted countenance as he struts aimlessly around social functions and tries to find meaning in his life  there are a number of interesting subtexts and cukor does an excellent job of making them clear without forcing anything too much  the script by garson kanin and ruth gordon is brilliant  mixing the rarified theater world with the seedy world of the streets and comprehensively utilizing elements from shakespeare s  king lear  as a reference to both the film s main theme of jealousy and colman s character s obsession with identity   several interesting things about this movie   superficially it could be dismissed as too flippant a treatment of the everyday problems of actors  in other words if the art of acting required such complete sublimation of individuality we would soon have a rash of psycho method actors stalking the streets  but i don t really think this story s primary concern is acting or the job art of acting per se  i think anthony s struggles represents a broader existential question  a deeply buried uncertainty about identity  there s a key  i feel  in his relationship with his ex wife britta  signe hasso  he says that he never would have or could have become a good actor without her inspiration  and at another point he explicitly states that his extreme identification with his roles began when he married her  i m not sure what to make of this but it seems important to me  especially because it s his obsession with her and jealousy of her that ultimately pushes him over the top  perhaps the implication is that anthony put himself in danger in the first place by entering into a serious relationship  marriage implies a  union of the soul  in the traditional conception  it s unusual that the male and female protagonists are divorced at the beginning of the film  it s not completely unprecedented  hawks  comedy  his girl friday  springs to mind  among others  but it is unusual and probably significant  especially in light of the fact that they do not end up resolving their romantic separation  in a way  the film could be implying that jealousy is another form of self love
