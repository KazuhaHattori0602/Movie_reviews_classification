frailty is a non gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man s delusion obsession straight into depravity  dad  we never learn his name  is a gentle man and loving father who s raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son  adam  the family s world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys  room and tells them god has given him a vision  and what a vision   the entire family s job is to destroy demons  who  of course  are disguised in human form   proceeding from this premise  the movie is unflinching in following it  dad kidnaps people demons whom god has told him to destroy  binds them  lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil  then kills them   while making his young sons watch  fenton  the older boy  is horrified  seeing only a father who s turned into a crazed murderer  adam  the younger  is uncomfortable  but trusts that dad is following god s will  eventually  dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the  demons  that god has put on dad s list  and finally  invites them to fully participate in god s mission for the family   this is not  you understand  an abusive father  he loves his children  he is only following god s instructions   this is our job now  son  we ve got to do this  when fenton  terrified and convinced his father has gone mad  says he ll report him to the police  his father explains   if you do that  son  i ll die  the angel was clear on this  the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic  and warps their entire lives  the movie s structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects  a story in flashback  told in a police station to a fbi agent  the moody lighting  the stormy weather  and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory  i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story  until i remembered the real life parallel of andrea yates  who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them  even then  i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy  rather than a story of divine retribution   the movie gave me no such comfort  though  as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad s vision  and this  as much as some plot holes  posed a problem for me  regardless of the accuracy of dad s visions  regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed  where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death    roger ebert review
