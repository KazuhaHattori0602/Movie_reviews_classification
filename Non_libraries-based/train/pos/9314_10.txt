only saw this show a few times  but will live in my memory    it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends  especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guess   they say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves  maybe it was just too clever for certain people    anyhow  just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find  i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network  but alas not over here   summary  ingenious
