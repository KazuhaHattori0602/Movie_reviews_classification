this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool   i ve watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i ve seen in the two weeks   jason bigg s character was the best though   even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning   this may be a romantic comedy and i don t like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool   this film scored pretty high out of all the movie s i ve seen lately   and the rest were big budget or better publicized   good job in writing
