this is an  odysessy through time  via computer animation  supposedly th work of over   artists  made in the late  s and released in   this was cutting edge stuff for the day  i thought it was good and quite interesting in spots   most of the short scenes made no sense  just forms evolving into other forms  but that was fun to watch  this is all about visuals  not really about any kind of a story  there were some strange sequences in which odd looking men  creatures would dance around with birds overheard  all of it is computer animated which was new back then  even the term  computer animated  was not well known   it s simply a chance to show off this new technology in short bits of cartoon like happenings with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes  no words  just pictures with electronic music  stoners must have really loved this   it s a nice  intriguing   minutes of  eye candy  and  head candy  by today s cg effects this may have lost impact  but i think you d still be entertained by this
