the h g  wells classic has had several incarnations  the   speilburg version and the classic   version but only this one stays completely true to the book  nothing is changed nothing is removed   originally released as a  hour film  the director re cut the film down to  hours of pure excellence  its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that  wells would be proud of  the story is as everyone remembers  martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines  the people of  th century earth are ill prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth   the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager   million budget  today b movies have larger budgets
