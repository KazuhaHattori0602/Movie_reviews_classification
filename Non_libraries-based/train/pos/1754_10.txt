this movie starts out hilarious from about the   second mark  and continues it throughout the movie  i cannot recall a scene where i didn t turn to look at people laughing with me  he is the perfect actor for this roll because of the way he looks and the way he dressed   the comedic parts were great to see from actors not very big or popular  as you can see people do like this movie it is currently rated   on imdb  i think it should be in   lets put it this way i haven t seen this funny of a movie since american pie or the original vacation  see it if you want a laugh  i give this movie   of the highest thumbs up i have ever given since i found out about imdb  great movie site
