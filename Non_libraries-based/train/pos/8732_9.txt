lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson s early bean performances  and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work  something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages  in a way that just makes you feel good  a bug s life has that same charm  it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects  because even though they talk  they still act just like real bugs  it s like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them  to imagine bugs the way a young mind does   honey  i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger  and to me  a bug s life is like a more realistic version of that movie  if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities  i try not to compare it to something like toy story  which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made  because the story of a bug s life is not quite as good as toy story s  but then again  almost nothing is  the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun    the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society  mostly geared around building a harvest of food  most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers  vastly superior in strength and general meanness  and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter  we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers  who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food  the consequences will be dire  and incidentally  the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse tung s vicious forcing of food from his own people during the  great leap forward
   the fun and excitement begins when flik  the main character  sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers  you see  he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger  so he feels it s his responsibility  but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers  great for the audience  not so great for the safety of the clan    the movie was released back in the late  s  when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos  like armageddon and deep impact  independence day and the arrival  a bug s life and antz  etc  comparisons between a bug s life and antz are inevitable  although it seems clear to me that a bug s life is by far the superior film  and not only because it doesn t star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role  this is great family fun
