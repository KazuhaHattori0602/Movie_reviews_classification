a masterful treatment of james caine s  the postman always rings twice  as luchino visconti s first film shot primarily around ferrara in a soulless war torn italy  the original negative was thought destroyed but visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo realist work today  a ruggedly handsome massimo girotti and clara calamai  who had recently revealed her breasts in la cena delle beffe    star as the sensually charged and ill fated lovers who plot to kill her husband  unusual ending in which  although crime does not pay  one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime  excellent direction  script  acting  and cinematography  reportedly not as good as the french  le dernier tournant    but probably better than the us version   featuring lana turner and john garfield in the lead roles  highly recommended
