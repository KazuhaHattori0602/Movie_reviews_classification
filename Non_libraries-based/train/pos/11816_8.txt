that was great fun  i never read those chester gould comics but it s not necessary to know them  maybe there were some inside jokes i didn t figure out but what the eye doesn t see the heart cannot grieve over  this is such an ironic  colourful film and the actors are good humoured all together  the setting is similar to that in the  batman` movies  but not as dark and grey  okay  the story is not so original but there is a plot  which is not self evident  and a more or less surprising ending   with this movie  you could play an interesting game  if you watch it with friends  don t watch the credits at the beginning and then look who s the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make up
