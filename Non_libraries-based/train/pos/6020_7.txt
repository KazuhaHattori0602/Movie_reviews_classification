a beautiful new print of  zabriskie point  is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter  it s time for a full evaluation of the film  let s hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful  extras  will be out in the near future   i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore  this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a  near miss  masterpiece  the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late  s los angeles  i lived there then  and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place  kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work   the print i saw runs   hour   minutes  it is forbidden to those under    or   i can t remember  i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print  spoiler   i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut  what appears today seems rather tame by current standards   there is no soundtrack music until almost   hour into the film  before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts  etc  antonioni was very daring to do this  i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non actors mark frechette and daria halprin  this time frechette did not bother me  halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues   much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me  one shot is in a different aspect ratio   distorted by the wide screen  of course  there is actual staged footage  but not all that much   i m still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane  it looks like he really did some of the flying   there s no blue screen or double in some shots   i hope to get back to see the film a second time  recommended highly to all antonioni fans
