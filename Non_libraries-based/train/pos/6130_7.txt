surprisingly good  the acting was fun  the screenplay was fun  the music was cheesie fun  the plot was stupendously fun  this was a fun movie to watch and to give your brain some rest  parts of the plot and quotes i found to be very creative    out of   actually for what it was  it would deserve a   out of   you are not supposed to compare this to an arthouse film or to a bloody slasher film
