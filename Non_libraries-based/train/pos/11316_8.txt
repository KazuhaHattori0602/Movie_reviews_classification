 some spoilers  i have not read the james m  cain novel  `the postman always rings twice  on which this movie was based  so i cannot compare this film version to it  but i have seen and love the   us version  also entitled `postman   even better is this gem from italy  which  i have read  was `mutilated  in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime  well  no matter   what is left is a fine piece of cinema  apparently the forerunner of the neo realist movement in film making  one can certainly see why   despite whatever harsh editing did go on  a pervading sense of societal and cultural  as well as personal oppression remains  hanging heavy over the protagonists  who therefore face many limits in life   consider gino  the young drifter  not well educated  unemployed  and resorting to stowing away  stealing and conning people in order to get by  his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless   in giovanna  he sees a way out  yet he should have kept going  as giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money  her job  working at the trattoria for her husband  slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen  and her sex  in the past  she had limited options  and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner  giuseppe bregana  played by juan de landa  anyway  knowing that he would not make her happy  she tells gino that she feels sick every time bregana touches her   on the pretext of helping bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part  which he has in fact pocketed  gino wins bregana s favor  promising also to fix the broken water pump   water symbolizing life  or lack thereof  and is left alone with giovanna  they immediately start a heated  passionate  yet volatile love affair   gino soon feels stifled by the relationship  and feels the need to move on again when giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband  wanting no part of it  gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford  kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named spagnolo  a fellow train passenger  to gino  spagnolo represents a sort of freedom  and they become friends  spagnolo also symbolizes gino s morality and conscience  traveling and finding work at a carnival together  finally gino has steady employment  to his dismay  he is not yet over his love for giovanna  a month has passed when bregana and his wife go to the carnival and bregana persuades gino to go `back home  to live and work with them again  as he is handy to have around   too weak willed to resist  knowing this will reunite he and giovanna  gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple  after a while he gives in to gina s demands to get rid of her husband  once the evil deed is done  giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever  seeming to have very little conscience  while guilt and shame eat away at gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm  as much as he wants to leave her   he does again briefly  they are now inextricably linked  and must face the consequences   i liked the way the spagnolo character came back into gino s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds   that was very good  and interesting  adding another dimension to the story   while the   u s  version with lana turner and john garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters  especially the cops and the lawyers  ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone  this gives the final outcome even more potency  and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live   a minor quibble  the amount of time  hardly any  that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers  how quickly they kill the husband  there is no botched first attempt as in the u s  version  gino s very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer hooker   they quickly profess their love as well  and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met    all rather unrealistic  isn t it  i found this time frame problem quite distracting   it made me think that i must have missed something somewhere  otherwise  well worth the viewer s time  the acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout  recommended
