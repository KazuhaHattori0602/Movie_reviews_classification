the cast is excellent  the acting good  the plot interesting  the evolvement full of suspense but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely   minutes long  if more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots  it would have a much better effect  another   minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one
