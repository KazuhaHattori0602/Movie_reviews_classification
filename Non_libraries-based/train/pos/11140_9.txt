john schlesinger s  midnight cowboy  is perhaps most notable for being the only x rated film in academy history to receive the oscar for best picture  this was certainly how i first came to hear of it  and  to be completely honest  i didn t really expect much of the film  this is not to say that i thought it would be horrible  but somehow i didn t consider it the sort of movie that i would enjoy watching  this is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners   a remarkable combination of stellar acting  ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack  everybody s talking  at me  i don t hear a word they re sayin  make this film one of the finest explorations of life  naivety and friendship ever released   young joe buck  then newcomer jon voight  dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy  travels from texas to new york to seek a new life as a hustler  a male prostitute  women  however  do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services  and joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up  during these exploits  joe comes to meet enrico  ratso  rizzo  dustin hoffman  a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con joe out of all his money  when they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament  ratso offers joe a place to stay  and  working together  they attempt to make  largely dishonest  lives for themselves in the cold  gritty metropolis of new york   joe had convinced himself that new york women would be more than willing to pay for sex  however  his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman  sylvia miles  twenty dollars  though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent  ratso is just as na ve as joe  ratso  with his painful limp and hacking cough  is always assuring himself that  if only he could travel to the warmth of miami  somehow everything would be all right  this misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of lennie and george of john steinbeck s classic novel   of mice and men   shot largely on the streets of new york   midnight cowboy  is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums  watching the film  we can almost feel ourselves inside ratso s squalid  unheated residence  our joints stiff from the aching winter cold  the acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism  with both voight and hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society  hoffman  in particular  is exceptional in his role  i m walkin  here  i m walkin  here  managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in  s  the graduate  both stars were later nominated for best actor oscars  also nominated for acting   bafflingly   was sylvia miles  for an appearance that can t have been for more than five minutes  though both ultimately lost out to john wayne in  true grit   midnight cowboy  eventually went on to win three oscars from seven nominations  including best picture  best director for schlesinger and best writing for waldo salt    midnight cowboy  is told mainly in a linear fashion  though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at joe s past  rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about  the audience is invited to think about it for themselves  and how these circumstances could have led joe onto the path he is now pursuing  the achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope  but a large amount of uncertainty  gritty  thought provoking and intensely fascinating   midnight cowboy  is one for the ages
