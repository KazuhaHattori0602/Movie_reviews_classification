this isn t the comedic robin williams  nor is it the quirky insane robin williams of recent thriller fame  this is a hybrid of the classic drama without over dramatization  mixed with robin s new love of the thriller  but this isn t a thriller  per se  this is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper   also starring sandra oh and rory culkin  this suspense drama plays pretty much like a news report  until william s character gets close to achieving his goal   i must say that i was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse  it felt more like i was watching a guy  williams  as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective  in other words  it felt real  and i was able to subscribe to the premise of the story   all in all  it s worth a watch  though it s definitely not friday saturday night fare   it rates a   from   the fiend
