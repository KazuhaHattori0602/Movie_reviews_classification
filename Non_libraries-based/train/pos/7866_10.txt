page     out of   stars  madhvi  konkona sen  enters her boyfriend s house and its empty  she looks here and there and then goes in his bedroom and you get the picture    ah  another girl 
 that two timing baddie and yes indeed he his two timing her but it s a guy this time around  and i say  brilliant   end of spoilers  the above scene is not a spoiler really   but for me it was so i didn t want to take a chance   when asked upon as how was this film  my friend answered  oh  it just an expos  of the p  people  which made me believe that ill be watching a stupid movie if nothing more  when i went to the theater  i thought to myself   i better get a pen and a paper to jot down the bad things about this film  but i was proved entirely wrong
 and then some because i could muster only the goods  this film was great  great  not because it is offbeat and noncommercial cinema like storyline but because of the cleverness in the screenplay and how this movie tells you how to handle a movie brilliantly which could have been a dumb and senseless movie if given in the wrong hands   konkona sen sharma is grace  she is so damn beautiful who has nailed her role perfectly as if she was born to play this part  one of the most charming actresses i ve ever seen  but this is not the only performance which is good in the film  there s sandhya mridul  boman irani and atul kulkarni  particularly sandhya mridul who just fires up the screen   and guess what even the unusually accented tara sharma speaks normally   the movies stars off with some silly old parties of the hush hush celebrities of the film industry et al and you get the idea of what this movie will be about  and for about half hour through the film you feel just about the same  but then the movie picks up the pace grabs onto a good storyline and never lets go of it  even boman irani agrees to that statement    it was a good story  madhvi   thank you  the great thing is that it tackles the issue of how silly these people are with style and does not make it over done and also tackles the social issues and does not make them boring  in the end its all a roller coaster ride and madhvi informs us that by just smiling at all these people  just the reason why i love watching films  ecstatic film making  the screenplay is beautiful  clever and witty
