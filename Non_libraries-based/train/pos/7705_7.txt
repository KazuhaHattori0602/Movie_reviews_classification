i ve now seen this one about   times  so there must be something about it i like    s us sci fi movies were pretty much a mixed bunch  they were either intelligently made and or thought provoking or cheap and laughable cheese  forbidden planet is a bit of both  but in that rarity for the genre  colour   it also had a head start with the script   although shakespeare might not have recognised it  it was based on his timeless play and thus guaranteed a certain amount of longevity itself if made well   it s the story of one mans murderous id artificially magnified infinitely by machines a dead race left switched on   years before  along the way the plot bristles with  s stereotypes and corn so pure you wonder sometimes why you re watching it  but always do  that love triangle thing yuk  disney s cartoonery still holds up well  and the cartoon backgrounds straight off the covers of galaxy magazine etc look good even after   years  robbie driving the car over the desert in the far distance is a hoot though   all in all  with all faults  the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such a pristine print survives
