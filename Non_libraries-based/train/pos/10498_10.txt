it s a bit easy  that s about it   the graphics are clean and realistic  except for the fact that some of the fences are  d  but that s forgiveable  the rest of the graphics are cleaner than goldeneye and many other n  games  the sounds are magnificant  everything from the speaking to the sfx are pleasant and realistic   the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times  but it s the same for every platform game  like banjo kazooie and donkey kong    i got this game as a christmas present in   and since then  i have dutifully gotten   stars over   times
