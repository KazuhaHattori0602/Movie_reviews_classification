this film has a powerful philosophical ending  but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning   youth alienation in the late  s  from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman  is the obvious theme of  zabriskie point  neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience  a fact that actually enhances the film s message  having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism  as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them   this is not a script driven film  except for the first ten minutes  it is mostly visual  with stunning cinematography  the beautiful naturalistic images seem other worldly  and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria   i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors  many scenes cry out for  riders on the storm   even so  i like this film  it s different  it s unique  it is artistic and imaginative  and the desert badlands are beautiful   as the years go by   zabriskie point  seems more and more attractive  it conveys the mood of the late  s in america  it is amazingly artistic  in a bohemian sort of way  and the film s last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing
