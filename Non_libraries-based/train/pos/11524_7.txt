this is a quirky little movie  and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well   it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist  and is partly about following his dream  partly about the dreams of others  and all about the travails of showbiz  i thought the movie was charming  and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile   alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was  and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship   not for everyone  probably  but if you like movies about the journey  then i think you ll like this one
