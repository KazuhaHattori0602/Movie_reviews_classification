tachigui  the amazing lives of the fast food grifters japanese title  tachiguishi retsuden  director  mamoru oshii featuring  toshio suzuki  mako hyodo  kenji kawai  shinji higuchi  katsuya terada narrated by koichi yamadera    way back in   mamoru oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature ghost in the shell  which helped consolidate anime s international acceptance   and also burrowed itself into andy and larry wachowski s overall concept for the matrix   the movie s sequel  innocence   was the inaugural japanese animated film to compete for the palme d or at cannes  and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plot   always the trendsetter  oshii has now presented us with tachigui  the amazing lives of the fast food grifters   which has absolutely nothing to do with ghost in the shell  nor japanese anime for that matter   say hello to oshii s creation  superlivemation  not quite animation  nor exactly live action  instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of   snapshots  which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut out fashion reminiscent of balinese puppetry  the movement itself is a stilted  stop motion style that echoes sequences from shinya tsukamoto s experimental tetsuo  iron man     i couldn t think of any method but this one  said oshii in a recent interview with the daily yomiuri   i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation   the cast choice is equally enigmatic  kenji kawai   who also composed the superlative soundtrack   appears as a ravenous burger fanatic  while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion  others include katsuya terada  who dabbled with oshii on blood  the last vampire  and shinji higuchi   a special effects whiz who s worked on godzilla movies   koichi yamadera s narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary   which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamadera s extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebop   and the plot itself is a bizarre re imagining of post wwii japan in the context of various fast food off shoots   from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand up bars  american dogs in the heat up trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds  inspired burger chain restaurants   food is a primal root of desire  asserted oshii  by way of explanation    thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer  the fast food grifters of the title  people who don t like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies    oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the  art  of eating food on the streets   something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country  and which goes some way toward explaining the use of  tachigui  in the title   the director of live action movies  avalon  stray dog  as well as animation  oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums  the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats   at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating  just don t ask what it s all really supposed to mean  oshii s films  which are equal parts cerebral and innovative  are often not particularly clear story wise  where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor   here you ll find kentucky fried rat  death by hula hoop  the world s fastest samurai burger chef   and in the movie s very nature of surrealism   this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut  and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch  so it shouldn t come as any surprise that at one stage a b  bomber does a fly  through in a yoshinoya look alike franchise  the  year old writer director seemed to think this natural   the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality  he suggested   of course     by andrez bergen
