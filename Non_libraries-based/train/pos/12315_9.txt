there are   comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism  this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it   it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my  year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action  to the humour and even to the beautiful music score   i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk  i will certainly be adding it to my collection
