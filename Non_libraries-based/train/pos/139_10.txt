first of all  riget is wonderful  good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time  nice combination of strange  dogma  style of telling the story together with good music and great actors  but unfortunately there s no  the end  as for me it s unacceptable  i was thinking  how it will be possible to continue the story without helmer and drusse   and i have some idea  i think lars should make riget iii a little bit different  i m sure that  rd part without helmer wouldn t be the same  so here s my suggestion  mayble little bit stupid  maybe not  i know that lars likes to experiment  so why not to make small experiment with riget  i think the only solution here is to create puppet driven animation  like for example  team america  by trey parker  or even computer  d animation  i know it s not the same as real actors  but in principle i believe it could work  only this way it s possible to make actors alive again  for riget fans this shouldn t be so big difference   if the animation will be done in good way average  watcher  will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie  the most important thing now is the story  it s completely understandable that it s not possible to create riget   with the actors nowadays  so why not to play with animation  and  look for the possibilities that it gives to you  even marketing one  great director finishes his trilogy after   years using puppet animation  just dreams   i hope to see riget   someday  or even to see just the script  i m curious how the story ends  and as i expect  everybody here do   greets  slaj  ps  i m not talking about the  kingdom hospital  by stephen king
