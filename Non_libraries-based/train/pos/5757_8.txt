this movie could only originate in the  s  it s a bizarre action movie set in a small california workers town  some sort of mill or plant is closing down  so suddenly  rampant bad behavior is occurring in the streets  the townsfolk s are fed up  so ben arnold  jan michael vincent  goes to another town to recruit his brother  aaron  played by kris kristofferson  aaron is a vietnam vet who looks and acts a little
off balance  he hangs out with a bunch of other surly vietnam vet s  they come into town to clean it up  they become deputized  but underneath their good deeds  they are actually running gambling houses  asking for protection money  etc  it takes a while for people to catch on  and in a biblical cain and abel showdown  vincent has to take on his older brother  there s an interesting blue collar sleaze atmosphere to this movie  which makes it interesting  note the cock fighting scene  vincent is almost too angelic in this role   he thinks so highly of his brother  he cannot conceive of him committing the evil deeds he s accused of  he finally comes to his senses   his girlfriend  victoria principal  is brutally shot in the back   he himself is beaten up in his home  kris kristofferson is creepily effective as aaron  he coolly denies any wrong doing  and even gently coos and talks to vincent s young daughter  she refers to him as  uncle aaron  even while he s threatening her father s life  all the while smiling  vincent and kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other  bernadette peters makes an interesting appearance as a  saloon  girl who attracts aaron s attention  this is a good  s action movie  if you can find it  it is not available on dvd yet
