i loved good times with the rest of many of you  i love reading intelligent and insightful commentary  the writers on this show were fantastic and the actors were beyond talented  to answer strawberry   the neatest commentary to the other superior and positive commentary what happened was that james was killed in an accident  i believe i remember that it was a trucking accident or car accident  and it was the saddest episode  when it first aired and i was a tiny thing it was so sad to me   florida and the children actually get out of the projects and even become neighbors with willona  wilnona  and that is how the very last show ended   all of the children achieved their dreams and found opportunity in each of their dreams  it was a wonderful ending and i cried because i was happy for them and the show seemed so realistic that i actually believed in their fate  i hope that this kind of ending rings true in actually for many   a great show and many other great shows followed including benson and the jeffersons  this was an awesome period for african american television and the best writers were awesome at that time  tv land is awesome for the memories and i just love it because i cannot stand the junk that we are watching today  somebody bring back the  s and  s quickly your intelligent viewers are a dying breed out here and we need better material   love  a tv land original sitcom junkie of the  s and  s  as they sing in  all in the family those were the days
