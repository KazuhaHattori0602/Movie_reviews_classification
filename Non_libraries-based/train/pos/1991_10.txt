yes  as unbelievable as it may be  in   a musical won the academy award for best picture   and it was the third musical to win that award in a five year period  the first being my fair lady in   and then the sound of music in   the difference between my fair lady  the sound of music and oliver  however is that oliver  is immeasurably better  no comparison  the first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust oliver  the acting is great  the songs are great  the story is great and the dancing is great  this movie is dynamic  topical  relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york  oliver  offers a portrayal of poverty in  th century london  england that evokes sympathy without being condescending  oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver  the other actors and actresses  especially ron moody and shani wallis  are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures
