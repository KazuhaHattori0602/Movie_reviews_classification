  website  but have now been released on dvd  there are   episodes on the dvd and a brief synopsis follows     the neighbor  we meet the next door neighbor  and find out three things about him  he has a really nice shed  he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks     the treadmill  we find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise  but the husband doesn t really think it s a good idea  in the end  the exercise treadmill is victorious     the doctor  the father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire  the doctor s examination is quite thorough  if not unconventional  but the diagnosis is  you are perfectly normal   but we knew that     a friend visits  after an altercation with the new clothes hoist  a friend comes to visit  believe it or not  he has one  but after we meet him we can understand why  no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are     get the stick  we meet another neighbor  he has a stick stuck in his mouth  although we never find out how it got there  unfortunately  removing the stick from his neighbor s mouth ends up being harder  and more violent  than expected  but he is victorious in the end  jesus some people can be ungrateful     my teeth are bleeding  this was my favorite episode  and was also the most mind  numbingly repetitive and annoying  hmm  what does that say about me  not sure why the son s teeth started bleeding  but believe me when i say it was minimal to the plot of the story  which is an oxymoron  as the story had no plot  but did have a funny ending  involving a fly     uncle bob  after meeting uncle bob  and uncle bob s wife  we get a distinct feeling that the dumbland gene pool is very shallow  uncle bob is a sickly fellow  i shan t elaborate  lest i spoil it for you  uncle bob s wife definitely wears the pants in his family  and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist  and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard     ants  after the home gets infiltrated with ants  and a misbegotten attempt to bug spray them goes awry  he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug spray and starts hallucinating  the ants put on a fabulous song and dance show  he goes berserk trying to kill them  winds up in a full body plaster  and lets just say  the ants get their vengeance in the end   as bad as these stories are  there is something that kept compelling me to watch them  they do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors  david lynch  maybe they were an outlet for him  to get rid of some of his violent thoughts  i did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes  many aspects are absurdly funny
