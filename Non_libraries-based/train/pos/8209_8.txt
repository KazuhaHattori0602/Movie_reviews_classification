clint eastwood would star again as the battle weary detective harry callahan  but would also direct the fourth entry in the  dirty harry  series   sudden impact  again like the other additions  brings its own distinguishable style and tone  but if anything it s probably the most similar to the original in it s darker and seedy moments  and bestowing a classic line  go ahead  make my day 
 but some of its humor has to been seen to believe  a bulldog
 named meathead that pisses and farts  oh yeah  however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco   the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes  after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood  he s ordered to take leave  but it falls into a working one where he heads to a coastal town san paulo  where a murder has occurred similar in vein  bullet to groin and between eyes  to his case  there he begins to dig up dirt  which leads to the idea of someone looking for revenge   to be honest  i wasn t all that crash hot on eastwood s take  but after many repeat viewings it virtually has grown on me to the point of probably being on par with the first sequel  magnum force  this well assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon  even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time  quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging  it s like he s experimenting with noir thriller touches with character driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework  his use of images is lasting  due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics  dark tones  brooding lighting
 like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure  harry with his new   automag handgun  moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks  it s a striking sight that builds fear  mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor  it seemed to come off  a major plus with these films are the dialogues  while i wouldn t call  sudden impact  first rate  it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines
  you re a legend in your own mind  don t you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip  before pulling out his piece  the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense
 the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages  lalo schfrin would return as composer  after  the enforcer  had jerry fielding scoring  bringing a methodical funky kick  which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get go  bruce surtees  an eastwood regular  gets the job behind the camera  where he did a piecing job with  dirty harry  and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes  but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments   eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch  going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan  this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry s quest for justice
 by the badge even though he doesn t always agree with it  i just found it odd
 a real change of heart  across from him is a stupendous performance by his beau at the time sondra locke  her turn of traumatic torment  being senselessly raped along with her younger sister  is hidden by a glassily quiet intensity  when the anger is released  it s tactically accurate in its outcome  paul drake is perfectly menacing and filthy as one of the targeted thugs and audrie j  neenan nails down a repellently scummy and big mouthed performance  these people are truly an ugly bunch of saps  pat hingle is sturdy as the chief of the small coastal town  in smaller parts are bradford dillman and the agreeably potent albert popwell  a regular in the series   but under different characters  how can you forget him in  dirty harry 
 yes he is bank robber that s at the end of the trademark quote  do i feel lucky  well  do ya  punk
