i don t know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb  this film  accompanied by  i am curious  blue  is a masterwork   the only thing that will let you down in this film is if you don t like the process of film  don t like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic ramming   this isn t a film that you will want to watch to unwind  it s a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece  with time  attention and care    summaries  may contain a spoiler or two   the main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film  within a film thing  but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions aren t real   the film is like many films in one     a political documentary  about the social system in sweden at the time  which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today  interviews done by a young woman named lena     a narrative about a filmmaker  vilgot sjoman  making a film  he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people he s supposed to work with     the film that vilgot is making  it s about a young woman named lena ie    who is young and very politically active  she is making a documentary  ie    she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality  and the freedom of that   the magnificence and sheer brilliance of  i am curious  yellow blue  is how these three elements are cut together  in one moment you are watching an interview about politics  and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative   another thing is the dynamic between  yellow  and  blue  which if you see one  you must see the other   blue  is not a sequel at all  i ll try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge  no other films have done it though it is a great technique   think of  yellow  as a living thing  actual events in   scenes  a complete tale   think of  blue  as all the things in between the   scenes in  yellow  that you didn t see  that is a complete tale on it s own   essentially they are parallel films  the same story  told in two different ways   it wasn t until i saw the first   minutes of  blue  that i fully understood  yellow   i hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences  because this film changed the way i looked at film   thanks for your time
