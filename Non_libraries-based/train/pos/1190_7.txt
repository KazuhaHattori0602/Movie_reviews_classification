for some reason  this film has never turned up in its original language in my neck of the woods  despite owning the tcm uk cable channel  which broadcasts scores of mgm titles week in week out  more disappointingly  it s still m i a  on dvd   even from warners  recently announced  western classics collection  box set  which does include   other robert taylor genre efforts  maybe  they re saving it for an eventual  signature collection  devoted to this stalwart of mgm  which may be coming next year in time for the  th anniversary of his passing
   i say this because the film allows him a rare villainous role as a selfish westerner with a fanatical hatred of indians and who opts to exploit his expert marksmanship by making some easy money hunting buffaloes  an opening statement offers the alarming statistic that the population of this species was reduced from   to   in the space of just   years  as an associate  taylor picks on former professional of the trade stewart granger   who rallies alcoholic  peg legged lloyd nolan  who continually taunts the irascible and vindictive taylor  and teenage half breed russ tamblyn to this end  as expected  the company s relationship is a shaky one   reminiscent of that at the centre of anthony mann s the naked spur   another bleak open air mgm western  the film  in fact  ably approximates the flavor and toughness of mann s work in this field  despite being writer director brooks  first of just a handful of such outings but which  cumulatively  exhibited a remarkable diversity  here  too  the narrative throws in a female presence  debra paget  also a half breed  to be contended between the two rugged leads   and granger  like the james stewart of the naked spur  returns to his job only grudgingly  his remorse at having to kill buffaloes for mere sport and profit is effectively realized   the latter also suffers in seeing taylor take paget for himself   she bravely but coldly endures his approaches  while secretly craving for granger   and lets out his frustration on the locals at a bar while drunk  taylor  himself  doesn t come out unscathed from the deal  like the protagonist of the treasure of the sierra madre   he becomes diffident and jealous of his associates  especially with respect to a rare   and  therefore  precious   hide of a white buffalo they ve caught  he even goes buffalo crazy at one point  as nolan had predicted  becoming deluded into taking the rumble of thunder for the hooves of an approaching mass of the species  the hunting scenes themselves are impressive   buffaloes stampeding  tumbling to the ground when hit  the endless line up of the day s catch  and the carcasses which subsequently infest the meadows  the film s atypical but memorable denouement  then  is justly famous  with winter in full swing  a now paranoid taylor out for granger s blood lies in wait outside a cave  in which the latter and paget have taken refuge  to shoot him  when granger emerges the next morning  he discovers taylor in a hunched position   frozen to death    incidentally  my father owns a copy of the hefty source novel of this  by milton lott  from the time of the film s original release  actually  he has collected a vast number of such editions   it is  after all  a practice still in vogue   where a book is re issued to promote its cinematic adaptation  likewise for the record  taylor and granger   who work very well off each other here   had already been teamed  as sibling whale hunters  in the seafaring adventure all the brothers were valiant  
which  curiously enough  is just as difficult to see  in fact  even more so  considering that it s not even been shown on italian tv for what seems like ages
