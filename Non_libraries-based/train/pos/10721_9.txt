this is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever   i am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is tish  but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit  like super cool  with a  like totally bitchin  belt and stick on rhinestones on her face   but anyways  the movie is actually one of the few  family  movies that holds your interest  i know that the begining drags  particuarly if you know what is going to happen  but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film   i wouldn t stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie  in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself  but i ll admit it here with the internet to hide behind
