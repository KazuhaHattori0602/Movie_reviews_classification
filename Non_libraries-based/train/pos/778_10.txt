i m not much of an expert on acting or other movie details  but this movie just hit me deep  i don t think i ll ever forget it  one scene especially  i think that anybody who has seen the film will know of which one i am speaking  is imprinted on my brain   i also watched the similar movie lilja  ever  as referred to by a previous commentator  it was also very moving  but not quite as straight to the point and brutal  if you are sensitive at all  either will bring tears to your eyes  but anjos do sol  angels of the sun  may stay with you forever   this is very depressing subject matter  but i think  no  i hope that the film succeeds in bringing more attention to it   more people need to see this film
