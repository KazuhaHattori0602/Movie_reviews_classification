so this made for tv film scores only a   on this site  bah  humbug  without question this   version of dickens  classic tale is the best ever made  and yes  the hound has seen the   version which was also good  but not good enough  the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version  although the acting was wonderful   george c  scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge  we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner  then by three other spirits later on that evening  scott is properly gruff as scrooge  too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson  but hey  this is george c  scott  he s never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy  he has too much dignity  and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner   the supporting performances are uniformly excellent  as are the costumes  music  and scenery   th century london comes to life in clive donner s visionary style  the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits  the important tale of morality shines through in every frame  though   you won t often find this version aired on television anymore  and that is a disappointment  the   version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household s celebration of the holiday  when the decorations come out of the basement  this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season     of   stars   the hound
