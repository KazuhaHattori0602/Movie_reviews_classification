russian emigrant director in hollywood in    william powell  is casting his epic about the russian revolution  and hires an old ex general from the czarist regime  emil jannings  to play the general of the film  and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared  evelyn brent  of   years before   try as i might  i feel it hard to warm to  the last command  for all its virtues   the docks of new york  was indubitably a great film  and  underworld  is a film i have always been craving to see  but  the last command  is rather heavy going  the premise is fascinating  but the treatment does really make the script come to life  except in the sequences set in hollywood  depicting the breadline of employable extras and the machinations of a big movie production with state of the art technology   emil jannings is  predictably  a marvelous russian general  distinguishing wonderfully between the traumatized and decrepit old ex general  transfixed in his misery  and the vigorous  hearty officer of yore   the ending is great and worth the wait  but in order to get there you must prepared to be slightly bored at times
