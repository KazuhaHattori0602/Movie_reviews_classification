 here comes the romeo division to change the paradigm   let me just say that i was blown away by this short film  i saw it  randomly  when i was in boston at a film festival and i have thanked god for it every day since  i really  truly believe i was part of a happening  like reading a tarantino script before any else did or seeing the first screening of mean streets   i am not sure what festival the short is headed to next or what the creative team has on tap for future products  but i so hope i can be there for it   again  a truly incredible piece of film making
