  s review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie  all the other negative reviews doesn t make much sense  it s almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change  very rare these days  is something bad and not worth it   i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn t make sense  martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning  the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing  we sympathize with this cold blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film s direction and writing   i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the  s range on originality alone  i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale  aka smart people  since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy s nightmare   kudos to the acting as well  for such a low budget film  you are amazed that this movie didn t hit your local cinema with the great direction  writing  and acting  please don t be fooled by the rating by imdb  this movie is worth it  i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice
