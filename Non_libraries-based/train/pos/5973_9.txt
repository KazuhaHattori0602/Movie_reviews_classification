this is a great  ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late  s  obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was  i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid  it doesn t help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown s graveyard when i was ten  turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan  so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile  but i love it now  as a   year old   i bought this dvd used for   bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover  but to my surprise  it ruled  it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal  and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd  this movie is awesome  if you love  s metal and bad movies  this one s for you
