a sequel to angels with dirty faces in name only  the angels wash their faces suffers somewhat from the usual shenanigans of the dead end kids  as a matter of fact  with the presence of the dead end kids and ann sheridan this should have been treated as an actual sequel to angels with dirty faces  at least for continuity s sake   speaking of ann sheridan  she is the one true shining light of this movie  to paraphrase a clich  ann sheridan could read from a phone book for two hours and i would buy the dvd   another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between ann sheridan and ronald reagan  unfortunately   this aspect of the film is kept too far in the background  for a better example of the sheridan reagan duo i would recommend juke girl or kings row
