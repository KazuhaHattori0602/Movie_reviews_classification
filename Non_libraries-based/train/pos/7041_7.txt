war  inc      john cusack  marisa tomei  hilary duff  joan cusack  ben kingsley  dan aykroyd  sergej trifunovic  lyubomir neikov  ned bellamy   voice of  montel williams   a hit and miss st century  strangelove   john cusack   who co wrote the script with mark leyner and jeremy pikser   stars as a jaded hit man named brand hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a middle eastern oil minister named omar sharif  yes  not that omar sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh  commandeered by the ex vice president of the usa  aykroyd  cusack s old  grosse pointe blank  co hort  doing a mean dick cheney manqu  turn here  enlisting brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical turaqistan  read  iraq afghanistan  for the american private corporation tamerlane  read  halliburton    while being briefed brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist natalie hegalhuzen  tomei  and eventually falls in love with her    meanwhile tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of eastern european teen sensation yonica babyyeah  a surprisingly decent duff aping her own celebrity with tongue  through cheek  and the idiot son of the country s leader   what follows is a bold attempt for a  st century black comedy a la  dr  strangelove  but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message  an unjust war being outsourced by american capitalism  check    while cusack riffs on his martin blank from the aforementioned  pointe  he does add some nice touches of his man in black  he does shots of tabasco sauce to take the edge off  the rest of the cast plays catch up  except sister joan who is a riot as the high strung aide  de camp for hauser and has one of the film s funniest laugh out lines   my mass communications skills are finally paying off  for the most part    cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the   degree different  grace is gone  and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve   while admirable overall the film s pace and rhythms are off largely no thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here  and it is noticeable  except for maybe the well choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah s idiotic fianc s entourage   a nice attempt yet a misguided failure   maybe next time cusack won t try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself
