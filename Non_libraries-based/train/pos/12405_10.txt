caught this film in about   on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for  many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn t like it as it was not what they wanted to see  the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you re a fan of the genre   it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself    an absolute diamond  a film i still have on video to this day  check it out
