this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea  and presents some great segments  but also some disappointing surprises  based on the tragic event of the september  th   in the united states of america  eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy  the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people  but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people   ken loach  uk  presents the best segment  about the september  th   in chile  when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa   the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine  egypt  showing the intolerance in the world  and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history  and the one of mira nair  india  showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family  whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa  when he was indeed a hero   some segments are beautiful  samira makhmalbaf  iran  shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs  while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world  the romantic claude lelouch  france  shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc  danis tanovic  bosnia herzegovina  shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows  sean penn is very poetic  showing that life goes on  and shohei imamura s story is probably the most impressive  showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace   the segment of idrissa quedraogo  birkina faso  is very naive  but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation   the segment of amos gital  israel  is very boring and manipulative  showing more violence and terrorism   the segment of alejandro gonz lez i rritu is very disappointing  horrible  without any inspiration and certainly the worst one   my vote is seven   title  brazil    de setembro   september
