now this is what i d call a good horror  with occult supernatural undertones  this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene  this proves you don t need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie   the plot revolves around   cellmates in a prison  and each of these characters  and their motives  become gradually more interesting  as the movie builds up tension to the finale  most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere  who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these   other inmates   i won t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen  there a few flaws though  the fx are not that good  but they re used effectively  the plot leaves some mysteries open  and things get very confusing towards the end  but malefique redeems itself by the time it s over   i thought his was a very good movie
