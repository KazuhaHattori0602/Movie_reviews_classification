not wishing to give  anything  away here  i would just say this technically excellent  flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half s entertainment  it will amuse  surprise  possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time  as it approaches the inevitable  but not obvious  ending without becoming clich d or predictable in any way  most definitely recommended   a previous user s comment gives   out of   for the film and   out of   for both branagh and bonham carter s outstanding performances   i agree entirely
