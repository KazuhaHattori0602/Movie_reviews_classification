playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor  paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers   not to mention the numerous other actors who ve besieged the castle before  fortunately for the fantasists  this version   with the nicely cast zelah clarke and timothy dalton   stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it  it s the right length to do the story full justice  and makes considerable use of bronte s cracking dialogue  none of that modern meddling away  cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes   the magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters  and the lives circumstances create for them to lead  jane    poor  plain and little    grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt  her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school  she arrives as a governess in the household of mr rochester  utterly friendless and alone  she represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience  but her passionate nature soon finds its touch paper in her stern  keenly intelligent  enigmatic master  to whom she is drawn  as he is to her  by forces beyond their control  rochester is the caged tiger  busy  paving hell with energy  potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him   but  pervious  through a chink or two  his character is extraordinary  he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate  but then jane is no ordinary employee  as he sees  but a dark secret  and severe trials  lie before them both   it s a pleasure to hear bronte s remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors   dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a brontean scale  if you ve only ever seen him as a not so memorable bond  you ve missed the thing he s best at  those who ve commented that his rochester is too handsome  miss the point of these dramatisations  his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer s attention  timothy dalton is just right  not always or consistently handsome  but often glancingly  strikingly so  just as it should be  and zelah clarke s jane is no wallflower  she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully  allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect   not so long ago the bbc aired an excellent dramatisation of jean rhys  enlightened and most unsettling riposte to bronte   wide sargasso sea  imagining the back story of the first mrs rochester  do check it out   you ll never see the  hero  of  jane eyre  in quite the same way again
