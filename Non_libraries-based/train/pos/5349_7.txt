the running man is one of those films that if overwatched  would become boring and depressing even   my advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks   in todays climate of tv media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary  post  s boom  forget that though  there are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film   schwarzenegger is on top form as ben  the butcher of bakersfield  richards  and the inclusion of bond belting one liners was completely inspired thety are truly leg end dary  with his rant to killian over a camera the main highlight   the design of the stalkers is authentically american  and mirrors the characterizations seen in the pc  gladiators  tv show  and the wwe as well  buzz saw s grisly end will chill any viewer to the core  as a foot note  why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour   jesse venturer and sven ole thorssen are great as backing muscle  and are arnies buds in real life  and its even got mick fleetwood in it too  what more could you ask for   i highly recommend the running man if you re looking for a great piece of entertaining action  with a glossty finish and some great characters  just don t expect an education from it  at least on surface value   quality  i bloody love it actually  you will too unless you re a thesp
