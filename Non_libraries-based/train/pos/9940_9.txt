this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works  yes  this is biology but they will never tell it is   i truly think this is the best part of this stream of  educational cartoons  i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts  skin  skeleton  and of course  organs    in the same stream  you ll find   il  tait une fois l homme  which relate the human history from the big bang to the  th century  there is   il  tait une fois l espace  as well  about the space and its exploration  but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future
