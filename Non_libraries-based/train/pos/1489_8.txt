overall the film is ok  i think it s better than sepet and much better than gubra in term of its story  its sentimental value   there are a few scenes that makes me touched  yes i agree that the boy  mukhsin  did his acting very good  brilliant  i can say that his acting is almost natural   however  the song  ne me quitte pas  by nina simone really  menaikkan  my  bulu   roma     i love the song  both the song   ne me quitte pas  and  hujan  i just downloaded the song  beautiful   and salute to yasmin  the movie s ending credit makes me touched again  we can see how yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way   i think the movie deserves that grand prix of international jury at berlin film festival   i give   out of  o stars
