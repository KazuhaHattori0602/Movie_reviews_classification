yes  i loved this movie when i was a kid  when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out   my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system  at first  my mom wasn t sure that this was an appropriate movie for a   year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it   like i said  this movie is every little boys dream
 the movie contains a terrific setting  big muscled barbarians  beautiful topless women  big bad monsters and jokes you ll only get when you get older  so  a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time  at first  i was bored  then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid  and continued watching  yeah  the experience wasn t as great as i remembered
 the acting is pretty bad  the storyline is pretty bad  the jokes weren t funny anymore  but the women were still pretty  yes  i ve grown up  even though the movie experience has changed for me  i still think it s worth   stars  for the good old times you know
