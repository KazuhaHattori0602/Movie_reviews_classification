diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now  the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today s shows where they concentrate on   or   people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side  the way mark s brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking  and if you think you do  you are wrong   diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics  not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives  everything from racism and adoption  to terrorists and technology   as for it being for old people  i am   i don t think i can be classed as old yet   i just want to know when they will be releasing all   seasons on dvd  not ntsc  so that i can watch them all in order  they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit
