i have to admit  this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears  however  i always think about things twice  and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable  i prefer taking the risk of a closer look   first what s first  the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow paced movie that doesn t try to blow you away with the actual scenes from   thumbs up for this stroke of genius  because  unlike stone s world trade center this film fortunately doesn t focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which  similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion  is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating  the psychological impact  the sheer devastation that   caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie  i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post   society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar   however  in the film blood diamond  the di caprio character says and i quote   ah  these americans  always want to take about their feelings  now  i don t want to belittle their suffer ngs  but i sure would like to make a comparison  ever since   the entire world is confronted with mementos  memorials and commemorations of   the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to   in their works  now  this huge amount of cultural products  dealing with   turn the death of   people into the biggest tragedy of this young century  the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject  and i say this with all due respect  blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion   fact is  people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people  we have a war in iraq  in afghanistan  in birma and lots of other countries  on a daily basis  we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of   simply because they are black and because their lives don t have much in common with our western lives  africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can  so  what i am saying is this  the reason why we feel more for the   victims of   and their families is because we are constantly reminded of   not a day goes by without a newspaper article  a film or a book that discusses    in conclusion  i commiserated with charlie fineman  but i wasn t sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war   you catch my thrift
