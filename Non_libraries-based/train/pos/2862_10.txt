my comment is limited generally to the first season     this superb series was one of the first to be televised in color  and it was highly influential in persuading americans that they had to buy a color television set  which was about   in   the equivalent of more than   today  how many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a  inch screen  i was eleven when the series began  and i watched it from the beginning   watching it now    years later  several things come to mind  first  many of the story lines involve the comstock lode and the heyday of silver mining  which dates to   for   the weapons and clothes are  for the most part  not authentic   the haircuts are left out of the discussion  that s basically a nitpick   and  it would have been impossible for ben to have arrived in the lake tahoe area in   and to have amassed a  square mile ranch in the next twenty years  pioneers were still trying to solve the sierra nevada problem as late as   and the gold rush did not even begin until two years later   indians are not played by native american actors  john ford was using native american actors in the  s  the bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later  that is a major nitpick for me   there are other time line problems  in season   mark twain appears  and he is depicted as a middle aged man  mark twain was   years old in   the stories also vacillate between    pre civil war  and what was more suitable for an   time frame  there are continuity problems  over and over   it is somewhat off putting  too  that there is so much killing in the first season  in time  the killing was reduced   many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant  which would be hard to believe  given the time line  but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the nation s attitudes beginning in the  s   having said all that  the acting is good  and i have come to conclude in my latter years that adam s character was drawn better than any other s  i don t think pernell roberts ever got the credit he deserved  also  season   reinforces the fact that dan blocker  hoss  was a good actor   many of the stories trace real historical events  the guest stars were interesting   this was great family entertainment  and the series stands up very well by any measure
