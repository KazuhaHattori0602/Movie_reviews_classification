being the beatlemaniac that i am  i approached two of us with a combination of fear and fascination  having seen  in his life  the john lennon story  i was quite concerned that two of us will turn out no better  the fact that aidan quinn and jared harris look absolutely nothing like john lennon and paul mccartney   even with some make up and proper hairdos   didn t help one bit   but i was more than a bit pleasantly surprised  it s probably thanks to the involvement of michael lindsay hogg  who directed let it be in   and consequently probably knew john and paul quite well  that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did   the writing credit for two of us is given to a man named mark stanfield  of whom i know absolutely nothing  i feel confident that director lindsay hogg had more than a bit to do with the script  two of us is not a biography of the beatles  it has very little plot  in fact  and takes place all in one day in new york city  what it does is imagine a meeting between john and paul in   while john lived in new york  that meeting is entirely fictitious  of course   though it can t truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place  but through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians   their intelligence  their sense of humor  their different reaction to stardom  and most of all their relationship  what made them such a great team  and what broke them up   since it s a talk movie  nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half  it s likely to bore all but true fans of the beatles  but it s a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling  and is both informative and touching  for those interested in these two musical giants  very quickly you ll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like john and paul had come to life   so intimate and convincing is the script  and so committed are the actors  two of us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses  and a tale that is both sad and funny  most certainly recommended
