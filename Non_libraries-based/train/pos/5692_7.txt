this is the second movie based on the life and times of ultra hung porn star  john curtis estes  better known as john holmes  boogie nights is also roughly based on his life  maybe someday someone is going to do a movie on the life of tommy byron instead   the problem is  that the story is not very well told  there are many law   order episodes that have more twists and turns than wonderland  and the director never gets the criminal case going with any kind of gusto  val kilmer has two problems   he is not nearly as hung as holmes is  and no prosthesis this time around  unlike in boogie nights  and he is much better looking than mope holmes    the director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast  the racist  immature lowlifes he hangs out with  or his wife  and the police don t get much in the way of characterization    the best part of the movie is eric bogosian telling paris hilton to  get lost    having said all that  anyone interested in the sleaziest side of the porn business in the  s or true crime shouldn t miss it
