what a wonderful movie  eligible for so many labels it never gets  science fiction  film noir  with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated  cultured audience the kind of english language movie only done in pre  england  and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived  and never  ever done in the usa   main characters in the man in the white suit  starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic  science reference words like  polymer  and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like  long chain molecules  and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him   the man in the white suit   is the opposite of the video game explosion movies which now   dominate world cinema  and certainly dominate major usa cinema it s a carefully acted  intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors  who play educated  accomplished people  and it s all done with comedy  charm  pathos  and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of   everybody should see this movie  and someday  somehow  some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it   it s wonderful
