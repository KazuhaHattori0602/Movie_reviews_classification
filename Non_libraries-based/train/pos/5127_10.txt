okay  so i have come a long way from houston by now  but whenever i see this movie  i am taken back to a little cowgirl s dream to one day ride the bull at gilley s   it burned down before i was of drinking age   if you grew up in in east texas  then you know this movie is an accurate depiction of contemporary life at that time  if you didn t then trust me and watch the movie  either you will join the many who love it  and at the same time strangely repulsed  or at the very least  you can make fun of the red necks   there is plenty material for poking fun  this movie doesn t try to be p c   what was that in the  s  or hide the white trash element and it is honest to the time and place   gotta be a   for me
