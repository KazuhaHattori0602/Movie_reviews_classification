in it s time  this movie had controversy written all over it  like most of verhoeven s projects   containing very graphic depictions death scenes  a parachute that doesn t open  smack  guys body on the floor  a guy being eaten by a lion  chomp  teeth in the throat  and a guy being run over by a speedboat  zoom  bloody corpse going down   but besides gore  this flick also contains some brilliant  and stunningly beautiful  scenes  filmed in the gray fisher s town that is vlissingen   thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen  in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie  a beautiful  holy  woman putting flowers in a milk can  surrounded by slabs of blood dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters  in a graveyard   the story is concluded in a frantic  but fulfilling   minutes  that don t disappoint  and will leave you sighing a breath of relief   of course with the pros come the cons  some special effects are too over the top  and are obviously done to see how far verhoeven could push the gore factor  e g  the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets  also  while the two lead actors   jeroen krabb  and ren e soutendijk  do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters  the character of herman  portrayed by the rather un charming thom hoffman  just feels enormously underdeveloped  making him hard to care for  even after his tragic death   i ve done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie  and as you can see  it s not easily summed up in words  so do yourself a favor  if you happen to find this movie somewhere  watch it   and enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece
