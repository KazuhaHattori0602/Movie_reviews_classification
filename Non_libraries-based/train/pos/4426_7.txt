i am glad i saw this film having seen some of the director s other films in the past  i thought the production values was great like the costumes and settings with the bridge  it was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons were handled   i do agree with some of the other comments about the fight scenes  they were hard to follow at times   ultimately  a moral tale  it would be interesting to know what some japanese viewers thought of the film  it is a film i would like to see again   some scenes like the ones where benkai and the prince were fighting on a  psychic  level were well done   i did come out of the cinema thinking what has just happened here  intense
