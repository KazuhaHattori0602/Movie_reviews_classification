not many reviews  hence thought i would add one   do not go by the other reviews  this was a excellent movie   rks is one of the very few indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie   ab and akshay given yet another example of great acting  as does bhoomika too  which was a little unexpected  but great to watch   am surprised there has not been much hype around release   or filmfare other awards nominations  considering how good the movie was   better then khakee i thought and i thought khakkee too was good movie   is a fairly long movie  but definitely worth it and while watching it  definitely does seem long   cant wait for rks next movie and the next ab  akshay movie they always seem to do well together  e g  waqt   bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
