there are many kinds of reunion shows  one kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven t played for twenty or thirty years  these have mixed results  `return to mayberry  despite some silliness  was okay  `return to green acres  as execrable  eddie albert used a word for the script i won t repeat here  but both it and the movie stink  `rescue from gilligan s island  filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways  though the show itself was silly even from a `gilligan s island  viewpoint  in most cases  the scripts are weak  sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing   and in comedy it s nearly always fatal for the characters to know they re being funny  new characters are introduced who don t fit the mix  in the main  these reunion shows are pretty weak  a second sort of `reunion  show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around  telling stories  reminiscing  interspersed with flashbacks from the shows  then there are movies based on the shows  which are rarely good  and movies based on the history of the show  `the brady bunch  has had both of these happen to it  with various results   `return to the batcave  uses nearly all the above  with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint  which makes it the best of the reunion shows  and has raised the bar for the others   adam west and burt ward and summoned to a showing of the original batmobile  while they are there  the car is stolen    the adam west of the movie is a man demented  he called jerry  his butler  `alfred  he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage  he s obsessed with being a crime fighter  when in fact he s merely a washed up actor  when the batmobile is stolen he not only believes it s his duty as a crime fighter to recover it  he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistant   the pursuit is largely loquacious  with west and ward reminiscing about the old days  it is broken by `flashbacks  with actors playing west and ward in the old days  the modern scenes and the `flashbacks  both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained  there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself  in ward s book about his time on the show  he spoke frankly about west s libido and also his being a skinflint  west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit  down to tips and bus fare  the clues they follow  the characters they meet  even in flashback  all fit the mentality of the old series  and there are several homages  including a fist fight with written sound effects   the whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache  there are also cameos by julie newmar  looking like she s had one facelift too many  and frank gorshin  reminding us why he has such a cult following  gorshin will be the riddler when jim carey  his obvious successor  is long forgotten  the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax   this show is a model for reunion shows   unfortunately  there are few that can fit the pattern  this show had actors replaying their old characters  young actors playing a movie about the making of the show  the actors west and ward reminiscing  and a modern day movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west  it has everything  if you loved the old show  this is the stopper on the bottle
