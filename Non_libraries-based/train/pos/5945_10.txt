let me make one thing clear
 for the most part  the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly p sses me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved  iconic characters from the pages of comic books  why  well let s take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall we
   executive no   hey there s lots of dollars to be gleaned from superhero flicks these days    executive no   good point  let s make one with haste then    we ll do a lucky dip in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon   the dip takes place and a famous superheroes name is pulled out    executive no   great  now who can we get to play the part    executive no   who s a big box office star at the moment    executive no   name of big actor  is the in thing this week    executive no   but does he really suit the role  i mean he doesn t resemble the character whatsoever    executive no   who cares  he s a big name  we ll make the film with him in it anyway    executive no   you re quite right  and besides we ll fill the entire film so chock full of glitzy special effects to appease the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway   the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally loath most modern superhero movies  all style  no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads  of course to be equitable  there are exceptions to the above rule  when hollywood does get it right   take the casting of the original  and still easily the best  superman  christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen in the x men films   but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood today
 wouldn t it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles  well in this less than ideal world  one filmmaker does just this believe it or not  by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts  his name is sandy collora  sadly  but typically  hollywood has not as of yet allowed collora to direct a full length film but luckily for us  he has given us tantalizing glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two  as of yet  famous super hero short features  one is the superb batman dead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely fictitious film called worlds finest   well  let s not mince our words here   this is absolutely awesome stuff   the casting of mr  universe winner and male model michael o hearn   who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian  makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel  in fact  in terms of physical resemblance  there has undoubtedly never been a closer approximation to the comic character   added to this clark bartram is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batman dead end  again  yet another hugely judicious piece of casting   what can i say    if only this was indeed a real  full length film  hollywood studio executives   take note  this is how it should be done   as a final note  i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has evoked from fans  tellingly  the most acerbic and vehemently adverse reactions against it clearly come once more  as similarly with batman  dead end  from a younger  less cinematically experienced audience  a fact betrayed by their somewhat grammatically primitive rants and liberal usage of base diction  such an unfortunate state of closed mindedness is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood  will no doubt derive great satisfaction from  after all  these very same misguided individuals are in all probability the exact same sort of cgi addicted  popcorn stuffing imbeciles that revel in the majority of crap that hollywood churns out by the deluge these days
