this is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships   eventually they do become spoken  but is there a chance to change anything about the situation   originally made in shanghai   and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the dai family  there is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family  history usually has weight in chinese literature and serious film   a young married couple   liyan  an invalid  and his wife yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined   a bright contrast is liyan s young sister who cannot really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way  her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved   into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor   i ended up feeling quite sad   but definitely a superior film
