this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien invaders taking over a town and many of its  men folk   the town and the players are all decked out in sort of  s style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and kitschy feel to it  some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature   all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally  rd rate to add to the amusement   these type of films often deserve a cult following
