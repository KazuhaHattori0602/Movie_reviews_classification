i could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable  the dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft core porn  in this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks   perhaps for sex as well  but not on indian tv  anyway   not being a fan of the genre i couldn t place jeff wincott  and had no leads to search from  only once brigitte nielsen traded in her futuristic nurse coif  so mayoral  for the high top fade we remember from beverly hills cop ii did i make the positive id on her   this movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early  s couture or nod and wink schlock   la paul verhoeven  can we add a genre tag for  so bad it s good
