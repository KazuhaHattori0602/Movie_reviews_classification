of all the british imperialist movies like four feathers  charge of the light brigade for example  this movie stands out as the cream of the crop  it reflects a time when  the sun never set on the british empire  get over it  i won t go into why because so many others have expressed the many reasons that makes this film great  i have visited the alabama hills and have photographed the pass through which the british marched and it remains as it was  unchanged by time and encroachment by man and vandals  and even though i know it s coming  seeing din lying dead on a stretcher and when these lines are read    yes  din  din  din   you lazarushian leather gunga din   though i ve belted you and flayed you   by the livin  gawd that made you   you re a better man than i am  gunga din    i still  at   years of age  get misty eyed and anyone who says they don t is a liar  the range of emotions within it is the mark of a great movie  like the ending of another great film  of mice and men
