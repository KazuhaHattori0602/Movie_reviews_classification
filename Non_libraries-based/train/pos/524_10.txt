i saw this movie years ago on late night television  back then it went by the title of  stairway to heaven  even as a young boy  i remember being deeply moved by the story and astounded by the visual effects of the court trial  those who have seen it know what i m talking about  such imagination  a perfect blend of romance  drama  humour and fantasy  this movie is right up there with the greatest classics ever made  citizen kane  casablanca  gone with the wind  this movie is rated extremely high by imdb voters and rightly so   over   voters rated it   out of   over   rated it   or higher out of   i was surprised it was not listed in the top   films until i realized so few have seen rated this movie  compared to those on the list  what a pity  i hope this movie gets released on dvd for region    north america  so that   i can purchase it  and   others discover this hidden treasure
