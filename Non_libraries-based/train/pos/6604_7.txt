 renaissance   was created over a period of six years  co funded by france  luxembourg and the united kingdom at a cost of around   million  the final result is a staggering accomplishment of comic book style animation  aesthetically similar to what robert rodriguez and frank miller achieved with  sin city   but this film employed motion capture with live actors to translate their faces and movements into an entirely animated format  presented in stark black and white  the film looks as though it has been hoisted from the very pages of the graphic novel on which it was based  and the futuristic city of paris looms ominously above us  directed by french filmmaker christian volckman  in his feature length debut   renaissance  draws significantly from other films in the science fiction genre  and the tech noir storyline isn t something we haven t seen before  but  from a technical standpoint  it is faultless   the year is   the city of paris is a crumbling metropolis filled with dark alleys and deserted footpaths  the recent installation of modern technology merely offering a thin mask to the pitiable degradation of the darkened buildings  the city s largest corporation  avalon  achieved wealth through offering citizens the promise of beauty and youth  and the company s research department is continually striving to invent greater means of eliminating the aging process  ilona tasuiev  voiced by romola garai in the english language version  which i watched    a brilliant young scientist  is mysteriously kidnapped on her return from work  and so it falls to legendary detective barth l my karas  daniel craig  to uncover her current whereabouts  possibly holding the key to the woman s disappearance is bislane  catherine mccormack  ilona s hardened elder sister  whose trustworthiness is in question  and jonas muller  ian holm  the dedicated medical doctor who adored ilona as his own daughter   the eerie  dimly lit city of paris is reminiscent of ridley scott s  blade runner   and some of the technology looks as though it might have been borrowed from tom cruise in  minority report    which was  coincidentally  also set in the year   however  despite this familiarity  volckman has created an exciting world for his characters to inhabit  blending classic film noir and science fiction  the result is an eye catching collage of harsh lighting and dark shadows  which  i should warn  occasionally becomes difficult on the viewer s eyes  the dialogue is a little banal at times  and the story  though engaging  doesn t offer anything strikingly original  except for the ending  which i thought was a bold twist on the usual formula  but  renaissance  is intended to work best as a visual treat  and that it succeeds in this regard cannot be denied
