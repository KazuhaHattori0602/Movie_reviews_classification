this show was great  it wasn t just for kids which i thought at first  it is for the whole family   the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son  he sadly passed away in season   i could believe it when i heard it   i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made  it must of be so hard for them to film this   you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes  i am   year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was   years too just like roy   season   and season   had great comedy in there also season   had some of my favorites such freaky friday  secrets   i still think the show was strong enough to go on  i was disappointed that it ended  it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends   it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday
