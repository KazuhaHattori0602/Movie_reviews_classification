a great idea    stories about   september    directors from different countries with different results  ken loach talking about an immigrant  as usual  is just brilliant  as usual  the frenchman does a very good job also  while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise  however  the israel film was a bit boring  and the mexican guy  well  he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant
