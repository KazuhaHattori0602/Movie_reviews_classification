   three main characters are important in this movie

 each of them is a complex individual  threatened with multiple motivations  and sunk into doubts and disappointments
 the two are desperate characters  financially and emotionally
  andy is selfish
 he feels that he has never had the love of his father
 he is the corrupting influence  turning his brother into an assailant  and his beautiful woman into an adulteress
  hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother s wishes
 his ex wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child support
  he longs to regain the confidence he once had with his father
   the third character is their weary and deplorable father charles hanson  albert finney  especially in the haunting climactic scenes
