this was a great movie  even though there was only about   people including myself there it was great  my friend and i laughed a lot  my mom even enjoyed it  there was two middle aged women there and a mid   year old there and they seemed to enjoy it  i love the part where corky and ned are like both liking nancy and stuff its cute lol  and when she gets her roadster and ned is there  yeah this was a great movie even thought people underestimated it lol  go see it i bet you ll enjoy it  i really enjoyed it and so did my friend    people were so tough on this movie and they hadn t even seen it  i bet next time they will give the movie and actresses a chance  they all did a great job in my opinion  but if you have young kids its still appropriate  i will probably take my   year old niece to watch it too
