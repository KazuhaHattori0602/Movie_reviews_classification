enormous fun for both adults and children  this film works on numerous levels  there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good  yet subtle  jokes for adults   glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella  `call me ella  de ville   after three years in dr  pavlov s behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur   even the puppy skin fur she had so intensely desired  she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits   but it wouldn t be a  dalmatian  movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification  and now she needs one extra puppy  hence   dalmatians  to complete her nefarious scheme this time round   ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `second chance  dog shelter  though he was in `titanic  and in last year s television version  as pip  of `great expectations  i didn t recognize him  well  he was  fifth officer lowe  in `titanic  and i didn t see `great expectations  so i am not terribly surprised   gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier pawn of cruella  he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen   and does it well  his  wicked witch of the west  homage is hilarious   tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella s not so evil henchman   he was also  alonzo  cruella s butler  in `  dalmatians  and you may also recognize him from all of the `black adder  brit coms  he plays his usual bumbling  good hearted  somewhat dim witted character to great effect   oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film  this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing   it is incredibly detailed  note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic  and worthy of such an over the top character  her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination   animation holds a special place in my heart   but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans  it can t be done  suffice it to say that `  dalmatians  is even better than the film version of `  dalmatians  that came out in   there is a lot to like here  from the sight gags  the dialogue  and the costumes to the casting   it is a good film for the whole family
