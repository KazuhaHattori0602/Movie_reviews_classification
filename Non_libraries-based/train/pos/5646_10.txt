recently when i was shopping  i saw the box set of americian gothic  and i thought  i remember that  i used to set my alarm to get back up   watch this when it was on ch   in   at  am  i was   i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird  no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck  with a b  no one ever was anyway    what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box set as when on tv  episodes in funny order  i kept thinking when does dr matt leave    they made it so confusing    however this is not the writers  producers or directors fault  its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same   just look at shows like carnivale and farscape they don t like originality in studios   to finish   if you ve not seen this and you call yourself a sci fi fantasy  horror  supernatural drama fan   you must  they even said the same in sfx when reviewing the box set
