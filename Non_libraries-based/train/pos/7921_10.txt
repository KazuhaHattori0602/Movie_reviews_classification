it  just funny  watch it    ok they want   lines so there  this is a spoof of  s s werewolf movies  lots of satire  some political  feels like an early clouseau movie  probably due to alan arkin  but with less slap stick  if you like the naked guns movies you ll like this too  once again less slapstick in this one    actually  the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo  unavoidable in a teen comedy  to really poignant socio political satire  the transformation of the moon high school from  s to  s is really funny  the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant  ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious  there are tons of  histarical  cracks starting from the  s cold war paranoia and the late  s inflation   anyway  just watch the movie if you get a chance
