  just before this  the references to hitchcock s  vertigo  and identity switching confusion are brilliant  this is a movie to be hashed out between thinking people  it not only holds up under repeated viewings  it demands them   twelve monkeys  is intelligent  provocative  bizarre  funny  and suspenseful stuff   the supporting cast is excellent  especially brad pitt stealing all of his scenes and showing great flexibility as jeffery goines  crazed and spoiled  but ever the survivor  and there is david morse as dr  peters  interesting how the movie simply leaves to the viewer his wicked motivation  and christopher plummer as dr  goines  but the biggest accolades belong to terry gilliam  surpassing here   just barely   his outstanding  brazil   lots of parallels  of course  especially the lonely combatant trying to escape his crumbling surroundings  lunacy within  lunacy without  every frame of this movie has his unique stamp and tone  the soundtrack is terrific  too   this is one of the great achievements of the  s  a true favorite of mine  and sure to hold up for a long time to come
