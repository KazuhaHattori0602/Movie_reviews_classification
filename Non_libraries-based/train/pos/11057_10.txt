i was   years old when this show was on tv  by far it was my favorite  the actors were very credible  alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous  i just order the dvd   episodes  they didn t have super powers  they just had superior human skills  strength  hearing  sight  the   actors were very good in their rolls  very believable  there was a good story in each episode  at the time  there were no special effects or explosions everywhere  so the script was suppose to be good  and the characters performs were great  there was no fancy stuff  like in other shows  they didn t try to make a joke every   minutes to make a light show  i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff
