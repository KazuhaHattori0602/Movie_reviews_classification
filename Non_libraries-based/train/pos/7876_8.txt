i did not like chandni bar from the same director   i did not watch his other movies  they came and went   but page  is nicely made  seems real  like satya from rgv did   the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie  in the midst of all the sickness  its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist  konkana sen  does  serious movie  not to be watched with children or expecting wives  page  of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported  how this page  is also a business prospect is shown in the movie  event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party   the western culture has crept into the high society of mumabi quite deeply  the movie shows it boldly  no holds barred   madhur bhandarkar starts a new journey from here
