i just recently watched this on the sundance channel  the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers  illustrious in their own country  to make short films  eleven of them  all in one film  concentrating on just one subject  september    from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film   the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september   which they fail to realize until later   the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the t v plays   the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of   but bombings in other places   the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september   and believes they must march for them   the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladin   the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day   the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks   there are other films that i can t remember at the moment but all of them are powerful  it will bring back your emotions from that day
