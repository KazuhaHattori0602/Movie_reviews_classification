michael caton jones s scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same name   the film opens in the scottish highlands  with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james graham s cattle  the scene then switches to a sword fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs  adorned shirts  soft colored coats  paleface make up and conventional gestures   macgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose  when he enters an ill advised trade agreement with montrose  he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montrose s evil doers  the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie  though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape  when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers  the action becomes well understood  ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade   liam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character  he is intelligent  fair and virile  he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community  he is a loving father  a passionate lover  and a noble husband  driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains  he d rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust    oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife  a proud peasant woman  brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat  lange s lines are filled with dignity and integrity   i will think on you dead  until my husband makes you so  and then i will think on you no more   john hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis  ruthless with money and tempered by the english court s fashion for foppery  he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service  honor  in his view  seems a quaint notion  he has two objectives  ruin the reputation of his rival  the duke of argyle  and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor  he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders  homes  to kill their people and their livestock   tim roth the perfect antithesis to the hero  is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer  he is a penniless british aristocrat  a nasty  hired sword  wonderfully evil  ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist  his name is archibald cunningham  he turns out to be a liar  a thief and a murderer  he dismisses himself as  but a bastard abroad  seeking his fortune and the favors of great men  and therefore can t care about anyone else   love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow  he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl   cunningham seems pathetic  he smiles foolishly  and utters words with affected refinement  but not terribly harmful until a muscular swordsman insults him  and we discover that he s a cool head and an expert with a sword  he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nomination   and while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn  andrew keir is montrose s rival  the powerful local aristocrat  the duke of argyll  one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family    set in  th century scotland  and with an atmospheric musical score   rob roy  is really a love story between a man and his wife  a recognizably human story  unjustly dwarfed by mel gibson s  braveheart  that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords
