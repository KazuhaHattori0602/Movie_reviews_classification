this is a warm  funny film  in much the same vein as the works of almodovar  sure it has a   year old boy sucking milk from breasts  but the style is so playful that i can t understand at all those readers who found it sick or perverted  but would i be willing to let my  year old son play the part  not so sure    spanish cinema is often quite sexual  but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink  i think that we if we northern european types had the same attitude  we d be much better off as a result   this liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious  fartman maurice  character  as his lover says to him   most people are embarrassed about farting  you turn it into an art form
