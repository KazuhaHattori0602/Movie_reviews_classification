  focused on this very criticism  that it wasn t a typical lynch film   lynch is struggling within the mold of a g rated story that isn t his own  brundage claims  with his protagonist alvin straight  quoting lines directly from confucious  he argues that the story is weak and the dialogue even worse  yet this is about the only criticism that many will read for the film  whilst it is true that it is not lynch in the sense of eraserhead  lost highway or mulholland drive   all films which i also adore  the straight story features a different side of lynch that is by no means terrible  if you are a lynch fan  it is most important to separate that side of lynch with this feature   the narrative is slow and thoughtful  which gives you a real sense of the protagonist s thoughts as he travels to his destination  alvin constantly is reminded about his past and his relationships with his wife  children and his brother  yet particularly significant is that there are no flashbacks  which only adds to the effect  which reminded me of my conversations with my grandparents  the conclusion arrives like watching a boat being carried down a slow meandering river and it is beautiful to watch  the natural landscapes of the us are accentuated and together with the beautiful soundtrack by angelo badalamenti  makes me yearn to go to america  the performances are also excellent with every actor believable in their roles and richard farnsworth is particularly excellent  his oscar nomination was greatly deserved and it was a shame that he didn t win  regardless  however it is probably the finest swan song for any actor    so whilst the straight story features none of lynch s complex narratives or trademark dialogue  the film is a fascinating character study about getting old and comes highly recommended
