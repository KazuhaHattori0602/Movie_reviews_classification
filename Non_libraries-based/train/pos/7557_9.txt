gender bender the limerick   a man or a woman  who knows   it turns out that  it  is both   sleeping in clay  then they all went away  in one of their ufos   gender bender is another great season   episode  i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what s gonna happen next  it is entirely original  the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights  i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does  i really like the atmosphere at the kindred s little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night  its very exciting  this is one of my favorite season   episodes in fact  i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles  many people see this as a non mythology related alien episode kind of like  the unnatural  or  space  but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related  maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone  huh  anyway i give the episode a   out of
