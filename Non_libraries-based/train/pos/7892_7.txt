freddy has gone from scary to funny in this  th installment in the nightmare series    it s been   years well actually   since this film takes place in  and freddy has killed every last kid on elm street except one john doe jacobb from part  even doe the film gives on hint who he is in which he uses to bring more children to come to elm street not only does freddy gets his wishes but he also gets his daughter back to elm street when she finds out what is happening she and other kids decide to kill freddy once and for all we also get to see some of freddy s eerie backgrounds    rachel talalay who has been contected to the nightmare series for a long time by now many people hate this film but i liked it it tried to bring out what freddy was doing with his wisecrackes comdey and makes the series more funny than scary so this film is really a comdey sore to speak it is not the wrost in the series part   still holds it
