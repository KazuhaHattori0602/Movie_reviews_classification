watching  ossessione  today   more than   decades later   is still a powerful experience  especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever  roughly from  ossessione  and de sica s  i bambini ci guardano  both   up to   years later with fellini  antonioni  pasolini  visconti makes an amazing directing d but  taking the  uncredited  plot of  the postman always rings twice  as a guide to the development of his own themes   it strikes us even today how ahead of its time  ossessione  was  shot in fascist italy during world war ii  think about it  it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters   and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn t help     ossessione  alarmingly reveals poverty ridden war time italy  far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist  telefoni bianchi  movies  but it s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness  with shirtless hunk gino  massimo girotti  who definitely precedes brando s kowalski in  a streetcar named desire  taking giovanna  clara calamai  a married woman  to bed just   minutes after they first meet  we watch calamai s unglamorous  matter of fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo  elio marcuzzo   a very appealing actor  his face not unlike pierre cl menti s  who was shot by the nazis in   at   years old in a few words  sex  lust  greed and poverty  as relentlessly as it had rarely  if ever  been shown before in italian cinema   all the copies of  ossessione  were destroyed soon after its opening   it was called scandalous and immoral  visconti managed to save a print  and when the film was re released after the war  most critics called it the front runner of the neo realist movement  preceding rossellini s  roma citt  aperta  and de sica s  sciusci  some other critics  perhaps more appropriately  saw  ossessione  as the italian counterpart to the  poetic realism  of french cinema  remember visconti had been renoir s assistant  especially marcel carn s  quai des brumes  and  le jour se l ve  and julien duvivier s  p p  le moko    while  ossessione  may be neo realistic in its visual language  the depiction of war time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs  poverty  child labor  prostitution  bums  swindlers etc  the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian  he was always more interested in tragic  passionate  obsessive  greedy characters  in social political sexual apartheid  in the decadence of the elites than in realistic   everyday  life  characters and themes  favored by desica and rossellini  in  ossessione  we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films  especially  senso   visconti s definitive departure from neo realist aesthetics  and  rocco e suoi fratelli even in his most  neo realist  film   la terra trema  he makes his fishermen rise from day to day characters to mythological figures    ossessione  is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches  analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again  from their first to their last opus  no matter if the scenery  background or time setting may change   visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are  well  obsessively recurrent   ossessione  is not to be missed  you ll surely be fascinated by this ground breaking  powerful film
