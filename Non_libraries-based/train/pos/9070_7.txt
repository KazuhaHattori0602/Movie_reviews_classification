it started out slow after an excellent animated intro  as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop  once the bet is on  though  the movie picks up the pace as it s a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by   pm  we had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son  bullies  helping others  mind over matter when you don t want to do something   of special note is the girl who played erica  erk  hallie kate eisenberg  the director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly  and when she is on screen she is captivating  she s one of those  hey  she looks familiar  faces  and then i remembered that she was the little girl that pepsi featured about   years ago  she was also in  paulie  that movie about the parrot who tries to find his way home   ms  eisenberg made many tv and movie appearances in   but then was not seen much for the next few years  she s now   and is growing up to be a beautiful woman  her smile really warms up the screen  if she can get some more good roles she could have as good a career  or better  than haley joel osment  another three named kid actor  but hopefully without some of the problems that osment has been in lately   anywhozitz  according to my   y o  son  who just finished reading the story  the film did not seem to follow the book all that well  but was entertaining none the less  the ending of the film seemed like a big setup for some sequels  how to eat boiled slugs  escargot kid s style  which might not be such a bad thing  it was nice to take the family to a movie and not have to worry about language  violence or sex scenes   one other good aspect of the movie was the respect fear engendered by the principal mr  burdock  boilerplate  movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffoons  while he has one particular goofy scene  he ruled the school with a firm hand  it was also nice to see andrea martin getting some work
