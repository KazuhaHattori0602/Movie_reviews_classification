although this show has been off the air since   after viewing a dvd set i borrowed at our library  i felt compelled to say a bit about it   i can remember when it was the only color show on television in the  s  and sometimes there would be a little  sunday night party  with friends to watch this on nbc on one of the few color televisions   i really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time  case in point  virginia city  nevada  which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the silver  got its name from a character named  old virginny  who  in the town s early days  stumbled out of a saloon  fell and broke his whiskey bottle   old virginny didn t want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid was seeping into the dirt he decided to christen the town  virginia town  the area became known as the comstock lode because another character  henry comstock  had the reputation of trying to jump everyone s claim and the area became known as the comstock lode   i just watched an early episode that dealt with these   subjects  other episodes dealt with mark twain s literary rise while a reporter for the territorial enterprise   it was wholesome  and frequently educational  family entertainment  as someone else remarked  each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right   rich scripts and characters    one thing it twisted the truth on was the proximity to virginia city and the ponderosa  in truth  to ride from the ponderosa  all of northern lake tahoe  one would have to ride his horse about   feet   meters  down the spooner summit to the high desert   feet  of the carson valley then another   miles to virginia city   needless to say the cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis  but every writer should have some leeway with the truth   how i miss that show  even today
