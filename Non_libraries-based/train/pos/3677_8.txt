thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently  thought i d missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest  paris  je t aime is a collection of   short films  about   mins each  by   directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris   one of my fave segments is  parc monceau  by alfonso cuarn  great expectations  harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban  which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte   the coen brothers   tuileries  starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious   juliette binoche and willem dafoe in  place des victoires  was haunting   for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress druggie in  quartier des enfants rouges  to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant   elijah wood as a vampire victim in  quartier de la madeleine  was pretty surreal  while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven s  pre lachaise   natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in  faubourg saint denis  but despite the many portrayals of young love  a more mature execution by gena rowlands in  quartier latin  was equally aww inducing   this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of   there are also a number of memorable quotes  one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days   in pretending to be a man in love  he became a man in love
