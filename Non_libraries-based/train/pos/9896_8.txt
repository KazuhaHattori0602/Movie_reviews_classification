i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months  i was actually surprised at how good it was   the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty  they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly burned   a few years later  the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party  though  not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party   later through the film  the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible  i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well   at the end of the film  you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened  but  marty is in the hospital with severe burns  although the murders didn t happen  the burns and the pranks apparently did happen   the acting is terrible but that is fine   i love the story  i really sympathize with marty  it s like tamara   the bullies get what s coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge   i would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for  s slashers   i give this movie   stars out of   good cheesy slasher
