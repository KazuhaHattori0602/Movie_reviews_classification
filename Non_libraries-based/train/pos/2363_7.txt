this adaptation of m r  james s short story  a view from a hill  was first shown on british television in   on the little watched digital channel bbc   i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc   and decided to give it a go  remembering the bbc s successful  s adaptations of other m r  james stories including  whistle and i ll come to you my lad  and  the signalman  though not in the same class as these masterpieces   a view from a hill  is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama   a historian arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of antique artifacts  whilst out in the countryside  he sees an abbey that has been in ruins for hundreds of years  but what does this have in connection with an old pair of binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominously named gallows hill  and what do the brusque country squire and his servant know about the situation  whilst not scary in any way  i enjoyed this little production  and had the running time been longer than   minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation  as it is  it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome   i give it   out of
