i was given the opportunity to see this   film in a magnificently restored theater that was once part of the extensive paramount chain of vaudeville houses  this paramount has a  mighty wurlitzer  organ   also magnificently restored   that was used to accompany the silent films of the day   we were fortunate enough to have dennis james  a key figure in the international revival of silent films at the mighty wurlitzer playing appropriate music and thematic compositions fitting to the action on the film  the print was a nearly perfect digital copy of the rapidly decaying nitrate negative and the entire experience was a once in a lifetime chance to see a silent film as it was meant to be seen   this was greta garbo s first american film  she was only   years old but already had   swedish films in her repertoire   it is somewhat ironic that this is a silent film about an opera star  even though the mighty wurlitzer added immensely to the mise en scene  it was necessary to leave much to the imagination   modern audiences  for the most part  do not understand silent films
 acting was different then  with expansive gestures and broad facial expressions  therefore audiences laugh at inappropriate times   the acting is seen as  hammy  and over done   but it was simply the style of the period   garbo  with all her subtlety  did much to usher in the new age of acting  she could say more with a half closed eye and volumes could be read into a downward glance or a simple shrug  she exemplifies the truism that `a picture is worth a thousand words   even though this is garbo s first american film it is pretty obvious the studio knew what they had on their hands  this was mgm filmmaking at its best  the sets and costumes were magnificent  the special effects   which by today s standards are pretty feeble   were still electrifying and amazing   the script by vicente blasco ibanez  from the novel by entre naranjos  would seem to be tailor made for garbo  it showcases her strengths  magnifies her assets and there is no pesky language problem to deal with  a swedish actress can play a spanish temptress with no suspension of disbelief on our part   her co star was mgm s answer to rudolph valentino  ricardo cortez  he does an admirable job and did something that few romantic stars of the day ever would have done in a film  allow himself to look unnactractive  appear foolish and to grow old ungracefully   there are some fairly good character parts that are more than adequately acted   especially when you consider the powerhouse that was garbo  notable among them are lucien littlefield as  cupido  and martha mattox as  do a bernarda brull   this is when the extraordinary cinematographer  william h  daniels  met garbo   they went on to make   films together   he was the cinematographer on   films and his career spanned five decades  he was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker by which she became known  the divine garbo  without his magnificent abilities she would not have been the success that she was   seeing this film is an all too rare opportunity  if you ever have the chance  do not miss it
