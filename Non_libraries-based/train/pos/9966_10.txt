i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in   it is the worst thing i ve ever seen  so bad in fact  that by sheer freakiness  this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed    whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten  i mean  really  the devil vs  santa  visions of hell  creepy laughing wind up reindeer  forced child labor with racial stereotypes  it ain t sesame street  that s for sure as crow exclaims during the mst k showing   this is good ol  fashioned nightmare fuel    there s plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology  merlin  presumably the arthurian merlin  hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds  i e  heaven  santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to  mr  stork  for children who ask for siblings  there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars    my best friend and i have watch it every year since   and we subject anybody we can hold down for   hours to watch it with us
