i remember this game  it was always sitting on the shelves alone  until one day i decided to try something new for a change  and got this game  i stared in awe at it  since it was the first ever game for the ps  that i owned that had   discs  when i played it  i couldn t put the controller down  seriously   the storyline of this game is so good and twisted  it s almost as good as the final fantasy vii storyline  and that is hard to accomplish  when you play the game  you get so involved with the characters it s unbelievable that it s only a ps  game  as it feels like a movie  and i believe it should be made into a movie   too bad this game is a very unheard of game and barely no one has played or liked it  as it is one of those games that is sitting on the ends of the shelves  with a   off sign sitting on it  trying to sell  well i am one of those people who always look at those on the ends  and try them out and most of them turn out to be really good  heck  that is how i got into final fantasy vii  looking in a catalog  and finding it  but this is different than final fantasy   legend of dragoon  is the only game or rpg that is better than most square enix games  surprisingly  i wouldn t be surprised if it was made by square enix but it s not  hardly any games i play are better than the final fantasy series  or the dragon quest series  but this one is  but what really bugs me is why it is very little known and is not praised  which it should be   graphics are pretty good for a ps  game  but what can you expect from it  it s ps  man  made in   story i have already mentioned is amazing  almost beats vii  characters are a amazing  you get involved so much with them  and their actions   a definite   out of   definitely deserved more praise  and a very well done rpg by a company other than square enix
