but i want to say i cannot agree more with moira   what a wonderful film   i was thinking about it just this morning  wanting to give advice to some dopey sod who d lost money on his debit card through fraud  and wanted to say  keep thy money in thine pocket  and realised i was talking like james mason   even tho he didn t say those words  i still think he would  i ve never forgotten  are ye carrying  in his reconciliation with his son  hywel bennet   always have money in thine pocket  good advice   not enough kids have fathers with such unforgiving but well meant attitudes any more  or any father at all   it would be a good thing for us to reinstate  thee   thy  and  thine  in our language to show we care  it is only the same as  tutoyer  in french or  du  in german   addendum  i just realised that a lot of my remarks were about james mason in the family way   i think it s because i mixed up susan george with hayley mills  well  easy mistake   i stand by the comments tho   and spring and port wine is so very similar to the family way   when you took a girlfriend to the pictures in those days  you really had something to say and talk about afterwards  something that affected your knowledge of the world and your personal development   theatrical experiences are almost real  and they are important in helping young people to grow up   it doesn t happen now  i think  that teenagers can just go to the pics like we did
