  was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers  their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection   mark sandrich s  follow the fleet  this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker  a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront caf  where sherry martin  rogers  is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone s ear  yep  you guessed it   they re hot for each other once again  only this time sherry s spinster sister  connie  harriet hillard  threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake s robust seafaring buddy  bilge smith  randolph scott  a sort of use  em up and toss  em out kind of guy  thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general  irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic  classy score  including standards  let yourself go   i m putting all my eggs in one basket  and  let s face the music and dance  the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger    the transfer on  follow the fleet  is a tad weaker  the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it s a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles  grain is still present  so are age related artifacts  once you ve settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality  the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage  the audio is mono but very nicely balanced  extras include a featurette  theatrical trailer and short subject  but oddly   no audio commentary  considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video
