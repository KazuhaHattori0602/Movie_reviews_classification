i ll keep it short and brief  the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius  the actors are just perfect for the roles they play  cj s character is legendary  and they have so much chemistry on screen which makes it what it is  a very successful comedy   when i saw first saw the new episodes which is probably going back just over   months  i wondered what had happened to paul  i was gutted to find out that he had died when i browsed google  he was so funny and played his character to perfection  an over protective dad  who likes to keep his daughters out of the limelight and away from boys   the comedy  i think  has gone from strength to strength  even without paul in it   plus  i think most people would enjoy this watching it
