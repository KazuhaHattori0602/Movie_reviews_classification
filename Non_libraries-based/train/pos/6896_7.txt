this is the last of four swashbucklers from france i ve scheduled for viewing during this christmas season  the others  in order of viewing  were the uninspired the black tulip   from the same director as this one but not nearly as good  the surprisingly effective lady oscar   which had originated as a japanese manga  and the splendid cartouche   actually  i had watched this one not too long ago on late night italian tv and recall not being especially bowled over by it  so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around  also bearing in mind the baffling lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from criterion   incidentally  fanfan la tulipe has quite a bit in common with the afore mentioned cartouche  not just cast and crew members  producers georges dancigers and alexandre mnouchkine  cinematographer christian matras  actor noel roquevert  but plot wise as well   in fact  the hero is a womanizing soldier  jean paul belmondo s cartouche had also had a brief military spell  who s loved by a fiery girl  in this case  gypsy gina lollobrigida  while he s himself obsessed by an impossible love  here  it s none other than the king s daughter  as in the later film  too  fanfan  an ideally cast gerard philipe who  ironically  is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within   years  time  is flanked by two fun loving yet cowardly men  one of them is actually his superior officer and the heroine s own father  and opposed by an unscrupulous figure within his own ranks  the ageing roquevert  with whom the hero eventually engages in a rooftop duel since he too has amorous designs on the gypsy girl  for the record  lollobrigida will rejoin philippe in her next film  rene clair s delightful romantic fantasy les belles de nuit    fanfan proved to be a big box office hit on its home ground and even copped a surprising  but well deserved  best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris   detective story   othello  umberto d  and viva zapata  in fact  its popularity ensured its re release in a computer colored version  presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn t touch a black and white product with a ten foot pole  and the criterion dvd itself contains a sample from this variant  being obviously a foreign language title  there s also the dubious choice of an english dubbed soundtrack but  even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering  when all is said and done  there s simply no substitute for the original    fanfan la tulipe  a nickname given the hero by a young genevieve page as the celebrated madame de pompadour  contains about as much comedy as  the expected  action and romance  while some may find this overwhelming  i don t agree myself as i enjoyed the sharply satirical narration and  on the whole  this combination is comparable with jerzy skolimowski s equally droll the adventures of gerard   that said  the swordfights here are remarkably forceful for an essentially lighthearted enterprise  particularly a scuffle in the woods and the ambush at a convent  and the film itself rather adult at times  with numerous allusions to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout  when viewed back to back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now  the climax  then is quite ingenious  the enemy forces  who  amusingly  are made to speak in speeded up gibberish  are depleted by our heroic trio alone  much to the king s amazement who  as portrayed by marcel herrand   best known for his role of leader of the parisian underworld in marcel carne s children of paradise     is himself something of a lecher   p s  an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian jaque s promising champagne for savages   for months now but  despite programming it three times already  with a tentative fourth one slated for next week  they have yet to show it  even so  i do have three more films of his in my unwatched vhs pile  equally culled from late night italian tv screenings  the three hour epic la chartreuse de parme   also starring gerard philippe  the second twin   and the legend of frenchie king   with brigitte bardot and claudia cardinale
