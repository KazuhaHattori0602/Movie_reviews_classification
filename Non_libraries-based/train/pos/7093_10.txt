with  twelve monkeys  you need to pay attention  but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate  i know i did  the story is interesting and deals with time traveling  a virus killed a lot of people back in   and a guy named cole  bruce willis  is send back to   and   to find a cure for the virus  in   he is arrested and put in a mental hospital  there he meets jeffrey goines  brad pitt  who probably has something to do with the virus  he also meets psychiatrist dr  kathryn railly  madeleine stowe  who doesn t believe him in   when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re appears in   kathryn starts believing cole s stories   the movie constantly plays with time  cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in   it is picked up in the future and  they  send someone  for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call  things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention  you could ask some questions but since you can t have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie    twelve monkeys  works as sci fi  with some great images and a dark atmosphere  and it works as a thriller  you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie  may be it has some flaws in the story  but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling  you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy  that was the easy part for me
