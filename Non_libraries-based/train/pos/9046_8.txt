i first saw jake gyllenhaal in jarhead   a little while back and  since then  i ve been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen  like clive owen  he has an intensity  and he even resembles owen somewhat  that just oozes from the screen  i feel sure that  if he lands some meaty roles  he ll crack an oscar one day   that s not to denigrate this film at all   it s a fine story  with very believable people  well  it s based upon the author s early shenanigans with rocketry  a great cast   chris cooper is always good  and laura dern is always on my watch list   with the appropriate mix of humor  pathos  excitement and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping   but  this film had a very special significance for me  in   i was the same age as homer hickham  like him  i looked up at the night stars to watch sputnik as it scudded across the blackness  like homer also  i experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel  and like homer  i also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster  what fun it was   i didn t achieve his great  metaphorical and physical  heights though  but  that s what you find out when you see this movie   sure  it s a basic family movie  but that s a dying breed these days  it seems  take the time to see it  with the kids  you ll all have a lot of good laughs
