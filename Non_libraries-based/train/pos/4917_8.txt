 panic in the streets   owes more to british noir that its american counterparts  like reed s  the third man   and dassin s  night and the city   director elia kazan chose to film largely on location  capturing the fresh and vibrant decadence of the new orleans slums  in a decision borrowed from the masters of italian neorealism  he also hired many non professional actors for minor roles  lending an air of authenticity to the cityscape  however  any further comparisons with neorealism would be misguided  for  panic in the streets  is pure melodrama  of the best kind  a murdered illegal immigrant  fished out of the bay  is found to be infected with pneumonic plague  a deadly air borne mutation of bubonic plague  which is transmitted from human to human and  untreated  has a mortality rate that approaches   clinton reed  richard widmark  an officer with the u s  public health service  convinces the doubtful police chief  paul douglas  to undertake a city wide manhunt for the men responsible for the homicide  lest they also be infected with the illness   in my younger years  i found wolfgang petersen s  outbreak   to be among the most horrifying movies i d ever seen  that thriller  which owes plenty to  panic in the streets   working title   outbreak  terrified me so efficiently because it depicted the ebola virus as both an invisible and invincible killer   how does one defend themselves against such a thing  kazan s film is the first  that i know of  to approach the subject of biological epidemics  though it has difficulty ascribing visual recognition to an enemy that is basically undetectable to the human eye  it instead uses jack palance as a human personification of the plague  despite his venturing out among the filthy dregs of human society  you never get the sense that clinton reed is placing his own life at risk  some viewers have noted that reed never inoculated himself against the plague  though i think it s safe to assume that he did so at the same time as the morgue staff  nevertheless  there s still a strong sense of urgency in the hunt for the infected man s killers  underground street rats who pollute the sewers with their misdeeds   in medieval times  when the black death  now widely believed to have been bubonic plague  swept across the civilised world  killing a third of europe s population  many identified the destruction as being the work of the devil  jack palance s character  blackie  serves effectively as satan in human form  the angular jawed thug can occasionally be charming and charismatic  but is always liable to explode into fits of violence  his two hoodlums  played by guy thomajan and zero mostel  through terror more than anything else  are constantly grovelling at his feet  when one lackey falls ill with fever  blackie deduces that the man s immigrant cousin must have  brought something in with him   the irony of his conclusion not passing unnoticed  and so attempts to ascertain what this presumably valuable object must be  he cradles the dying poldi in his arms  a grotesque display of faux affection that is both pathetic and unsettling  blackie satan is finally stopped   not by the authorities  but by the burden of his own infection evil   as he attempts to board a cargo ship  the primary vessel by which the plague spread across europe
