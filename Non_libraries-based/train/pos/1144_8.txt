way back in   the british made a comedy called simon and laura  with peter finch and the brilliant kay kendall  to this day  it stands as one of the finest examples of british comedy and  more particularly  about how television sitcoms become so popular  it was  and is  an excellent example also of self referential cinema   so also soapdish  a film i d never heard about until a few nights ago when i caught it on late tv  i was a bit dubious at first simply because comedy is so difficult to do well  as you know   however  i was pleasantly surprised and delighted to watch a very clever satire about daytime american tv  in fact  it s been a while since i laughed so heartily  so  if you like satire  i d recommend you see it   the main actors   sally field  kevin kline  robert downey and cathy moriarty   quite simply do an excellent job  revealing just how bitchy and shallow the business of acting is  as i watched it  i kept thinking to myself  just how much of this bitchiness carries over into real life  that is  if actors ever do have a real life  as you probably know  peter sellers  for example  was notorious for hiding his true persona behind a multitude of characters  so that nobody really knew the real person  so  as i watched sally field playing celeste talbot playing maggie  i thought again about that earlier british film with kay kendall playing laura playing a character in a tv sitcom opposite peter finch   is it any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns  and that feeling was crystallized when celeste finally confronts her daughter  lori  played by elizabeth shue  and  in an emotional moment  repeats the fictional lines she d used  on a prior episode of her daytime soap  when confronting her fictional daughter in that show  are you confused  well  it s not all like that  but the dialog is stunning for originality  comedy  bitchiness  anger  depravity  duplicity  and even love   the story  well  there are many stories in this film  all interwoven  and which all come together at the end  of course   but not like a robert altman film  okay  and not all of them are resolved finally  life s not like that anyway  right  the pace is almost frenetic  and you really do have to watch and listen carefully to catch all the sight gags and subtle jokes  spend the   minutes from your life and watch it  you won t regret the time usage   the rest of the cast all perform well  although i ve never taken much to whoopi goldberg  perhaps the funniest exchanges are between robert downey and cathy moriarty and  for my money  the latter steals so many scenes from others  she gets my vote as the outstanding player  i kid you not  she gives the term bitch an entirely new face
