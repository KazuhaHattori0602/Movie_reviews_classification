i loved this movie for two reasons    jeff combs is absolutely wonderful in it  plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt   and is absolutely adorable    the movie helped to inspire a role playing game i thoroughly enjoy  mage  the awakening  i ve shown it at various larp after parties  and it s always a big hit   d d love and jeff squeeing aside  it s not exactly a masterpiece  but it s well done and thoroughly enjoyable  the plot is fast moving and engaging in its simplicity  the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget  and the script  while nothing stellar  was not too badly done  and cheesy in all the right places  a good way to spend an evening
