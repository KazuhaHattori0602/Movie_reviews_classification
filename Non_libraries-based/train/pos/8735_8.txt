such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar s a bug s life  we re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film  but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation  for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer   when it s in the right hands that is   a bug s life is a warm reminder  we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling  and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions   it is only pixar s second animated feature  the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in   with their landmark movie toy story  it was a movie which defied convention  re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence  now  they return with their sophomore effort which  to be honest  draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film   after all  it s a film about ants  well  all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug s life  but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film  as humans are the focal point in dramas  romances and so on  how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie  let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film  surely they jest  however  we forget that in toy story  a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest  most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted  the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat  and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you ll probably ever encounter   not only are they all entirely amiable and likable   there isn t an unpleasant character in sight  even the villains are riveting characters   but they re colourful  they re eclectic  and they re idiosyncratic  and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term  only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug s life from the beginning  we shall start with our main character  and our hero  his name is flik  david foley  and his character is rather generic to say the least  out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush  beautiful ant island  he is the one considered the  black sheep  of the clan  as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season s harvest with his antics   the problem arises in the fact that the ants  harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper  kevin spacey  who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants  when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone  they go insane  for lack of a better term  hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack s hands  however  it s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil  the cogs and clockwork in flik s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame  and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers   if you think about it  a bug s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line s of akira kurosawa s classic seven samurai  or the american remake the magnificent seven  in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies   one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city  finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil  in a bug s life  the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl   much amusement comes out of these scenes  and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs  among them are an erudite stick insect  david hyde pierce  a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug  dennis hopper  it s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen  as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen  as is the entire movie collectively   as i ve said  much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another  which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines  wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie  what makes a bug s life even better is that the film isn t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be  although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film   the clich d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we d like  however  it s easy to ignore this fault  and it s incredulously easy to enjoy this film   although a bug s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor  this is still a superb movie  and the start of something promising here  pixar have proved that they re not just a one hit wonder  but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood  they raise the bar endlessly  and when someone always manages to top their standards  it s only always by themselves  what more is there to say about a bug s life other than  see it  it s not quite the best which we ve seen from the folks at emeryville  california  but this beats out the lot of its year   and i ll be damned if this isn t the best animated feature of
