i m intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards  or sympathy for  sinatra in the other reviews here  i ve read elsewhere that sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for  not  being cast as sky masterson   ok  so who wouldn t want to be cast as sky masterson    it s a great part  the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet  in which he must take salvation army sargeant sarah brown on a date to cuba  or lose  it s not the money   it s the pride  but he and she meet their match  meanwhile nathan detroit must juggle his long suffering fianc e adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it doesn t alienate his fianc e forever first   the film started life as a series of short stories by damon runyon  that s his unique dialogue you hear  and those are his great character names  and that s his horse racing nightclub late night gambling world  then it became a musical  and you can t help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage  the camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably   and not pleasingly   flat and childlike  fortunately the music is so great  i don t care that much   my absolute favourite thing about this film  though  is the singing and acting of the two non singers  brando  as sky  and jean simmons  as sargeant sarah brown  of course  putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music  but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead  what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto  acting ability  and pathos  pathos  pathos  you re with sky as he argues with sarah against reason  steadiness  pipes and safety  you enjoy sarah s loosening up under the influence of cuban  milk  you feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home  as sky rightly says  it s  chemistry  pro singers   be they broadway belters or smooth crooners   can t necessarily be relied on to make this happen   and they certainly didn t  i read somewhere that brando criticised sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of nathan detroit  sinatra in turn was infuriated by brando s four take acting method  as a brando fan  does it show  i m bound to take the other side  but i can t imagine that this film would have been the much adored classic it is today if brando and simmons hadn t been in it with their wonderful chemistry  brando s unpredictability  simmons  face  all pink cheeks and brown hair  drunk and ashamed in a cuban bar  beautiful  i ll always want a copy of this film lying around in case i need to feel good again  you ll forgive me if give some of the nathan  sleep talking parts the   brush off though  won t you  you won t  oh  be quiet and have some more of mindy s cheesecake
