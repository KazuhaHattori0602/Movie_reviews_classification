a very strong movie  bruce is good and brad also   as i think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list bruce remembered   that means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job   well  novikov property seems to me work in this movie  however  i do believe in back to the future theory of worlds  multiplicity   so bruce could save the world  but not his world   in the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself   and i do believe there is no problem in that  here i disagree with dr  brown from back   but the story pf   monkeys has its own beauty  inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor   his girlfriend was just lost   a sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future  the bullet   well it might be some mistake  some falsification   well i like this movie   has to buy a dvd   best
