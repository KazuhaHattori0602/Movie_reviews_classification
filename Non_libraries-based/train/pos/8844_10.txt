well  he can t seem to perform for  his flat belly days long gone  younger  sweet  slightly dim witted younger brother  hank  ethan hawke  with a few dinero problems of his own  behind in child support payments for his daughter  in debt to friends and relatives  not exactly wowing them in the work of work  etc   sydney lumet  in this performance at the age of     directs and gets it   percent right  which is hard to do in a thriller  i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes  the improbabilities  the cheesy scenes  and the hurry up ending  here lumet makes a thriller like it s a work of art  every detail is perfect  the acting is superb  the plot has no holes  the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself   hoffman of course is excellent  when you don t have marquee  leading man presence  you have to get by on talent  workmanship and pure concentration  ethan hawke  who is no stranger to the sweet  little guy role  adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don t know whether to pity him or trash him  albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age  and marisa tomei  who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity  manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy s two timing wife   but who could blame her  it s almost a movie reviewer s sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars  but if you study this film  as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do  you will notice the kind of excessive  according to most hollywood producers  attention to detail that makes for real art the sort of thing that only great artists can do  and indeed cannot help but do   by the way  i think there were twenty producers on this film well  maybe a dozen  check the credits  all i can say in summation is  way to go sydney lumet  author of a slew of excellent films  and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced age kudos  may we all do half so well   okay  the   percent  it was unlikely that the father  albert finney  could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail  this is minor  and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip  also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end  we can guess and guess  perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor  perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out  and he just said   leave it like that  it really doesn t matter  and i think it doesn t  what happens to hank is not going to be good  he isn t the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life  he is the kind of guy who gets a  light  sentence of   to   and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn t really a man when he should have been   see this for sidney lumet  one of hollywood s best  director of the pawnbroker   the group   serpico   dog day afternoon   network   and many more
