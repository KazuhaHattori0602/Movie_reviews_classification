kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode  they intend to evacuate the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr  atoz who operates some sort of high tech library  despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone s whereabouts  atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly  make a selection while there is still time  they have no idea what he s talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet s past  then  while a disk is in the viewer  kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis xiv  the  s  when mccoy and spock follow  a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell  all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository   while kirk s visit is pretty short and not all that exciting  spock and mccoy s is much more eventful  as spock falls head over heels for mariette hartley who was sent to this awful place as a punishment  the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very atypical of the normally logical guy   spock s departure from the norm  the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode one well worth seeing   fyi ian wolfe  the excellent character actor  played mr  atoz  i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the  s and  s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from   interestingly enough  despite looking ancient  he lived on another   years dying at over   years of age
