when i first saw this film  in london  in   i was bowled over  i had never seen a film like this before  it had a strange  hypnotic effect  quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact   i believe that odile versios   marina vlady are sisters  if not twins  certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer   if this has been converted to dvd   in region   format   and in the original french language  i would love to hear about it   where it can be purchased
