firstly  i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors  anything that has a rating below   is clearly utter nonsense   creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects  the actors are highly believable  the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing    there is much mystique in this film  many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels  how was  craig  created and what happened to him   a fantastic film with a large chill factor  a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like   days later  the bunker  dog soldiers and deathwatch   look forward to more of these fantastic films
