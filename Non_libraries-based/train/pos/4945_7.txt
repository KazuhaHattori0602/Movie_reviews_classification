it s a difficult movie to classify   items or less  generally  i don t care about defining genres  but there s something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category  in order to transmit  even with only one word  your feelings about it  i completely recommend this film to anyone and  if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life  you ll want to do the same as soon as you ve finished watching it    i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful admitting it s not perfect but it doesn t do anything wrong  i don t want to sound like i contradict myself  but i believe writer director brad silberling knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script  i m sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection  a product that would be as simple  appealing and uncompromising as its title  well  he s done it    silberling  director of long  complex  dramatic movies like  city of angels  and  moonlight mile  proves with   items or less  which closes in at just   minutes  the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it  to put an actor  morgan freeman  in front of a woman  paz vega  in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what silberling proposes here    i can t tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn t be underestimated  because here everyone s exposed  the camera focuses directly on the two main characters  who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that s not endless only because life is life  and let me express how praise how well silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches  in less time  not only in movie duration time  but in the single day that the movie develops its events  and in a smaller place  the kind of connection between two characters that sofia coppola generated in  lost in translation   that movie  set in tokyo  also encountered an actor and a woman  and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives  it s in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of   items or less  and  just as in coppola s movie  the naturalness of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don t seem forced or included in the picture to  buy time    in this aspect  the collaboration of silberling and his director of photography phedon papamichael  the man who shot the beautiful sceneries in  sideways  and focused on every emotion in  patch adams  delights us here with visual passages of true natural beauty    but the ultimate beauty of   items or less  can be found in its cast  by avy kaufman  in its two protagonists  they are the ones who transmit this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can t specify  we feel their connection and we can tell they re having fun and that they may even be improvising stuff  academy award winner morgan freeman  also an executive producer of the film  simply stands there and confirms the status he has today in the movie industry  and one that s well deserved  a quiet man  filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh  and the beautiful paz vega  well  i said she was great in  spanglish 
here she proves she s the real deal  and hollywood s not small for her
