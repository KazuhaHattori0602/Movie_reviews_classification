 excellent   good   fair   poor  `go ahead  make my day    the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself  who was rumored of directing most of magnum force  and he brings back the violent society from the first two films  however  the film still lacks impact and believability  this film was released in the early ` s  the time of regan and the young republicans  the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn t appeal to this time frame  this plot would have been better for the enforcer  which actually would have made it a good movie  what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle    rating    stars
