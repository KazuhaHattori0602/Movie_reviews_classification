red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night  intense acting  great villain and unexpected action   some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short   min s and   of the movie is on a plane and just talking  don t worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog   a pg  movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven  but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller   this movies strongest point is its cast  this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills  if they didn t have those actors the film would have been lost and boring  we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers  cillian murphy from batman begins and   days later  rounding off this cast is brian cox from x men    the pacing in this film was great  just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you  luckily this isn t a long movie and doesn t feel like it either  much better then the other flight movie flight plan   here is my flight plan comment      i recommend  not too long and not too shabby
