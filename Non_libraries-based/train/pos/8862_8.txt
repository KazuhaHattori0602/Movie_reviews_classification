sydney lumet hasn t had a box office hit in   years and yet at   has managed to churn out a tight  well cast  suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground  new york city   how he got insurance  let alone the budget after all those flops  is a mystery also  the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene   two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents  the only victim is going to be the insurance company  the robbery goes awry and two people die  most of the film is concerned with the aftermath  the action is non linear and seen from the main character s differing points of view  but it is not difficult to follow  what is not so easy to work out is the back story   how did the brothers get into such a mess  there are clues   the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers  favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father  and vice versa  but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin using murdering embezzler   as the scheming older brother  a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film  but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied  inadequate younger brother  albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that  marisa tomei as the older brother s cheating wife at the age of   puts in the sexiest performance i ve seen in many a year  the film literally starts with a bang  but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly   i don t know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet s great  s film  dog day afternoon  it is based on fact   it s too silly to be untrue  lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them  some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys  this isn t a classic of either sort   it s a well crafted piece of downbeat entertainment  it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one  but still wondering as to how they got that way  we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys   there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant  well  like tolstoy  we have to conclude that  each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
