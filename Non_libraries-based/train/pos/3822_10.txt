lee chang dong s exceptional  secret sunshine  is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year  it is an instantly sobering  brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought  yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes  through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small town dynamics  lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism    secret sunshine  remains an immensely compelling  fluid work throughout its  minute runtime  its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations  remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness  adapted from a short story  lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life  last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent  oasis  understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed  lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow s sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience   do yeon jeon s  you are my sunshine  best actress accolade at cannes in   is well deserved  her performance as the widow shin ae remains an unrelenting enigma  as a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control  the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film s turbulent nature  with jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another  there s a tremulous sense of collapse that the film  to its credit  never approaches  instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts  she becomes the centre of the film s universe as well as ours  filmed in glorious hand held cinemascope  the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from shin ae through times of happiness  guilt and remorse   lee captures the details of life in the small  suspicious town of miryang   the awkwardness of communal situations  its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas  shin ae s interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends  especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son  jun  seon jung yeop  the one recurring acquaintance is jong chan  song kang ho  a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to miryang in the film s enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight  song has situated himself as a comedic anti hero in south korea s biggest films but his nuanced  low key delivery here purports the director s thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary   if pain is ephemeral  then grief can never truly dissipate  and lee finds complexity in subsistence  when shin ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak  she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical christianity as a foil to her sorrow  but lee knows better than that when he understands that religion  in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery  is never a simple solution  but lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others  the scenes in its latter half which deal with religion doesn t allow itself to become aggressively scornful  which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters   lee s first film since his call to office as his country s minister of culture and tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering  in a film so artless and genuine  it arduously reveals that there s nothing as simple as emotional catharsis  just the suppression and abatement of agony   secret sunshine  leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence  and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith
