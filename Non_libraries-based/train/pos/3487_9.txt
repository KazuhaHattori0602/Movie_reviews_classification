wrestlemania   is not often looked as one of the great wrestlemania s but i would personally put it  in my top   if not the top   it has so many great things  and it truly signified the birth of the attitude era  which was wwe s best era  in my opinion  hbk has the heart of a lion  and him putting over austin like he did  on his way out  was pure class on his part  it has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see  and it has j r and the king at their announcing best    matches       team battle royal loud pop for l o d s return  i m not a fan of battle royal s  and this is yet another average one  very predictable  even when you  st see it  it s obvious l o d would win  looking at sunny for   or so minutes though  definitely helps       wwf light heavyweight championship  taka michinoku c  vs aguila   taka gets a surprising pop  with his entrance  fast  high flying  and very exciting  if these two had more time  they would have surely tore the roof off  with their stuff  taka wins with the michinoku driver          wwf european championship   triple h c  vs owen hart stipulation here  is chyna is handcuffed to slaughter  nice pop for owen  mixed reaction for trips  a really  really underrated match  that ranks among one of my favorites for wrestlemania  actually  the two mixed together very well  and owen can go with anybody  trips wins  with chyna interference      mixed tag match  marc mero sable vs goldust luna  defining pop for sable  unheard of that time  for woman  sable actually looks hot  and the crowd is just eating her up  constant sable chants  and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring  not bad for a mixed tag match  it had entertaining antics  and passed the time well  sable s team wins  when sable hits the tko          wwf intercontinental championship  ken shamrock vs the rock c  before i review the match  i d like to note the rock showed off his immense potential  with his interview with jennifer flowers  before his match  nice pop for shamrock  big time heat for the rock  too disappointingly short  and i thought the ending was kinda stupid  though shamrock s snapping antics were awesome to see  and the crowd went nuts for it  rock keeps the title  when the ref reverses the decision      dumpster match  for the wwf tag team championship  catcus jack terry funk vs the new age outlaws  the outlaws are not as over  as they were gonna be at this time  crowd is actually somewhat dead for this  but i thought it had some great hardcore bits  with some sick looking bumps  cactus and terry win the titles in the end      the undertaker vs kane  big time ovation  for the undertaker  much better than there outing at wrestlemania   and for a big man vs big man match  this was really good  it was a great all out brawl  with the undertaker taking a sick looking bump  through the table  wwe was smart  by making kane looking strong  even through defeat  after   tombstone kick out s  taker finally puts him away  with a  rd one          wwf championship    special guest enforcer  mike tyson   hbk c  vs steve austin  big heat for tyson  crowd goes ape sh t for austin  definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard  mixed reaction  for hbk  this is truly a special match up  one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history  you can tell when j r is even out of breath  hbk gives it his all  in what was supposed to be his last match  and austin has rarely been better  the animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing  and it s as exciting as it gets  austin wins with the stunner  with tyson joining   by knocking out michaels  austin s celebratory victory  is a wonder to behold  with one of the nosiest crowd s you will ever see  king said it right  they were going nuts      bottom line  wrestlemania   is one of the greatest for real  it has everything you want in a wrestlemania  and truly kick started the attitude era  this is very special to me  because it was the  st wrestlemania i ever saw  back in    the austin era  has begun
