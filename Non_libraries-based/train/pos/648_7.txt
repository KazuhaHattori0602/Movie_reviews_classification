i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site  i would have to say it was worth the effort  however  you should take heed that this film will go on for   minutes  if you don t have the staying power  get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights   now to the film  what i say will contain  spoilers  and if you don t mind  here goes    alexandre is a promiscuous bum  a womanizer and a gigolo  he lives with an older woman called marie  marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex  alex spends his days at caf s and restaurants  the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with  gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her  at this point  alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else    by chance  alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship  veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past  marie and veronika struggles for alex s affection and had a m nage   trois to boot  finally at the end  it s revealed veronika is pregnant with alex s child and alex asked her to marry him  we assume  as aforesaid with gilberte s situation  alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family  there is hope    with the title of  la maman et la putain  i deduce jean eustache was relating to fran oise lebrun s character of veronika  she was a whore and then she became the mother  hence  the mother and whore is the same person  anyway  what do i know  french films are mostly  not all  very chatty  aimlessly political  preaching  theatrical  insipid  lamenting and full of quotes  lebrun and l aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed    not a bad effort
