how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad  scary and life affirming  it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen  even though you were hoping maybe even beleiving it wouldn t   utlimately  this is the film s greatest strength  it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations  then drops a bomb on you   i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid s  it is not easy to find  but is definitely worth hunting for
