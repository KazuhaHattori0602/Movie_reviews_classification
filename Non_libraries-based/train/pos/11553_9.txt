there s more to offer in the opening of the odd couple than in the entirety of most films  felix unger  the poor guy s monogram even curses him  checks into a new york hotel  a cleaning lady says  good night   goodbye  he answers back  in his room he empties his pockets  then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope  addressed to his wife and beloved children  when the viewer finally puts it together   aha  he s going to off himself   we watch him struggle to open the window   oh no  he s going to jump   the poor guy injures his lower back  this is all you need to know about felix unger   his wife has left him  he s a compulsive cleaner and he s a hypochondriac  and all in one scene  this is the particular genius of neil simon s comedy   it s about situation and character  there are few obvious physical jokes   no kicks to the groin  no cheap gags   just funny characters in uncomfortable situations  and  of course  he is a master of manipulating the audience s expectations  coming from the swingers era  imagine what i thought in the date scene when felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment  he s blowing it  right  think again  the girls love his sensitivity  his ability to cry in front of them  they invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because oscar wasn t paying enough attention to it  he s in like flynn  right  uh  yes  but he doesn t want to go with the girls because he s feeling vulnerable  great stuff  and it s made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight room apartment set  you ve got jack lemmon and the slouchy  pouchy walter matthau for chrissakes  why mess it up  the visual style reminded me of breakfast at tiffany s  in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action  particularly memorable is the scene in which felix  fleeing from oscar  closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn t cover the side where oscar is coming from  you get a real sense of the layout of the apartment  and thus the proximity in which the two divorc es live  the twist here is that these two are really married   to each other  so the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys
