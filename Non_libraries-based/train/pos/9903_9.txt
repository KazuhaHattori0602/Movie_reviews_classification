wow  praise imdb and google  for i have been trying to remember the name of this f ing awesome movie for over   years now  slaughter high  man  hells yeah   i m not going to bore you with a plot summary  and actors  and yadda yadda yadda   cause you all know what s up  that s why you re here anyway  what i will do  however  is explain the fond memory i have of this quintessential  s d movie slasher joint   in   when i was around the age of   my father used to rent all these horror movies  would he care that his kids were watching them with him  no  so  at that young age i saw slaughter high  what i saw in that movie stuck with me big time  i haven t seen it since  but i remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie  for example  the post sex scene  why is there a metal bed in a school  gets electrocuted  or  the guy being drowned in a cess pool  come on  my personal favorite  though the exploding stomach from the tainted beer  amazing  how can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school  like    or   years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it  then his stomach explodes  what  and that great line  let s take my car it always starts  classic crap all the way    i mean  i look back now  almost   years later  and laugh at it  but when i was   i was scared sh tless  that jester hat  or was it a mask  that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f ck out   all in all  yes  a crappy movie  but for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a   out of   from me  either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same late late late movie show  or hunt down a vhs copy and dust off your vcr
