i have to say that sometimes  looks  are all that matters  just like jeremy clarkson from bbc has pointed out  not about our earth though  but he is right anyway   and when it comes to looks  this movie is such an unbelievably stunning beauty you will absolutely love what your eyes are about to see   and then there s the personality of the movie as well  interesting  with a captivating narrator voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul as you watch those superbly filmed images   the movie probably won t affect your lifestyle  ruining these beauties  but it will certainly remember you how precious our earth we live on truly is   this movie deserves it s   stars as it is one of the few stylistic earth documentaries i truly enjoyed
