what a gem of a movie  so good that they made a sequel   the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the   main characters first set eyes on each other   bendan hughes plays the eccentric vlad  a bit of an inkling there to who this character is  who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house   hell  we ve all seen vampire movies  we know the format   the movie is watchable  but the actors  performances are very wooden and they seem as they don t want to be in this film  but may be that s just all part of the decadent ambiance   didn t like the ending  but there is a sequel  must track it down   when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn t really fit the part  later on  i couldn t stop thinking about him  he sort of exudes an eerie sensuality  so maybe he was right for the part   brendan hughes last seen in  hitler   the rise of evil  as lt  guffman   where is he now
