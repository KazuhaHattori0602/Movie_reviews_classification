i only watched this because it starred josie lawrence  who i knew  from whose line is it anyway  the wacky british improvisational  comedy show  i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem  it is uplifting  touching  and  romantic without being sappy or sentimental  the characters are  all real people  with real foibles  fears and needs  see it
