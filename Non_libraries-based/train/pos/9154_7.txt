very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment   the script was very good as was the acting  the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film  this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending    i was going to give this film an   out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to   because it seemed to depart radically from the first   minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever    this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment  not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good
