  for this film   i m a british india doctor  currently in india  the word beckham put me off   cos i m a die hard liverpool fan  and personally think that owen is really cool  since liverpool and man utd are rivals  i was dead sure that i wouldn t watch the film   but then i was in delhi to meet some friends  and i had an early morning flight  so i thought   what the heck  let s bide time by watching this film   cos it was a late night show   what a moron i was  i should ve seen this film the day it was released  i guess using beckham s name was to draw audience attraction  which had back fired in my case  but then i really can t think of a better title for the film   and nagra  knightley  drop dead gorgeous  and rhys myers did a superb job   if you hate football  dislike manchester united  or england for that matter  then this is definately the film for you  in fact  i m just   yrs old  a psychiatrist by profession  but a kid at heart  this film has knocked  star wars  off my no  position   surprisingly  there aren t very many comments on this film by indian brits like me  i wonder why     for this film
