well  here s another terrific example of awkward  s film making  the rudimentary premise of  what s the matter with helen  is quite shocking and disturbing  but it s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion  in the hands of any other movie crew  this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale  but with director curtis harrington  whoever slew auntie roo  and scriptwriter henry farrell  hush
hush
sweet charlotte  in charge  it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres  the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific  but there s a lot more to experience  like love stories  a swinging  s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing  the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique  we re literally catapulted back to the  s  with a sublime depiction of that era s music  religion  theatrical business and wardrobes  following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder  adelle  debbie reynolds  and helen  shelley winters  flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls  particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment  as she falls in love with a local millionaire  but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia  she only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist  fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies  the script  although not entirely without flaws  is well written and the film is adequately paced  there s never a dull moment in  what s the matter with helen  although the singing  tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot  but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters  she s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who s about to snap any second and  especially during the last ten minutes or so  she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers  jason voorhees  and michael myers  combined  there are several terrific supportive characters who are  sadly  a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential  like mich al macliamm ir as the cocky elocution teacher  agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies  house  there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us  but particularly the set pieces and costume designs  even nominated for an oscar  are breathtaking
