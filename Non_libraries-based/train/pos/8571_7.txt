arguably this is a very good  sequel  better than the first live action film   dalmatians  it has good dogs  good actors  good jokes and all right slapstick    cruella devil  who has had some rather major therapy  is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them  many  including chloe simon  owner of one of the dogs that cruella once tried to kill  do not believe this  others  like kevin shepherd  owner of  nd chance dog shelter  believe that she has changed    meanwhile  dipstick  with his mate  have given birth to three cute dalmatian puppies  little dipper  domino and oddball   starring eric idle as waddlesworth  the hilarious macaw  glenn close as cruella herself and gerard depardieu as le pelt  another baddie  the name should give a clue  this is a good family film with excitement and lots more  one downfall of this film is that is has a lot of painful slapstick  but not quite as excessive as the last film  this is also funnier than the last film   enjoy   dalmatians
