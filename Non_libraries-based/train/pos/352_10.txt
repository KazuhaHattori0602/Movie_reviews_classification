i just saw  valentine  and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i ve seen in years  unlike the recent trend of  s horror flicks  this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking  for those out there that hated  scream  there is not one reference to  the horror rules  in this movie  even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here    this is the perfect blend of  s and  s horror  you get the style  cinematography  and good acting of  s films and the stalking slasher madness of an  s flick  i guess the year   is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for  this is definitely a move in the right direction   denise richards stands out here as a fun character  you can tell she liked her role  and that makes her stand out  i loved her in this movie
