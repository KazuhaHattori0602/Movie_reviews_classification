i was never a big fan of television until i watched   for the first time  i got into the series very late  season   ended before i even saw my very first episode  it was an episode of series   that was on my parents dvr  digital video recorder  box while i was house sitting for the weekend  it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer  and boy was i hooked  i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye  the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i ve ever spent  i watched the first three seasons in three weeks  that s   forty minute episodes  i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week  i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season   week to week  i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i m going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america  the dvr is set and you can bet i ll be chomping at the bit
