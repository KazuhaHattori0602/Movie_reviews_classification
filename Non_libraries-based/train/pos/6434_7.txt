after watching two of his silent shorts   elena and her men   is my first feature length film from french director jean renoir  and i quite enjoyed it  however  i didn t watch the film for renoir  but for star ingrid bergman  who   at age     still radiated unsurpassed beauty  elegance and charm  throughout the early  s  following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini  bergman temporarily fell out of public favour  her next five films  directed by her husband  were unsuccessful in the united states  and i suspect that renoir s latest release did little to enhance bergman s popularity with english speaking audiences  however  she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year s  anastasia   she stars as elena sokorowska  a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts  bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere  before promptly abandoning them  while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan  jean marais  she finds herself falling into a love that she won t be able to walk away from  this vaguely political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy  as long as you don t take it too seriously  it s purely lighthearted romantic fluff   filmed in vibrant technicolor   elena and her men  looks terrific as well  a flurry of bright colours  characters and costumes  bergman s polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self absorbed  not in an unlikable way  but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions  she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d tat  knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a  guardian angel  perhaps the film s only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt  mel ferrer  then audrey hepburn s husband  who ignores everybody else s selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love  and love alone  this  renoir proudly suggests  is what the true french do best   elena and her men  also attempts  with moderate success  to expose the superficiality of upper class french liaisons  through the clumsy philandering of eug ne  jacques jouanneau  who can t make love to his servant mistress without his fianc  walking in on them  for these sequences  renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film  but the film itself is so relaxed and laid back that the energy just isn t there
