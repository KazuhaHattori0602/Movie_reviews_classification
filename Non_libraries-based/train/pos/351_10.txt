it s a colorful slasher movie  that s about it   it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies  but i never care for such things  figuring out who s the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway   the death scenes were inventive and gorey  bringing back memories of  s horror movies like friday the  th    another nice thing about this movie is that it s hard to pinpoint the surviving girl  unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious    people who don t like slasher movies won t like this movie  as simple as that  i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same     mb
