out of these pokemon films  which are in order of best to least for me  pokemon the first movie  pokemon  ever  pokemon heroes  pokemon   and pokemon  entei and the unknown  this is probably the one most concerning the environment  arguably the most beautiful and the most calming one  whether these are good points for you or not   pokemon  ever  still has entertained many   as well as the three points covered above  this pokemon film includes good humour and good cgi  as well as anime  the time travelling theme of the film is represented in a good way and team rocket  the comic reliefs rubbish baddies  end up with quite good gags and end up being more main characters than sidekicks    the flaws are  as always  the rather unnecessary violence and action and the baddie is pretty uninteresting  even more so than a few pokemon film baddies    a strange pokemon is being tracked down by a pokemon hunter in a forest  a young boy tries to save the pokemon and it takes him somewhere   meanwhile  ash  brock and misty are entering a large forest   curious  watch the rest   good for all pokemon fans and  american  anime movie fans  enjoy  pokemon  ever
