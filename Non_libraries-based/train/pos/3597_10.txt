 spoilers   i was blown away by this movie  i ve been renting on movielink for a bit  and decided to check this movie out  alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood  in this movie  it shows it at the amature level  though i do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades  the movie points out the problems some families face with gender   i was a bit concerned with the ending  but the ending wasn t a disappointment either   i think it was pretty clear by the title that she d win  what was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end   loved the score for some of the scenes  highly recommended      quality     entertainment     replayable
