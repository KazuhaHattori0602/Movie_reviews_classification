i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect   and as i am about to study film making in canada of all places  i most certainly will bring this up in class   the story  centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself  is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time   if you simply couldn t laugh during  hollywood north  i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away   you might have serious issues   besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah kara unger and matthew modine   where they really just acting  jennifer tilly  playing a hilariously bad actress  and martin landau  also delivered a very edgy  yet funny performance   great film  even better cast
