one of the more satisfying western all italiana  johnny yuma has the freshness of many wai made during the heyday of the genre and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or offbeat  intelligent cinema   johnny yuma is  in most respects  not terribly original  but this actually does not count against it  the success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the audience s expectations as well as provides surprising variations on these expected elements  earlier  pleasing experiences are recreated but with subtle  or major  twist that provide continuing interest  the quality of the execution is also  obviously  important  a tired retread will be less successful than a sincere attempt to entertain or move the audience   given these criteria  johnny yuma succeeds  there are numerous reprises of elements from earlier films  the setting is the brutal  twisted semi feudal twilight world of shared by many of the best  gothic family  westerns made   such as tempo di massacre   the plot is a combination of the basic fistful of dollars   plot and the ringo films  a fact not surprising as screenwriter fendiando di leo was involved in both  di leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular cinema coming out of cinecitta in the  s s and his work helped provide much of the thematic continuities and coherency to the genre  along with a couple of other personalities in a few distinct circles of actors  directors  and screenwriters  in the fod plot  the protagonist arrives in town  stirs up a tense situation  then undergoes a near death followed by a resurrection  in some films  like quella sporca storia nel west   it is quite literally a crucifixion  the catholic undertone to the narrative and the symbolism is intriguing  especially given the implicit populist explicit socialist leanings of the filmmakers and their films  the ringo plot  developed more fully by screenwriter ernesto gastaldi in a series of films starring guliano gemma  a egoistic protagonist chooses the interest of a community over his own through the medium of a relationship with a member of that community  with a healthy dash ironic uncertainty   the relationship between carradine and johnny is clearly based on that of manco mortimer from a fistful of dollar   the two scene of the exchange of the gun belts provides a clever dialog and understanding between the two  numerous films  including da uomo a uomo   or even el chuncho  qui n sabe    use this relationship between an older and younger man  father son  older younger brother  anglo adviser adversary and peasant revolutionary  as a central dynamic to the plot   additionally  there is the focus on deception and misdirection  mazes and mirrors  that recur throughout the best early wai  the canons and pueblos of almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play shifting games of cat and mouse   what distinguishes johnny yuma from other wai is the quality of director romolo guerriri s use of visual psychological space together arrangement with the script s intelligent mechanisms to forward the plot  dialogue was never very important to the wai and often absurdly unintelligible  thought there are exceptions  such as the cynical commentaries in django   or faccia a faccia    psychological depth of character is created almost entirely through iconic imagery  it s juxtapositions  and it s description of the overall narrative situation  see how the presence of the deadly samantha is felt during the beating scene   watching from the roof or from the background of the action  or how johnny strips samantha and pedro of their security and confidence in their power through his stealthy invasions of their ranch  hotel  even bedroom  this  again  is a theme from fod  finally  note how there is a focus on the search for information  like many elements  this is borrowed from fod which was ultimately based on the hard boiled mystery novel red harvest  it is through incidental contacts  wanted posters  overheard conversations  glances out of windows  watches left in the dust  or mistaken identities and movements through the ripples created by the actions of pedro and samantha within this surreal and absurd reality that the narrative tacks forward to it s conclusion   the movie was notable in it s time for what were perceived of as excesses in violence  of course  these films were hardly more violent than many american westerns  what was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes to which it was attributed  which is to say that it was not the violence but it s meaning that had changed  johnny yuma is distinct and interesting in it s use and portrayal of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film   what i personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it provides to the anonymous  nameless audiences in italy and spain to whom these recurrent narratives held some significance and interest  the artifact may have no intrinsic worth in and of itself   some flint debitage from a prehistoric site  a shard of cruse pottery  or a moldering piece of leather and rusted metal   but it is reference to some nameless presence  lives  that were significant simply because they existed  while johnny yuma has intrinsic worth  much of it s interest for me derives from this connection and mystery   top spaghetti western list     average sws     for fanatics only  bottom of the barrel
