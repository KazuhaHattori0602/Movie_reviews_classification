johnny dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it s overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense  but that s the point  right   the cast is likable  michael keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed  griffin dunne  peter boyle  joe piscopo  marilu henner and danny devito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me  but the complete scene stealer here is richard dimitri  sneaking the word  iceholes  into movie history  as a mobster who fares best at murdering the english language   i associate many childhood memories with this film  as i watched it quite often so maybe i m prone to enjoy it more than many others  johnny dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking  and sex   i like it but it s hard to recommend     out of
