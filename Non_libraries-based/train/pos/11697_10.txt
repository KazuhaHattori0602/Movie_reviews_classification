this film was really eye opening  i have seen this film several times  first  when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was   the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him   a great movie for non believers and believers alike
