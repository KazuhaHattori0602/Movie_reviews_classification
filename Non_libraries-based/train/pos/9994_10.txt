 life stinks  is a parody of life and death  happiness and depression  the black and the white always present in our lives  mel brooks performance is brilliant as always  and the other actors work is fine too  this movie has some capra flavor  that s why is so good   there are some unforgettable gags such as the one when brooks tries to earn some money dancing in the street  and all the people passing by just ignore him  or when he meets a funny crazy man who believes is paul getty and then start arguing and slapping each other   if you haven t seen it  you don t know what you ve missed   this movie tells us about the old and eternal struggle of the poor against the rich    the only difference between this movie and reality is that this movie has a happy ending  and reality hasn t   yes indeed  life stinks
