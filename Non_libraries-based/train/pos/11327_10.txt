this movie probably had a   budget  and still managed to surpass titanic  i rented this the day i crashed my mom s car  and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief  it has to be tied with  the assult of the killer bimbos  things to look for are    the drive in blow job chinese girl scene   the bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes   the flinstone like screech out driving   the clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed  don t worry  i m not ruining any surprises  for it s soooo predictable    the guy who finds it necessary to howl    the mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen    the hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest    the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall    last  but not least  the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a  heaven help me  popping noise   enjoy
