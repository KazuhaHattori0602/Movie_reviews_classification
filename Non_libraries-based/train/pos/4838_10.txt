this movie reminded me that some old black   white movies are definitely worth the look   initially i had some reservations  however from the beginning of the movie until the end i was captivated  i was very impressed with the mixture of drama  suspense   comedy   arthur askey  tommy gander  is hilarious and had me in stitches the whole time   definitely add this movie to your movie night for some light relief from the sometimes depressing and  too  powerful or overly  funny  movies of today
