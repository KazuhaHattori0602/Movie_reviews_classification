nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of italian zombie flicks  but   honestly   why would we bother  every single film in the zombi series  delivers great fun  nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and  zombi   is no exception to this  despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting  this film began as an interesting lucio fulci project  who had to elaborate further on his  zombi   success  but it ended up being a typical bruno mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films  the screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity  every ingenious idea from george a  romero s  night of the living dead  and  the crazies  is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at  yet all this didn t upset me for one moment because the sublime over the top gore compensates for everything  on a secret army base at the phillipines  scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus  death one  and prepare it for transport  after a failing attempt to steal the virus  the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village  the last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area  this movie is comparable to umberto lenzi s  nightmare city  truly bad but incredibly entertaining with fast paced action sequences and several very creative zombie madness situations  the undead birds were original  for example  and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well  the infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it s made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant italian zombie flick  recommended to the fans  don t mind the negative reviews
