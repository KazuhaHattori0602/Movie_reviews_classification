this is almost typical lynch  however  what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw  almost amateurish  but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism  which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments   however  a lot of typical lynch motifs are present  such as  floating camera work  haunting music  long  excruciating  pauses  hanging curtains  dim lights growing darker at a slow  almost indiscernible  pace  extreme close ups  themes of women in trouble  over bearing  incompassionate  all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught  temporarily oblivious  in the dark and so on   the performances are great and the short is thought provoking  as usual  lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation  many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination   another brilliant effort from lynch  i only hope he makes some shorts  more along the lines of his sony playstation   commercials  they were inspired
