convoluted  infuriating and implausible  fay grim is hard to sit through but parker posey is really the only actress who could take this story and run with it  she s at once touching funny  cunning  the supporting actors commit to it as well   i wont even try to tell you the plot  it involves characters from hartley s henry fool and attempts a tale of international espionage   the film works well if you continue along with it understanding it is  in a sense  completely ridiculous  it becomes more and more ridiculous as you plod along   i resisted the temptation to turn off the dvd twice   fay grim requires an adventurous film goer willing to tackle something that isn t cookie cutter  in the end  it offers something that defies description
