this is the best film version of dicken s classic tale  i ve seen it over and over on vhs  and recently acquired the dvd version  which is formatted for tv  not wide screen  what i find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of english actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other films shows in north america since   my biggest surprise is edward woodward   the equalizer  as the ghost of christmas present
