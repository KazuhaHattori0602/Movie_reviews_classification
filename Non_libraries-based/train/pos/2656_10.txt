at times  this overtakes the thing as my favourite horror film  while carpenter s film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick  kubrick s is more artistic  more thought provoking  and probably scarier  it s one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it  i try not to compare it to the book   which i ve only read once  a number of years ago  and which scared me to death   because the two don t have a lot in common  besides the story and characters obviously  it s almost as if kubrick was banking on people s love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening  and it that way  it s certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made  as well as one of the greatest horror films   what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares  not the blood and gore  not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time  it s the destruction of jack torrence  some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role  saying that it s too obvious that he s going to go crazy in the film  given his past roles and his appearance  i disagree  we know he s going to go crazy   since most of us have read the book   and jack s appearance only furthers this notion  but it s the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared  he s calm  quiet  patient  he engages in inane small talk with the hotel managers and even with his own family  and with a wife and son as irritating as his  it s a small wonder that he manages to do so  but once he gets to the overlook  he changes  he becomes irritable  angry  on edge  the scene that always shocks me is when wendy interrupts him typing  and he utterly loses it  telling her to  leave him the f  alone  this is the first f bomb dropped in the film  and it s a shock to the system  from then on  all bets are off   another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film  we re never really sure if what we re seeing is actually happening  many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost  there s a mirror present  showing that he may as well be talking to himself  but what of the other characters  wendy never sees anything until the film s climax  until she is given a tour of the hotel s many ghostly inhabitants  but she is well aware that something is wrong  while danny connects with the place almost immediately  his psychic powers are not in question   how else would hallorann know to come to the hotel    but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness  it s easy to claim that jack merely loses it  being trapped in a hotel with his family  and wendy later does as well   seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that   but what of danny  it appears that his body is taken over by tony  but how do we know for sure  none of these characters are reliable witnesses  hallorann probably would be  and he warns of the dangers in   but he s killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook  a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the assumptions of fans of the novel  and that final shot  has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema  has jack really been there before  or was his body merely  absorbed  into the hotel  when talking about the acting in this film  any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson  shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history   probably on purpose  to give jack s character more of a reason to snap   and danny lloyd is no better  but jack is a powerhouse  part method  part improvisation  he s simultaneously terrifying and appealing  for better or for worse  he s the character with whom we identify with  not the annoying kid or nagging wife  we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season  be able to do whatever we want  who cares if it s haunted  of course  the technical aspects are terrific  kubrick s long takes  strange angles  and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror  the use of colour  mirrors  long hallways  and every other motif only heightens this  and don t even get me started on that score  i don t know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting  electronic tune  its strangeness perfectly reflects the hotel  the mood  and the entire film itself   i know king doesn t like this film  but king s input on cinema is nothing to brag about  as great of a novel writer he may be  his screenplays are terrible  and his attempt at directing is better left unnoticed  this is not a very faithful book adaptation  but it doesn t need to be  and it really shouldn t  part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn t have the book to fall back on  there s no reassuring source material  kubrick masterfully alters the narrative to terrify the audience even more  if only for that  this is one of the most innovative films in any genre  and it s got everything else on top of that
