garde   vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub plots it contains  if you re not used to french wordy films  based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action  don t even try to watch it  you ll only obtain boredom to death  and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you   garde   vue is a wordy film  essentially based upon dialogs  written by audiard by the way and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances   why does ma tre martineau  serrault  prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth   because at the time of the murder he was with a   years old girl with which he has a  years sexual relation  his wife knows it  she s jealous of it and he prefers to be executed  in   in france  there was still death penalty rather than unveiling the sole  pure and innocent  aspect of his pitiful life
