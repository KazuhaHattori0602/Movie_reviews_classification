when originally screened in america in    the night stalker  became the highest rated made for t v  movie in history  based on jeff rice s unpublished novel  it told how a fearless investigative reporter named carl kolchak   the late darren mcgavin   discovered the existence of a vampire in modern day las vegas  when it arrived on british television four years later  it did not quite have the same impact  but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning  as indeed was i  we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen    i did not know of the existence of  the night strangler  until it turned up nearly a decade later  i t v  who screened the  kolchak  movies  had apparently decided to pass on the spin off series  they felt  barnaby jones  starring buddy ebsen to be more of a draw  and anyway  viewers might confuse  kolchak  with  kojak  for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in fangoria magazine  i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels   then something wonderful happened  in   b b c  put out the show as part of a late night friday series devoted to the supernatural called  mystery train  hosted by richard o brian   kolchak  found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of  the brain eaters  and  earth vs the spider  the opening titles were trimmed  removing kolchak s whistling  and the closing credits well  there were none   the first episode screened was  werewolf  i cannot say i was overly impressed  but stuck with it  and am i glad that i did   i really wish i d seen it in   my twelve year old self would have adored it  creepy  humorous  exciting  no wonder it fired chris carter s imagination    the show s biggest asset was  of course  mcgavin  unlike the recent kolchak  the original was an everyman figure  eccentrically dressed  rather conservative  he was to the supernatural what  columbo  was to crime  the late simon oakland was great too as kolchak s bad tempered boss tony vincenzo  the scripts overflowed with wonderful  dry wit  i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror  when the twenty episodes ended  i felt bereft    the x files  came along a few years later and filled the void   but only to an extent  i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back  i am glad that the show was never revived though  without oakland it would not have been the same   i have the rice books now and have read them several times  i was very surprised when stephen king slated the first   in his book  danse macabre    as it is as good as anything he has written    alright  so some of the monsters were hardly state of the art  but so what  the new  kolchak  totally missed the point of the original  what you don t see is sometimes more frightening than what you do   best episode    horror in the heights  worst episode    the sentry
