this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have  romance  clever witticisms  great acting and a fair dose of magic    i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot  based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read  and colorful characters   one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is  unlike so many sci fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open endings and such this was a pure fairy tale  satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel   original  fun  feel good fantasy
