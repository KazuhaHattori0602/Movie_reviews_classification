i really enjoyed the  s  not being of that generation  i m waiting for  the  s  it was interesting to see a unique four hour capsule for that era   one major problem in the movie  however  was how unbalanced the film was in the portrayal of the families  according to promos i saw for the movie on nbc  the story was basically about two families struggling with issues in  s america  now  i may have missed something  but i think we learned more about the white family than the african american family   i really think that the  s uses music to describe the scenes better than any dialogue that could come out of the mouths of the actors  all of which are very talented  this is very visible at the end of the first part  about two hours in  of the mini series   very good movie
