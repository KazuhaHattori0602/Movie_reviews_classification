this is the first jean renoir silent film i have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best  besides being also his first major work  overall  it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only renoir s sophomore effort  for fans of the director  it is full of interesting hints at future renoir movies especially the diary of a chambermaid   and the golden coach     in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her   but also the rules of the game     showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters  backs are turned away from them   and french cancan     nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point  personally  i would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to g w  pabst s pandora s box   josef von sternberg s the blue angel   and max ophuls  lola montes   in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan   having said all that  the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release   a  mad undertaking  as renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which  not only personally cost him a fortune  he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father s paintings  but almost made him give up the cinema for good  stylistically  nana is quite different from renoir s sound work and owes a particular debt to erich von stroheim s foolish wives   a film renoir greatly admired   and  on a personal note  one which i really ought to revisit presto  having owned the kino dvd of it and the other von stroheims for   years now  anyway  nana is certainly not without its flaws  a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous   minute running time with some sequences  the horse race around the mid point in particular  going on too long   the overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times   particularly that of catherine hessling s nana and raymond guerin catelain s georges hugon  one of her various suitors although  technically  they are being their characters i e  a bad actress  who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage  and an immature weakling  respectively  however  like anna magnani in the golden coach  hessling  renoir s wife at the time  by the way  is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as  the epitome of elegance   as another admirer describes her at one stage  who is able to enslave every man she meets  other notables in the cast are  dr  caligari  himself  werner krauss  as nana s most fervent devotee  count muffat  jean angelo  as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of nana s  and future distinguished film director claude autant lara  billed as claude moore and also serving as art director here  as muffat s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter s neglected wife    the print i watched   via lionsgate s  jean renoir  disc collector s edition    is  for the most part  a lovingly restored and beautifully tinted one which had been previously available only on french dvd  being based on a classic of french literature  by emile zola  no less  it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are dorothy arzner s in    with anna sten and lionel atwill and which i own on vhs  and christian jaque s in    with martine carol and charles boyer  which i am not familiar with
