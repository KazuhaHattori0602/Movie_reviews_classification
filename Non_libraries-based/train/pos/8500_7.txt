surprised to see the rather low score for this movie  just saw this film for the first time in   years  and was reminded why i like it   come back with me  children  to a time when michael keaton was a straight up comedy guy  and you might find some joy in this film  it s a gentle comedy   the kind ron howard specializes in   but if that s your thing  you should check this out  keaton s low key charm is just right for this project    gung ho  is a bit dated  because it takes places in the last stage of the pre global economy world  when it still mattered what country a business was based in  that said  it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other  to great benefit   you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked  but that s because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs  it s like an i v  drip  and i mean that in a good way
