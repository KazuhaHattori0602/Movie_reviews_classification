on the  th of december    in the grand caf  in paris  film history was writing itself while louis lumi re showed his short films  all single shots  to a paying audience   la sortie des usines lumi re  was the first film to be played and i wish i was there  not only to see the film  but also the reactions of the audience   we start with closed doors of the lumi re factory  apparently  since the image seems a photograph  people thought they were just going to see a slide show  not something they were hoping for  but then the doors open and people are streaming out  heading home  first a lot of women  then some men  and one man on a bike with a big dog  when they are all out the doors close again   whether this is the first film or not  some say  l arriv e d un train   la ciotat  was the first film lumi re recorded  it is an impressive piece of early cinema  being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons  one simple reason  it is only fifty seconds long  but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here  you don t get to see historical things like this every day
