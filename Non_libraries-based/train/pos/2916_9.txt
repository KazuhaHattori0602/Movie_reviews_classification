of all the movies i have seen  and that s most of them  this is by far the best one made that is primarily about the u s  naval airships  blimps  during the ww ii era  yes there are other good lta related movies  but most use special effects more than any real time shots  this man s navy has considerably more real time footage of blimps etc  true  lots of corny dialog but that s what makes more interesting hollywood movies  even today  p s  i spent   years out of   and have over   hours in navy airships of all types  from   through   proud member of the naval airship association etc  [atc la ac  usn retired]
