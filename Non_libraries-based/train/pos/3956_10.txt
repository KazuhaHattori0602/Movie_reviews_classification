husbands beware is a remake of the shemp classic brideless groom  the film s new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great  the stooges are always funny when they cook  however after the first few minutes of cooking footage  we cut to original footage of brideless groom  one thing i noticed about these   to   remakes are that they do fit with the new story  they do an insert shot if the old story line doesn t match   husbands beware does have a new ending  but i won t give it away to those who want to be surprised      out of   stars
