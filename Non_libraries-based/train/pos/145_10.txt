sequel to  the kingdom  is bloodier and even more twisted  i only saw half  i was exhausted and couldn t sit through all     hours  but i loved what i saw  ghosts  blood  murder  poisoning  mutated babies  voodoo this has it all  if you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you   also  you don t have to see part   to understand this you ll figure it out   does anyone know if kingdom   and   are available on dvd  sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring    sadly  there probably won t be a  kingdom  ernst hugo jaregard  sig  died a year after this was filmed  but you never know
