the plot of this film might not be extraordinary  but what makes the film really special  are its characters  and the actors who play them   of course  i won t go into the details of the plot of the movie  but i would certainly like to say this   this film is not just for everyone  the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire  if you re not alert even for a second  you ll probably end up missing one of the subtle points  the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff   like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan  the advertisements on the tankers  which i almost missed  and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout   coming to the actors  john cusack has played his multi faceted role very efficiently  what with him being the co writer and the producer too  and he plays his character   hauser  the killer with a heart   exquisitely  cusack s done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank  but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb   however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff  i have always been a huge fan of ms  duff  but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she s playing in the movie  but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor  let s face it  the kid s growing  but yes  so is her talent  all those critics  who shouted hoarse that hilary cannot act  will be silent for a while  hilary had to play a really complex character   tough on the outside  yet a sweet child on the inside   and she s done complete justice to it  she makes you laugh  and she makes you cry   to cut the long story short  cause i could go on raving about her for ever  she s brilliant  marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too  especially  joan s hysterics are uproarious  however  i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster   in general war  inc  keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor  and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot  i would highly recommend this movie to all  and more so to hilary duff fans  p s    i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon
