it appears even the director doesn t like this film but for me i think he s being a bit harsh on himself   sure it s not perfect  but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout   it s shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well   if you like horror films shot in england  give it a go   i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film  the devil s chair  which looks quite amazing   there aren t enough english horror films for me  so any that come along deserve our attention  and this one isn t as bad as you may think
