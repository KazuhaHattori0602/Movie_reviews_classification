i  like many horror fans  have been force fed the same banal big budget hollywood remakes and mtv high school slasher tripe for the last   years  here  at last  is an original horror genre movie that ticks all the right boxes   you want a hot lead actress  you want vampires  you want cool weapons  you want cool vehicles and you want blood  lots of it  by the bucket load   you got it   with excellent fight choreography and a supporting role from the hammer horror scream queen herself stephanie beacham  this really is fantastic stuff   despite it s low budget  by opting to use   mm stock and adding quality cg effects to the mix  director james eaves has created something that feels much bigger   a must for old school horror fans
