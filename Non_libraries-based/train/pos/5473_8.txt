this one is considered a key pre code film   from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story   but also the paranoid sci fi invasion u s a      and features one of barbara stanwyck s best early roles   she s supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day   george brent  douglass dumbrille  edward van sloan  nat pendleton and john wayne  at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname  derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout  in the former category and  in the latter  robert barrat  as stanwyck s father  donald cook  as her most tragic conquest  alphonse ethier  as her elderly mentor   more on this later  arthur hohl  as a lecherous politician  and henry kolker  as cook s boss and father in law  whom stanwyck also seduces  curiously  scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors   abetted by crackling i e  typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets  the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual ethier  stanwyck complains to him early on that she s no  ball of fire  which  of course  contradicts her later comedy   directed by howard hawks and co starring gary cooper   of that name  under ethier s auspices  she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success  the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she s eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one   relating to an ambitious statesman s lust for power   in sergei eisenstein s october   sociologically  it s also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companion   the first two thirds of the film are simply terrific  at first  i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing   because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced george brent character while he ignores her
but  just like the others  he s soon under her spell  on second viewing  however  this aspect felt less jarring   as it s evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused  and that her tenure in paris has softened her  even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as it s possible   released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume   collection  the film is presented in two strikingly different edits   a recently unearthed pre release version and the tamer theatrical release print  among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck s life as a tramp from the age of    though it s heard in the accompanying trailer  while many other scenes have been shortened  i e  censored for content  the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances  the seduction at the railroad car  the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook  the shooting  followed by a suicide  only shots are heard in the shorter version  stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing  again  only brent appears in the version released to theaters  etc  tha latter  then  utilizes alternate takes for some scenes   and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version  however  we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending  the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note  and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which  basically  has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche
