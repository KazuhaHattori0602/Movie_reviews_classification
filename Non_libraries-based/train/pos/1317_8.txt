this anime was underrated and still is  hardly the dorky kids movie as noted  i still come back to this   years after i first saw it  one of the better movies released   the animation while not perfect is good  camera tricks give it a  d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon  it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view  it s a story to entertain  not to question   still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes  not to say its a childish movies  there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all
