yes  the plot is predictable  yes  there are a few plot holes  yes  it has a made for tv quality  and yes  britney spears  wrote  the book with obvious self promotion   but forget all of that  this movie is fun   fun in an after school special sort of way  but fun nevertheless   virginia madsen as the mother does a great job  so good that i m going to start watching for her movies  she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons   the rest of the cast does a fine job  too  if i was a casting agent  i d be scouting some of these young actors   the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great  better than several big budget movies i ve seen   if you re in the mood for german noir this movie isn t for you  if you want a safe  fun and underrated movie  this is a good one  it s one you could show to your   year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too
