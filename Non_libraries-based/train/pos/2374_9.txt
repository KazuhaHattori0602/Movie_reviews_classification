the year   saw no fewer than   filmed productions of h  g  wells  great novel   war of the worlds  this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them  no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it  but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place  the last year of the  th century    
 using wells  original setting  in and near woking  england   imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as  spoilers  that might apply with some films  where the ending might actually be a surprise  but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world  it seems positively silly  i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature  so let s get right to the chase  the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease  against which they have no immunity  if that s a spoiler  so be it  after a book and   other films  including the   classic  you ought to know how this ends   this film  which follows wells  plot in the main  is also very cleverly presented   in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late  th early  th century photography  although filmed in a widescreen aspect  the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity  the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs  rather than black  colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting  at other times  colors are washed out  these variations are typical of early films  which didn t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality  even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on   as you ll see on occasion here  the special effects are deliberately retrograde  of a sort seen even as late as the  s   and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic  feel  some of effects are really awkward   such as the destruction of big ben  the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours  some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd  particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair   this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells  original narrative   as has been noted  viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story  wells  description of the martians   a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles   is effectively portrayed  when the martian machines appear  about an hour into the film  they too give a good impression of how wells described them  both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective  primarily  of rural england   plus a few scenes in london  involving the narrator s brother  the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark  big ben  but at least doesn t dwell unduly on the devastation of london   the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise  despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines  the narrator  traveling about to seek escape  sees much of what wells terms  the rout of mankind  he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality  they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest  where they discover an awful fact  the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene  wells adds that after eating they set up  a prolonged and cheerful hooting  the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate   who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder  cheers from the gallery  british curates are so often utterly insufferable   this film lasts almost   hours  going through wells  story in welcome detail  it s about time the author got his due   in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact  a word about the acting  don t expect award winning performances  they re not bad  however  the actors are earnest and they grow on you  most of them  however  have had very abbreviated film careers  often only in this film  the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana  in his  nd film  the curate is john kaufman   also in his  nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing  the brother  henderson  is played with some conviction by w  bernard bauman in his first film  the artilleryman  the only other sizable part  is played by james lathrop in his first film   this is overall a splendid film  portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it  despite its slight defects  it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors  if you want to see h  g  wells  war of the worlds   and not some wholly distorted version of it   see this film
