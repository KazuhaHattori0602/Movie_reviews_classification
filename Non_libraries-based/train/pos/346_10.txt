what an awesome movie  it was very scary  great acting  well written  nice plot twists  interesting characters  very good direction  and a surprise ending that will leave you with a smile on your face  this is one popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non horror fans  but is still  nonetheless  one of the best thrillers out there today  i highly recommend it to only fans of     the horror genre  or    an actor or actress featured in it     out of   stars   ps  i am sick and tired of people comparing this  and other modern horror movies  with scream  ya know what  they didn t want to be like scream  everyone s like  oh  they copied scream  well  if i am not mistaking  scream also copied other movies too  in fact  just about every horror movie copied an earlier one  scream  however  was a good film  but  still  stop comparing and enjoy it for what it is   go and rent this one
