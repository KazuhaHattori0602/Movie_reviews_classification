astounding this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie  but i sure enjoyed it   that last man who commented is a fool  this movie was one of a kind  and the music dark  jerry goldsmith himself  would had applaud this movie   great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film   i collect horror movies and soundtracks  so listen to what i have to say  not that other idiot   there is only one thing that do not fascinate me  the endings   according to prophecy it is all inaccurate  including final conflict  and left behind   but my conclusion being  there great movies and should be seen  before the great depression falls upon us  and before the democrats take over the presidency too   so signed jacob eder a farmer  with a mastermind
