  he was born in   in dayton  ohio  simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man  but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses  he did a good acting job  who can disagree  i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie  must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least  i first saw this movie when i was   in the sixth grade  i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered  and that high schools do not have bath tubs  i think caroline munro who was   at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent  and unfortunately for simon s death he made no future films  the reason s  for his suicide are a mystery  and hopefully will be discovered in the near future  doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was   years old when he made slaughter high  he looked like a teenager  i give this film two thumbs up  the best horror film made  probably because of their horrible acting the others didn t make fame in the movie business   jacob young
