 the italian  is among the great or near great films of   that are available today  the year was a turning point for the feature length film  especially in america  lois weber s  hypocrites  cecil b  demille s  the cheat  and  of course  d w  griffith s  the birth of a nation  set new benchmarks for the art  additionally  that year  russian filmmaker yevgeni bauer made two of his best pictures   after death  and  daydreams  the french serial  les vampires  also has its admirers today  although i disagree with them  the emergence of the feature length film was led by europe  mainly denmark  france and italy  but dominance of this market and  to a degree  the art shifted to across the atlantic in    the most overriding artistic achievement of  the italian  is its stunning and often innovative cinematography  there are some picturesque sunsets  mobile framing  including a brief overhead angled shot of the italian racing to buy a wedding ring and another shot of him holding onto a moving car  and  in general  there is wise use of varied camera angles and expert lighting throughout  an especially amazing shot is a close up of the italian enraged as he slowly approaches the camera for an extreme close up  in reference to d w  griffith s  musketeers of pig alley    he s so enraged his environment even begins to shake around his anger   unfortunately  the cinematographer appears to be unknown  the director  although originally without credit in the film  is now known to have been reginald barker  five or so of his other films made for ince are also available today  but are rather unremarkable   civilization    which he worked on  was a large production  but a deeply flawed movie  by the way  i d guess that one or more of the various cinematographers who worked on  civilization  also photographed  the italian   moreover  the entire production is very advanced for then  venice and new york are well rendered despite the film being shot in los angeles  for romanticized venice  and san francisco  for the ethnic slums of new york  there are extensive flashbacks  although perhaps one or two too many  i especially like the clever framing of the narrative as being read in a book by a character played by the same actor  george beban  who is also the lead in the inner  main narrative  the reading of the story is further briefly framed by the opening at the beginning and closing at the end of curtain drapes    la the theatre  which is reflected within the inner story during the revenge climax in the child s room  with the opening and closing of window curtains  parallel editing  in camera dissolves and irises and such are handled expertly  additionally  beban and clara williams  as his wife  play their parts well   on the other hand   the italian  does have a few drawbacks  the film s early moments of comedy clash rather disharmoniously with the latter parts of harsh and heavy melodrama  although the environmental changes from romanticized italy to naturalistic new york works well mostly because it s supported by the lighting and photography  the harsh dissolution of the american dream in this film  enhanced by the stark photography  must have been poignant to the immigrant classes who comprised a disproportionately large population of the movie going public back then  the corrigan character should have been foreshadowed more  his brief introduction campaigning for another politician seems inadequate for his later centrality to the italian s revenge  in addition  the filmmakers were either medically na f or careless to not explain the lack of breastfeeding of the infant and the unwarranted faith in the healing powers of quietness for the other child  aside from the deficiencies in plot   the italian  is exceptionally well made
