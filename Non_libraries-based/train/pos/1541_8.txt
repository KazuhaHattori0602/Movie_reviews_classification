just saw this movie today at the seattle international film festival  and enjoyed it thoroughly   great writing and direction  excellent and believable interaction among the cast  and great comic timing as well   this movie touches on themes that are universal family and separation  as a result  i can see european  asian  and american audiences all finding points of similarity between this film and their own lives   if all that wasn t enough  this has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year somebody distribute this in the usa  please   finally  thank you maria flom  it really is a great film
