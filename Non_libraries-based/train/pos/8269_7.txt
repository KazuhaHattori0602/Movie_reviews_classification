i ve been intrigued by this film for a while  in part because of the extremely high score here on imdb   a   average with over   votes gives it the highest rating of any accessible silent film  how had i not heard of this film before this website  well  you can t always trust the ratings  this is actually a very good film  preserved quite well if the fine vhs transfer i rented is any indication   excellent acting by the principals  especially william haines as brown  and good location work at cambridge with some fine action footage in the climactic harvard yale football game   but the story must have seemed a hoary chestnut even in   obnoxious  self centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets put in his place  becoming in the process a caring  self sacrificing friend  i doubt people in   found much that was really exciting in the last few reels  the predictability factor is high  still  it starts out very well  and is certainly deserving of being remembered  if not praised to the heavens  maybe the previous   voters are mostly harvard men   edit now   voters and the score has actually climbed to   seriously  folks  there is ballot stuffing going on here   i defy anybody to explain why this is a better film than  metropolis  or  the general
