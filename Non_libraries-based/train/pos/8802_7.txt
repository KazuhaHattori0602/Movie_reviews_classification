this is a very interesting project which could have been quite brilliant  gathering   prominent international directors and allotting each of them   minutes    seconds and   frame to create a segment of their choice  each short exploring the global reverberations of   without using any spoilers  i would say that ken loach s piece is the jewel in the crown  and mira nair s short  segment  india  based on a true story  deserves to be made into a full feature film  one also realizes  while watching his short  why alejandro gonz lez i rritu is one of the best directors in the world today   he simply is a master of the medium  who has also a profound understanding of the subject matter  unfortunately  not all   parts are made as well  youssef chahine  in his segment  egypt  assumes the arab stance of the self inflicted collective guilt  which piece could have potentially been the most interesting one  he fails miserably  chahine s short is poorly written and badly executed  at least enough to stand out amongst other  superior chapters of the film  despite the imbalance in quality  i would still give the film   for concept  if not for execution
