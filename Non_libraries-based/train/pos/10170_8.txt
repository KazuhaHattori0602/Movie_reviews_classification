in complete contrast to the opinions of the other review  this film actually was surprisingly good  i reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clich s  obvious jokes and overacting  all of which the trailer had promised   however  after   minutes in i found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting  with only one  toilet humour  gag  over her dead body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and  without spoiling anything too much  some of the moments involving animals are hilarious   the staple ingredients of a good film are all there  script  director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy  this film stands tall   sure  you aren t going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening  but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time
