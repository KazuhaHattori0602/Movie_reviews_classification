this movie answers the question  how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent  clinging  needy  jealous   and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women   without spoiling the movie  i can safely assure you it does not  but there s great fun to be had along the way  uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super heroine  an uber babe  mysteriously named g girl  who unlike most in her sisterhood  is not  always  dedicated to truth  justice  and the american way    thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft  yet somehow still fetching  curator jenny  when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival  g girl goes ballistic  and what follows is not pretty  it s funny  but it s not pretty    it s a delightful premise  hell hath no fury like a super heroine scorned  and those involved don t altogether carry it off  but it has its moments  and i think i ll get the dvd   i liked this movie
