this film is shockingly underrated on imdb  like so many films  this isn t shawshank  but it s a reasonably good  if predictable  dance competition   personal growth film  if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of   mile for a female step dancer  than i think you ll like it   judging from the imdb ratings  my guess is that this movie was approaching the top   and was  vote bombed  with many  s  as happens to so many films that aren t about the mob  don t have special effects  or include non white or non straight characters   it s an american film  but it s not a us film  set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle  and some audiences may think it s set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit   i liked the music  i liked the dance  but not convinced it s worth     but what do i know  the characters were easy on the eyes   i do agree the title sucks  i don t remember anyone in the film saying those words  and it should have an  s   no  it s not a foreign language   there s not a lot to hate about this film  and let s be honest  a vote of   means you hated it  so i can only assume that it s an expression of hate for the kind of people in it  and that s sad
