    i was a little disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there  yet it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the struggle its crew went through   i hope that cutting on my energy use will do  i don t know how else to shorten the distance polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals they cannot beat in their exhausted state   an inspiring film it is  but i didn t leave the cinema feeling very happy
