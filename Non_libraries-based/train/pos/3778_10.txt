the first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen  it was a bad version of  back to the future  with zero charm  once accepted that bill   ted are nitwits  the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks   this is a surprise  this is your only spoiler warning   by today s standards  this is more fun  this was shunned upon release  sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time  we get the photographer of  face off  the editor of  fugitive  a production designer from burton s early work  and the sound designer of  matrix   the writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep  since this was shunned by the fanbase and public  the director probably decided the style was too extreme  it s not  it fits the material  like  death becomes her  and  catch  this dares to be smart  but we like our movies  simple  so we don t buy it  probably since this dared to be different is why it took   producers to pull it off  what s so good    nice self reference towards keanu  from airhead to messiah  see also arnold schwarzenegger    joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts  he makes his own hatred  the evil b t and the  good robot usses  have the same vocabulary as their originals  lesser copies and depreciation of language    the  duality  motif  nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles  lots of high and low angles  they even use roy brocksmith from  total recall  to emphasize the point    the  choices  motif  i don t know where this started in the genre  maybe  ghostbusters  but it s used pretty well here  it even boils down to the   games against death battleship and club    film self reference  even present in the game against death  clue  this is smarter than tarantino or brooks  notice the premier magazine cover at the end   bill and ted  the movie  ironic also how death and nomolos were villains in the  die hard  and  lethal weapon  sequels   i still have some minor nits  but nothing compared to the original  music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former particularly in the teen market  carlin is a great comedian  but in these movies he s wasted  also  for all the daring this effort shows  even cracking gay jokes  they can t kill a cat   so  despite looking like a nickelodeon production  this is incredibly interesting  from this movie we got beavis and butt head   we re in heaven and we just mugged three people    final analysis     midrange material
