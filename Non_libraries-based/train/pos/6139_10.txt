a great movie  lansbury and tomlinson are perfect  the songs are wonderful  the dances  with a particular mention for the  portobello ballet  are gorgeous  as for the animated section  the match between animals has become an instant classic  the climax with the attack of the armatures is chilling and fascinating  i recommend to see the restored   minutes version or at least the   minutes video  here in italy we have only the   minutes version  although the film was presented in its original release at the running of   minutes  if possible  watch also the german videocassette  it was generated from the   minutes running but it s missing of every refer to world war ii and of all the scenes between english people and their nazi invaders
