 where the sidewalk ends   opens  appropriately  with dana andrews  and gene tierneys  names inscribed on the sidewalk  as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate  the sidewalk represents respectability  integrity and morality   only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter  but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion  and  when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end  sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one s shoes wet  mark dixon  dana andrews  was born in the gutter  his father a professional criminal  and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk  perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb  as a police detective  dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked  but he possesses a mean streak that he can t escape  when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead  dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised  a cheap criminal who ll cheat and lie to cover up his offence    where the sidewalk ends  was the only film to reunite dana andrews  gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb  laura   though the two films  as far as noir goes  couldn t be further apart  whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country house murder tale  this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama  given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt  it s unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused  occupying the typical niche of the pretty  helpless romantic interest  much as she did that same year in jules dassin s  the night and the city   andrews  on the other hand  has rarely been better  exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadn t expected of him  gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise  but he doesn t seem mean enough for the role  and i think that an actor like richard conte  who played mr  brown in  the big combo   would have better suited the character  i hadn t realised this  but conte appeared just one year earlier in preminger s  whirlpool    the tension  as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime  is absolutely riveting   certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era   though i feel that the situation still wasn t exploited to its full potential  the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator  but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs  had the witness been brought in as dixon was re enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance  we could have had some genuine fireworks  and why  for that matter  couldn t the taxi driver s testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor  tom tully  from suspicion of murder  niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht  who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard hitting cops and wise cracking felons  andrews  seething and implosive law enforcer  tormented by rage and remorse  has rarely been done better  at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas ray s  on dangerous ground
