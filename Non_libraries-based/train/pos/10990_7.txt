cypher is a clever  effective and eerie film that delivers  its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands  although one could immediately label the film a science fiction  there is a little more to it  it has it s obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story   the film  overall  plays out like it s some kind of nightmare  thus building and retaining a good atmosphere  we re never sure of what exactly is going on  we re never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we re not entirely sure of certain people  similar to having a dream   the ambiguity reigns over us all   hero included and i haven t seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before  bar terry gilliam s brazil  going with the eeriness stated earlier  cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective  noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there s something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well   there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story  the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster  liu  who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale  can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero  people whom appear as friends actually aren t  people who say they re helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look  despite a lot of switching things around  twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they re not carried out  the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu s character   and she s trying to help out  the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage  spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents  the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini cold war  something that resembles the u s a  and the u s s r  in their war of word s heyday and it really pulls through given the black  bleak  often cgi littered screen that i was glued to    what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations   significant then how the more he acts on his and foster s own motivation this sequence disappears because he s breaking away from the computerised  repetitive  controlled life that he s being told to live and is branching out   cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film  to say it resembles the first jason bourne film  only set in the sci fi genre  isn t cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities  despite them both being released in the same year  like i mentioned earlier  there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict  you will find yourself enjoying this film
