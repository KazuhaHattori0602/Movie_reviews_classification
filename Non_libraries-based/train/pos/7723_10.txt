a number of factors make it easy for me to state that i still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made  despite some of the acting  outdated dialogue etc   first  there is the scale of imagination in describing the krell  a humanoid race native to the planet  now all dead  who were   million years more advanced than earth humans us  and their technology  particularly the   cubic mile machine   second  there is the music and sound effects  which are inseparable from each other  it creates an eerie  unearthly feeling  unlike   which had traditional classical music   third  its  monster  is not only the most powerful and deadly ever envisioned  it s also based on real science and doesn t break the laws of physics and biology   finally  and most importantly  forbidden planet is the only movie ever made that attempts and  more incredibly  succeeds in making an honest  intelligent and mercilessly logical statement on the limits or ceiling of human  or any other biological entity s  development  no matter how long we survive as a species   in other words  it predicts our inevitable destiny
