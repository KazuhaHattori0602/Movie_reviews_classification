i hate over long over talky french movies  but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and talkiest french movie of them all  i saw it twice in the mid s  and then it disappeared  but i finally got to see it again in   and fell in love all over again  what is most remarkable is that it feels every bit as fresh today as it did   years ago  if you haven t seen it  don t miss your chance
