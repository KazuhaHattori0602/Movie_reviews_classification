i contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered  no one i know wanted to see this movie based on the previews  and everyone who actually saw it  that i know  absolutely loved it  the advertising campaign is disgrace disaster blunder   opened at   behind    rush hour  which i have not seen  average imdb score of     the bourn ultimatum  which i have seen  awesome movie but  rd week out  average imdb score of    deserving i would say    the simpsons movie  which i have seen  okay movie but  th week out  average imdb score of    a bit high in my opinion    stardust  average imdb score of    lower then bourn  but that s been our for   weeks   whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising i think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time  this should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytale
 too bad   anyway  now that i have very pointlessly ranted on and on  awesome movie  go see it
