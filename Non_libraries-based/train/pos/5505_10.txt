this is something new   there s a coup d etat and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it   a democratically elected president who uses his power to bring literacy to his people and encourages them to read the constitution is being slandered by the private media openly as dictator  mentally unstable  new hitler  etc  without repercussion from the governments side  like  say  silencing them via bullets and other traditional dictatorial methods  oh  and they still claim that they are being suppressed  of course   see how the media gloats about their own role in the coup d etat on tv after they toppled the government with the help of rouge generals  how much more stupid can you get     and see how the people of venezuela march to the palace  holding the constitution in their hands  and reinstall their elected government   this sounds like a hollywood fairytale  but it happened for real  against the explicit wishes of the usa  the documentary is a historical masterpiece  shot from the center of the action  acute and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup  the good  democratic  freedom loving  benevolent usa  who still channel large amounts of money to chavez  political opponents   also highly entertaining and exciting    points
