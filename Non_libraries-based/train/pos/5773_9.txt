since i am so interested in lake monsters i really dug this movie  this movie is worth a see  if you like the so awful they are good types of films check it out  the effects are really good as well just think  land of the lost  i originally watched this movie in the early  s maybe more like   on a local channel monster show called  morgus presents  i didn t scare me but i was   and anything b felt more like an a  years later i seen it on dvd at a local circuit city and bought it immediately so i can give it a   because it has a personal spot in my heart right there with the monster squad and gremlins  good b movie fun for all ages
