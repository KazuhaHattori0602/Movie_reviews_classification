okay  that was a pretty damn good episode  much better than the credit it receives   the camera work is splendid  best yet  i love that final shot  the atmosphere is fantastic  the costumes are great and the guest cast  minus the helpless victims  is strong    what i don t like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained  why does it change sex  what s the purpose  and they re aliens  what kind  why were they never shown again in the later mythology   i m giving this episode a high three stars  one of my favorites yet  but the plot holes bother me  still  not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
