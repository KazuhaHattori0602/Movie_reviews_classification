this film is a spicy little piece of film making from sam fuller which gives richard widmark the chance to show of some of his best  most edgy acting in the role of skip mccoy  a small time thief who stumbles onto a military secret while picking beautiful candy s  jean peters  pocket on a crowded bus  it turns out candy was doing a favor for her  ex boyfriend  who s working for the  commies   superficially  there s a mystery here regarding candy s motives and skip spends much of the film determining her motives
  actually he seems to just initially assume that she s a  commie  going so far as to pour beer in her face in a callous gesture  but the real question is   what s going on with skip  what are his motives  and why does candy like him so much  why do we  the audience  want to like him so much  basically what the film makers have done here is create a very striking  male fatale  in widmark s character and his performance  just as the male audience tends to ponder through the length of a film like  the big sleep  or  the glass key  along with the main characters whether the female character is trustworthy or just a pretty face  the film makers have here created a similar quandary for female viewers  widmark is handsome  and there s also a charm in his boyish insouciance   but the first two times he meets our leading lady  he robs her and then punches her in the face  eventually the question becomes   would skip sink so low as to sell out his country for a buck  his comments to the police  like  you re waving a flag at me  make us suspect he would  or is he simply out for revenge for the murder of his friend moe  thelma ritter  i m not sure that the film gives us a conclusive answer either way   thelma ritter s character work deserves special mention   she has created a truly indelible character here  fuller isn t afraid to give her plenty of  business    in the form of physical objects that she uses to draw the audience into her world  particularly her used ties  another example of fuller s  business  would be the scene with victor perry  an actor i ve seen elsewhere used to less effect  using the chopsticks to intimidate candy   the emphasis on moe s relationship with skip provides one of cinema s most revealing  honor among thieves  themes  in fact skip has the same kind of ease and the same kind of casual relationship with the police  with the notable exception of capt  tiger  murvyn vye  who has a grudge against him  i loved the scene where he invited the cops in by name and offered them a beer when they came to pick him up at his shack  those are the kind of details that make this film feel real   whether or not it really is  realistic  or whether that would matter are entirely separate questions   all told  i would say this is an essential crime film which displays a lot of the best and most durable attributes of the  film noir  school of film making  a predictable plot is off set by a host of colorful characters  uniformly well performed  cheap sets are disguised by the film s unrelenting pace  and the final product feels a lot more substantial than it probably is  this is the best film i ve seen so far by sam fuller and helps me to see better why he s regarded as a master director   here he accomplished some things that i think he tried but ultimately failed to do in other films like  the crimson kimono  and  shock corridor  as far as very emphatic acting styles and really gripping suspense  this is one of my favorite performances from widmark that i ve seen so far   and widmark was a talent that i m tempted to say  based on the few extraordinary films i ve seen with him  was comparable to that of alan ladd or humphrey bogart  although arguably he didn t make as many classic films
