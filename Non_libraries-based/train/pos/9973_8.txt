i really liked this version of  vanishing point  as opposed to the   version  i found the   version quite boring  if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times as i did with the   version  than to me  it is not all that great  of course  this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the   version was brought out  however  i have seen many remakes  where i have liked the original and older one better  i found that the plot of the   version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the   version  in my opinion  i felt the   version had more excitement and wasn t so  blase boring
