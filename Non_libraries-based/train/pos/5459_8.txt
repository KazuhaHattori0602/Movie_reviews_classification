baby face is a fast paced  wise cracking  knowing smirk of a film that  lasts only an hour and   minutes  but oh what a smart   minutes they  are  that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a  short time puts most of today s movie makers to shame  screenwriters of  today should study the economy of baby face and cut the bloat that  overwhelms so many of their films    the story is no nonsense  an amoral woman rises to wealth first under   and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her   sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming  happy ending   but it isn t hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to  go  so enjoy what s there and use your imagination for the rest  stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and douglass dumbvrille as a  hapless suitor  not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one  if  you ve never seen baby face catch it the next time it s shown on cable  or rent the cassette  it s worth the effort
