hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren t really interested in what puts protagonists into danger   only that they are in danger  and need to escape   this film proves hitchcock was not   correct  police believe jean simmons is guilty of a crime  when she plainly isn t  trevor howard decides their best course of action is to run for it  and so  the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains  buses and coaches   jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall   scrambling across dockyard roofs   all good exciting stuff   but i couldn t get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary  they should have stayed put   in other words  the macguffin wasn t strong enough
