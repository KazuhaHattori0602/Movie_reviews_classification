the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals  as many of his earliest pictures do  with a love triangle  at first glance  it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity themed morality comedies of cecil b  de mille  but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture  even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers  he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense   as well as being a student of the german expressionist style  the rhythmic editing style of sergei eisenstein had had its impact upon hitchcock  but here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery  this is apparent from the opening shots  where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo  and like eisenstein  the editing style seems to suggest sound   for example when a split second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in  we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring   there is also a contrast  particularly with silent films from the us  in that the ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards  as much as possible is conveyed by imagery  and hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters  speech  and it s not done by contrived symbolism or overacting  it s all done by getting the right angles and the right timing  particularly with point of view shots  as well as some strong yet subtle performances  there are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices  particularly double exposures  many of which were unnecessary  but there is far less of this than there is in the lodger   let s make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors  first up  the stunningly handsome and very talented carl brisson in the lead role  in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role  as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist  but that just goes to show how much i know  as it turns out brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting  playing his rival is the competent ian hunter  who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the  s  the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to lillian hall davis  torn between two lovers  she pulls it off very well however with an emotive  understated performance  and it s a shame her career never lasted in the sound era  and last but not least the great gordon harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role   the ring s climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent era hitchcock  martin scorcese may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull  as his watchword for these scenes was  stay inside the ring  the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots  but when the action intensifies hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it  with close ups and point of view shots  hitchcock s aim always seems to have been to involve his audience  and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character s fear or paranoia   the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the lodger  it s a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture  and probably the best of all his silent features
