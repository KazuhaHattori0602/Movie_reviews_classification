wwe armageddon  december       live from richmond coliseum  richmond  va   kane vs  mvp in an inferno match  so this is the fourth ever inferno match in the wwe and it is kane vs  mvp  wonder why was it the first match on the card  i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets mvp s ass on fire as they re on the apron and then mvp is running around the arena while yelling   eventually the refs put out the fire with a fire extinguisher as mvp sprawls around the entrance ramp  funny and visually quite entertaining ending     wwe tag team championship  this was originally supposed to be william regal   dave taylor vs  brian kendrick   paul london  c  in a regular tag team match  however  gm teddy long comes to the ring and announces that it s going to be a fatal  way tag team ladder match  mnm and the hardys are thrown in and it s all chaos  one word to describe this eye opener   wow  man  i really can t remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can t really do it justice  there was one particularly notable spot where the hardys set up a ladder in a see saw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held mnm for the kill  and then wham  nitro blew away while mercury apparently botched it and was bleeding like hell with lacerations over his face  he had to be taken away and nitro continued the match alone  another spot was when jeff powerbombed london while flipping off the ladder  there were other high flying breathtaking spots too many to remember  london finally unbuckles the belts to win this rave show stealer     the boogeyman vs  the miz  the two men get thrown in and around the ring until boogeyman explodes a sit out powerbomb for the victory and then and drools worms over the miz s mouth as usual    for this three minute incognito   united states championship  chris benoit  c  faces off chavo guerrero in yet another typical guerrero match  some good spots included a superplex off the top rope by chavo and an unusually long chain of german suplexes by benoit  vicki guerrero comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a sharpshooter or not  this allows chavo to go for a roll up but benoit rolls it up once more and chavo is locked in the sharpshooter  game over  nice hard fought battle albeit slow at times     wwe cruiserweight championship  gregory helms  c  vs  jimmy wang yang for this one  in a fairly moderate paced match  the match had some good high flying spots   most notably helms  moves off the top rope   but the crowd didn t seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match  and yang needs to get more airborne  helms won the match after blowing yang away with a facebuster on the knee     the undertaker vs  mr  kennedy in a last ride match  after a series of matches between these two  this time it is a last ride match  the second ever of its kind and the winner has to escort his opponent out of the arena in a hearse  pretty good indeed for what these two could offer  kennedy manhandled a good deal of taker and even broke free of a chokeslam to throw taker off the armageddon set about   feet below  and thank god for kennedy  otherwise it would ve been brutal  kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the hearse  i liked the camera view inside the hearse  taker then missed a steel pipe hurl on kennedy and broke the hearse s window instead  but then later busted kennedy open with a chair  and followed with a consecutive chokeslam and tombstone on the hearse s roof  kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the arena to win  i actually found myself really interested into these guys  willingness to take give real sick shots     santa comes into the ring  i go  what the hell  like many of the kids in the crowd  and then the word  lingerie contest  gets in my ear  break time   batista   john cena vs  finlay   king booker  talk about charisma vs  technicality  this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum rationally shifting from one team to the other and retaining good suspense  even finlay got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time  i kind of doubted his strength against the champs  and him and booker mainly didn t succeed in trying to cheat   except at one point where booker rammed his scepter into cena s throat  batista hits the bomb on booker for the win  didn t get to see the f u  cena performed the   knuckle shuffle anyhow and i think he also did the stfu  this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder    being an on and off wwe fan  i have to agree that armageddon was laced up with numerous eye catchers throughout  and the ladder match ultimately swallowed half of the show  the last ride match featured some fairly nerve wrenching spots  and the main event also did very well for its category  all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs  the miz bout and the ever useless lingerie contest  overall armageddon was a highly enjoyable pay per view and despite some big setbacks earlier in the ppv chronology  armageddon wishes this year s goodbye respectably  ppv rating
