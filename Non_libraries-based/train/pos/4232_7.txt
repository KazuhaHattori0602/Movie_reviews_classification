in all my   years of age  i have learned that when we watch a movie there is an identification  whether we want it or not  implicit with an specific character   sometimes because the character executes certain gesture  sometimes because the character speaks determinate word  or sentence   that we use or that we would like to use   in determinate situation   the movie in question  should be seen by this point of view  who now find a parking space   in a mall downtown  or in the street   taken by a car whose driver can t remember to think that he is not the only driver in the world   who hasn t the urge to  rubber out  the ill mannered spat   haven said that i ask    did you identify with della  played by kim bassinger  if your answer is  yes  then try not to find absurd details   comparatively with life s reality   in the movie  because you ll certainly find the movie ridiculous   abstractions made  you will see that the movie has moments of surprise  such as    in the sequence in which della grabs the box of tools in the trunk  does that box contains a gun  and does she haves the guts to use it    in the sequence in which terry dies whilst falling    in the sequence in which della gets attracted by chuckie s  mermaid s call   if you have already seen the movie  or if are planning seeing  keep in mind that there are  realistic  movies   fiction  movies   political  movies  and movies in which you can  wash your soul 
 to exemplify the last one  we can quote   tropa de elite   according to newspaper s   there was unanimous applause when bope officials take certain attitudes   as i have seen the movie in dvd  i could not ascertain the audience s reaction
