when people think of downtown chicago they think of walter payton  ditka and  da bears  ryne sandberg  the white sox breaking the curse in   or the immortal michael jordan and his six championships  and finals mvp s  with the chicago bulls  rarely in this generation do people think of the struggling side of chicago  the ghettos  the drug infested streets and life in the urban housing projects during the  s   one of television s most formidable shows ever and a groundbreaking sitcom was  good times  which i remember vaguely as a small child on cbs  and i enjoy regularly now on tv land    good times  was another norman lear classic  the producer that gave us  the jeffersons  the best african american sitcom of all time and  all in the family  the greatest show of all time   good times  brought out the hardships of the ghetto and the urban housing projects  and did so with charm  well written and thoughtful plots  and some wonderful acting especially by the matriarch and patriarch of this struggling ghetto family played by esther rolle and john amos  the children in the supporting cast were also pretty good especially the ever popular janet jackson in her early years and ralph carter as florida and james evans youngest son whose character at a young age realizes that life is unfair  and he has to learn to stand on his own two feet   the eldest of the children j j  played by jimmy walker is somewhat out of place on this show and is there mainly for comic relief  his emotional age is about   or   even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties  j j  gets annoying  and it is a credit to the often nasty james evans  amos  that he never tells j j  to get his own life  get a job and get out of the house  j j  is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree  or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status   two classic episodes of good times was the one where the janet jackson character is running a fever of   and florida evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can t afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn t want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to  the other episode is the one where james evans can t afford the rent a paltry low   a month  the evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks  being thrown out of the projects with no where to go  florida evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family  but the government doesn t consider her family poor because they have over   in assets for a family of five which is unfairly but unfortunately legally over the poverty line  james and the kids want to hustle for the money  but florida is a person of great moral character and doesn t want to do anything dishonest no matter how dire their predicament is  in the end the family does find a solution to keep their heads above water    good times  a classic show from the  s is about keeping you re head above water in a cruel world  james and florida evans both work hard in menial jobs to try to bring their children up right and avoid the social stigma of welfare  i was too young to understand the message of the sitcom as a toddler in the  s in its first airing on cbs  but i really enjoy the reruns on tv land in    good times  is one of the classic sitcoms from back in the day
