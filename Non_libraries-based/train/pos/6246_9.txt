it s not a brilliant idea to watch hundstage if you re not   sure of your mental stability  because it will be severely tested with this film no matter how sane you are  i have to say hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film  so the majority of the viewers wouldn t have the level of  maturity  to reach in to its delightful side  kind of like tarkovsky films  but different in a way  i  myself  can t say i had a lot of fun watching it  but it s an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich  that hollywood offers  hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over  you can t simply sit back and watch it  you ll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film  a film that s similar to this in style is nachtgestalten  but it was considerably better  and way less violent  this one for instance  is not for children or those who are mentally tender or bad tempered  most viewers would most likely give either a   or a   to this film  i give it a   because i ve seen the multiple stories in one film phenomenon in another film and it was better  but this one s an outstanding piece on its own  worth watching  but get ready to see something disturbing
