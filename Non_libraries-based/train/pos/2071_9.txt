for those of us baby boomers who arrived too late on the scene to appreciate james dean et  al  martin sheen showed us the way in this great feature   the premise is easy enough  cool hood meets small town sheriff and all hell ensues  but the nuts and bolts of this movie enthrall the car nut in all of us    no  this isn t casablanca  nor is it great literature  but it is a serious movie about cars  rebellion  and the genius that is martin sheen   enjoy this and appreciate it for what it is  and for what martin will become  i loved this movie growing up as a teen in the  s  and you will too
