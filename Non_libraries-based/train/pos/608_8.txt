going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea  especially a romantic fantasy   little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic  everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection   claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie  from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character   michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty   robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax   overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan  if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike  stardust is the way to go
