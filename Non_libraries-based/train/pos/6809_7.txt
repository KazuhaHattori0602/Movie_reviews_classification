this was a pretty good film  i m not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment  but i didn t want to take a chance  anyway  near the end of the film  the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory  i can t remember the first passage he reads  but the second one is genesis   he says it s genesis   but he actually quotes verse   this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment  it s too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today  did anybody ever hear of john jay  the first supreme court justice in the history of this country  he said that the bible is the best of all books  too bad we ve lost that view in america
