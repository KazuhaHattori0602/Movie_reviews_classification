i was worried that my daughter might get the wrong idea  i think the  dark heart  character is a little on the rough side and i don t like the way he shape shifts into a  mean  frog  fox  boy
 i was wrong  this movie was made for my kid  not for me  she  gets it  when it went over  under  my head  of course i don t  get it  this isn t one of the new kids movies that adults will also enjoy  this is straight for the young ones  and the crew knew what they were doing  there isn t any political junk ether  there s no magic key that will save the world from ourselves  nobody has the right to access excess  and everyone isn t happy all the time  and as a side benefit  nobody dies   russwill
