any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry   aside from that  the film is really an old fashioned love story boy meets girl boys loses girl boy gets girl back   the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt  general webster riccardo montalban is a close second my question would be how did he ever get to be a  star general the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates  it s a wonder they show him any respect at all   brando s southern accent is a little overdone  and some scenes have a few holes but overall  i enjoy the film every time i see it   red buttons is great i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles as in button s case  often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor
