 as i was when i saw this movie  i will never watch this movie again  not because it is a bad movie  but because it scared me so much  as i said  i was   when my english teacher decided to show it to us  the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book   all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd s bed  although  just before that there is something that also frightened us  which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow  and he hears a child s voice say  it s for you  that scene still haunts me to this day  nearly   years after i saw the film   if you are easily scared  avoid this film
