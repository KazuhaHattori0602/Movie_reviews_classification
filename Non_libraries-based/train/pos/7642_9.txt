not really a big box office draw  but i was pleasently surprised  with this movie  james  i did some things to farrah fawcett  orr   co wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary  average guy  named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been  incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game  when he was   but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender  mike  larry gets his wish  yet soon realizes that his new life  isn t exactly as he hoped it would be   i must say  this movie really impressed me  critics have given  it mixed  and i must say the concept is really interesting and  pulled off well  yes  it is a little standard  but packs enough  funny moments  drama and excellent acting to make it really  good  james belushi  i think  was oscar worthy for his role  jon  lovitz is perfect  and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in  their roles  michael caine is perfect as the bartender  it s  just a good movie with a good lesson  if you ve never seen  i  highly recommend you check
