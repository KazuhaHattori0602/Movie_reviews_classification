this was a very thought provoking film  especially for   at the time it was actually a huge box office success  after the  s it appeared to be forgotten  but its central messages were too important to disappear completely it was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time no one had ever heard of the  greenhouse effect before   and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up   the sets and special effects might look a little outdated  but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period  if you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense  this is a message movie  not for zonked out star wars fans that cant sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions   this was also hestons last good film  the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy  after that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash  this might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made  and the ending might be creepy and depressing  but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this
