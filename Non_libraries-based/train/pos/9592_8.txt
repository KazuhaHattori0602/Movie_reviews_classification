this film came out   years years ago  and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york  the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses  anthony slide s  great pretenders  says nothing  julian fleisher s  the drag queens of new york  an illustrated field guide  with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge  minette  the warhol queens  and the  s club scene   and postdates the film   ignores the houses completely  even laurence senelick s  the changing room    the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it   i understand from the film itself and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades  the major film performance by a house member prior to   seems to be chrystal la beija in  the queen    the historical context is the biggest missing part of  paris is burning   the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored  it is a valuable snapshot of life in   the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending  but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real life murder  as we now know  dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet  but this did not come out until three years later   of historical importance  but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context
