the most hillarious and funny brooks movie i ever seen  i can watch and re watch the tape   times  i laugh my a  off and i cry on some moments  it is really good and funny movie  and if you like brooks   this is a must  in short   brooks  billionare  gets to the streets as homeless for   days in order to win the entire poor district from his competitor  the reality bites  but in the end   it is about warm relations between humans  hightly recommend
