 the gingerbread man is the first thriller i ve ever done    robert altman   in   charles laughton directed  the night of the hunter  a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer  one of the film s more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat  the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster    seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in  cape fear  another film set in the american south  that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat  in   martin scorsese  trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream  remade  cape fear  boat scene and all   now we have robert altman s  the gingerbread man  another slice of small town southern gothic  altman says he consulted  the night of the hunter  for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to  spread his wings and try a popcorn picture  but what he s secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre   so instead of a showdown on small boat  we get a showdown on a giant ship  instead of two kids being kidnapped  we get two kids being safely returned to the police  instead of money being hidden  we have money being readily given via a last will and testament  instead of the righteous attorney of the   film and the deplorable attorney of the   remake  we get a rather three dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh  instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys  instead of the monster breaking into the family s house boat  we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster s  house ship  similarly  instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall     etc etc etc   altman goes on and on  reversing everything just a little slightly  pulling at the edges and doing his own thing  his touch is most apparent during the film s first half hour  the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot driven movie storytelling and altman s fondness for overlapping dialogue  casual narratives  prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren t so much introduced as they are simply part of what s going on   still  despite altman s best intentions  the film never rises above mediocrity  altman s too bound to the conventions of the  thriller format  to do much damage  his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre   gingerbread man  is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller   the film s not a complete waste  though  robert downey junior  kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah  all turn in juicy performances  the film also has a nice atmosphere  set against a approaching hurricane  and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns  while it s not the complete disaster that scorsese s  cape fear  was  the film still never amounts to anything special       in the late  s altman made   successive films set in the american south   kansas city   gingerbread man  and  cookie s fortune  unlike  gingerbread man  both  kansas city  and  cookie s fortune  tackle the genre on the broader  more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with     kansas city  is the more important of these two films  its hierarchies of class  politics and crime  and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks  would prove influential on all serious  st century film crime writers  see  for example   the wire  that said   cookie s fortune  while a much slighter tale  is perhaps the better picture   note  altman claims that this is his first thriller  but he directed  images  an art house thriller  in    worth one viewing
