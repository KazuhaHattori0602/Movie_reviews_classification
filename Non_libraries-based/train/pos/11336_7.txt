answer  despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman  your ex is creepier  nastier  and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth   the acting in this independent film actually is quite good  despite the less than wonderful script  it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten  clich d line and make it sound vaguely believable  young anthony de marco  as jake  puts in a particularly good performance   fortunately  the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog  try it  especially if you re not a monster fan  this is not a horror flick  even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous  and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film   jake s closet  is suitable for mature adults   the whole  this time  is much better than the sum of its parts
