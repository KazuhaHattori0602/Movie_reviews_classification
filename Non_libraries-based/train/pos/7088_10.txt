terry gilliam s and david peoples  teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the  s  people s proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time   i especially love the idea one can t change the past  it s a nice counterpoint to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise   biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness  gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness  perfection and originality   the story itself is engaging  one man  james cole  played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance  travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that s wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground  with the information he ll collect  scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface  but because their time travelling technology isn t perfect  he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things  and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists  end of the millennium paranoia  biological weapons  the perception of reality  and the definition of sanity  with such a complex movie  it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess  but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas   i watched this movie once around   years ago  it marked me a lot  i remember still thinking about many days after wards  for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important  i ve re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and it s better than i remembered it  brad pitt still steals all the scenes he s in  playing jeffrey goines   almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club   a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist ideas who s also crazy and  according to cole  perhaps responsible for the virus  the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie  pitt s eyes  voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he s really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands  pitt s oscar nomination was well deserved  surprising was also bruce willis  performance  his i didn t remember very well  but it s beautiful and full of sensibility  he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground  and when he comes to the past you ll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up  cole is a rather ambiguous character  peoples  tried to imbue some darkness in him  and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself  the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked  ironically cole didn t start as a crazy character  but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world  he s considered mad and convinced it s all in his mind  until he arrives at a point when he can t distinguish past from future  reality from fiction  willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure  and it works perfectly  one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole s shrink  dr  kathryn railly  finds undeniable proof he s really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world  the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace  their relationship is also well handed  although perhaps a bit compressed for time s sake  but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past  but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport  wrapping all the pieces together  which will blow many minds away   there are two great endings in this movie  a twist in the sense of se en or fight club  and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who s just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who s witnessing his future self die  the two share a brief look  and she smiles at him  the twist is brilliant  but i prefer this ending for emotional impact  madeleine stowe is very good playing dr  railly  she drew many different emotions from me in her performance  the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can t be changed  this movie shows that in a terrifying way  it reminds me of chinatown in that sense  the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help  railly s character shares that fatalism  the more she tries to help cole   first dealing with his  madness  then helping him in his mission   the more they re sucked into tragedy   the twist ends with a hopeful note  though  with the feeling cole s mission hasn t been in vain  twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained  it s not supposed to be art  although it s more artists than many artistic movies  it s an unpretentious movie where all elements  from music to editing to costume design  etc  came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece
