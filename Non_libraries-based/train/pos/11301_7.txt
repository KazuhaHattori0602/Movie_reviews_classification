audiences today will probably watch a film like ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out  the structure of the film really divorces from sap happy hollywood conventions as well as other major theatrical elements  it relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light  films of this nature the neo realist films were made to reflect the darkness felt during post world war ii times  ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war  including  adultery  conspiracy  murder  pregnancy  etc  aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments  the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty  shot on location  uses natural lighting and most likely non popular actors  all of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film  yielding the following theme  negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally   the two leads gino and giovanna are polar opposites  yet both carry the mentality  we re bored and we want to be entertained  gino is a drifter  a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations  giovanna is a bored house wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence  she doesn t want to leave her home and husband  but would rather remain where she is because it s safer  gino s lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle giovanna craves  the only difference is that she s too afraid to live it herself that s why she falls in love with gino  he represents everything she wants but doesn t have the courage to get  she wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husband gino is the perfect ticket into that world  the affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the  s feeling somewhat uneasy  i mean  films prior to the neo realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before  to say the least it was probably a bit alarming   in conjunction with the theme  the neo realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior  succinctly put  adulterous behavior  as shown in the film  leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives  when gino and giovanna conspire with each other to  eliminate  giovanna s husband  karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done  they return to their home  the atmosphere is dark and biting  as can be expected from the neo realist style  they are not happy  they re actually more depressed  they thought that by eliminating giovanna s husband that they d live happier lives  but they were duped  the film ends with giovanna s death it being in karmic similitude of her husband s death  i think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons  here s why   there s a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen  and if so  to what extent  i think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified  but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have  as the subtext of ossessione asks  is adultery and murder evil  i think the film eagerly responds yes  the adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are  ironically though  towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other s arms inside the car  the author of the film shows that their happiness is  in fact  a fa ade  the car crashes off the cliff and into the river  killing giovanna  the police arrest gino  i think it was the author s intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior  in the end karma will come back to haunt them  i agree  i think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfish always wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times  this was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that gino and giovanna experience in their relationship  he can t handle the pressure of living in giovanna s husband shadow  so he leaves giovanna and sleeps with another girl  such is typical of the insatiable  hedonistic personality   all in all  the film seemed very risky for its time  the audience  however  was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought  those pre war  happy go lucky films were no longer being believed  movie going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters  they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so called  sin  because it was a reflection of their own life problems  ossessione  then  acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading  that is  a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo realist film movement
