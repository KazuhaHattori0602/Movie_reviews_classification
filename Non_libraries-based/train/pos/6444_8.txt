the line  of course  is from the lord s prayer    thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven  sweden  especially its far north  is not my idea of heaven   degree c winter temperatures are a little on the low side for me  but the good folk who live there no doubt think they are in god s own country   the storyline here is a familiar one  acclaimed international musician daniel suffers health breakdown in mid career  goes back to the little village in northern sweden where he was born  persuaded by the local pastor to help out with the church choir  he turns some unlikely talent into a class act  and they enter a contest held in innsbruck austria  there are echoes  sorry  of the band players of  brassed off  the models of  calendar girls  and the dancers of  the full monty  but of course he causes plenty of emotional upheaval as some of the more downtrodden villagers realise their worth and revolt against their oppressors  he faces hostile husbands and an increasingly dubious pastor  but nothing except death is going to stop him   despite the somewhat corny story  we get to know and like many of the characters  who come across as people rather than caricatures despite many of them being recognisable  types  i did wonder about the wife beater being unpunished for so long   sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty strongly discouraged  he was also a bit young to be one of the bullies of daniel s youth  and the puritanical pastor with a secret passion for girlie magazines was a bit of a stereotype  but marvellously realised by niklas falk   michael nyqvist is simply wonderful as daniel  the frail but driven musician  and there s some nice music as well  i was rapt for the whole two hours  the ending is what you make of it  i guess  but it s not spoiling it to say daniel achieves what he set out to do
