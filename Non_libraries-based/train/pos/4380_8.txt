this is a very good  under rated action drama and slightly historical movie   the basic story concerns rob roy s borrowing of   pounds  its theft  and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clansmen   cunningham  tim roth  is an amazing villain and character in this story  brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil   rob roy  liam neeson  is excellent too  but i think the writers used the word  honour    too many times   the rest of the cast is strong  and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed   the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic  but not too gory  the story is good and you really want rob to win   all in all just shy of a classic
