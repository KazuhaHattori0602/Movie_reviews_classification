if you enjoy cleese   all the british  pythonesque  humour of the time  then this little gem is absolutely hilarious   arthur lowe is a real treat   i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out  and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for   years  and will do forever  i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated   perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously   i can t believe it is now only available in the us  ntsc of course  and not in uk  where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour
