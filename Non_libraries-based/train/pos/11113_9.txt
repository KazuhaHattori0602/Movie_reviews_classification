i ve only watched the first series on dvd  but would summarise the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script  the series is as good as goodfellas and casino  and almost as good as the godfather  hence not a   and far better than any of guy ritchie s efforts  although there s plenty of action  some of it pretty bloody  the story is character driven  even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines  e g  the priest s relationship  or lack of  with carmilla and the restaurateur s wife  and christopher and his dimwit friend  who didn t last very long  a darwin award nominee   apart from the plot  the script and the acting  the other reasons i liked it     it made me want to visit new jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce    the music    it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
