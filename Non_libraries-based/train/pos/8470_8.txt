a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure   the crown of the queen of sheeba  from egypt  the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco  but it won t be an easy journey  there are plenty of would be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown  fortunately for all involved  mr  moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey  however  that doesn t mean someone won t try to get their hands on the treasure   after the disappointment of mr  moto s gamble  i went into mr  moto takes a vacation hoping for the best  but  admittedly  fearing the worst  but within the first   seconds of the film  i knew i would find it more enjoyable  i m a sucker for a  s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt  and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist  imagine that  peter lorre playing a german  the beginning scenes really drew me in  while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco  it remained just as enjoyable  dark  sinister characters lurking in the rainy night  gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero s head  sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them  and master criminals believed to be dead   these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good  s mysteries that i love  and mr  moto takes a vacation s got  em all  a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role  comic relief from g p  huntley that s actually funny  and a return to form for mr  moto  i ve already mentioned his disguise in the movie s opening scenes  well the athletic moto comes out near the film s finale  moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey  all this and i haven t even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre  any way you look at it  mr  moto takes a vacation is a winner   as much as i hate that the mr  moto series had to end after this installment  it s understandable when you think about it  wwii was just around the corner  and after pearl harbor  a movie with a japanese hero wouldn t have gone over very well  at least the mr  moto series ended on a very positive note
