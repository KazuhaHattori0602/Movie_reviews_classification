richard brooks  the last hunt was a film star stewart granger couldn t even stand to hear mentioned   he even tore up a vintage poster for the film when presented it for signing in his later years   but then the director did run off with his wife  so it s understandable  for anyone else this is one of the best of the adult westerns of the  s  and years ahead of its time in its attitude to the environment   in many ways it plays almost like a sequel to one of anthony mann s westerns that see their heroes dragged to their redemption kicking and screaming against it every step in the way  here granger s legendary buffalo hunter has already seen the light but  after a buffalo stampede costs him his herd of cattle in a fit of poetic justice  he s dragged back into the darkness by robert taylor s callous and proudly racist gunslinger  justifying it on the grounds that  i ve already got the guilty conscience  i might as well have the money as well  raised by indians  he s fully aware of the damage he s doing as the disappearing buffalo heads for extinction  and he gradually becomes almost as consumed with self loathing as taylor is with hate  when the two men fall out over debra paget s squaw   the sole survivor of a band of indians taylor kills   and a white buffalo hide that s priceless to the hunters and the indians for very different reasons  a showdown becomes inevitable  though the outcome certainly isn t   taylor s is certainly ironic casting   it was granger turning down many of the epic roles mgm developed for him in films like quo vadis and ivanhoe that gave taylor his  s comeback after years of steady decline  his hair color may not convince but his performance does  a shallow and violent man so consumed with hate that he doesn t wear a gun  the gun wears him  granger s accent isn t always convincing  but he makes a good quiet hero in the jimmy stewart mold  trying to keep hold of his newfound decency and reconcile his actions with his beliefs before finally getting a chance to make amends  russ tamblyn s halfbreed skinner and lloyd nolan s one legged old timer also give as good as they get  but the real star is the script  tightly plotted with an excellent eye and ear for character   not to mention an ending stanley kubrick borrowed for the shining   it balances historical revisionism with entertaining drama without ever selling either short  the new french dvd is extras free but does boast a   transfer with an english soundtrack
