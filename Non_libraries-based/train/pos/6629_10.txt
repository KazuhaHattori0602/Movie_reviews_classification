the best treasure island ever made  they just don t make films  like this anymore  or ever  no one makes films like this  more  than a novelty  this film is funny  frank and fascinating  yet moody   mysterious and morose  this is one of my favorite pictures  the  director must have had some idea what it is all about  but he  certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations  while leaving little left to the imagination  why he  has not made more films like this  i have no idea  while  reminding me of some of the best noir  it is one of a kind  but this  is not for the lazy or simple
