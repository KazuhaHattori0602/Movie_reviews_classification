prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and  happy vibes  what with stories of fights  chaos  murder and of course extreme male bonding  but the prison in this film is a different beast altogether  horror films set in cells are  as you probably know  nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape   two of the greatest themes in horror cinema  with such examples as the chair  waldermar korzeniowsky    the green mile  frank darabont    alien    david fincher   and of course the entire women in prison exploitation genre itself  another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised  or at least that s what you d have thought  prison is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it s somewhat of a shame that it isn t as well known as it should be   the film  in short  centres on an old prison  well  duh  which has been reopened  however  it s not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear  but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind  death  and boy  are we treated to some awesome death scenes  i won t spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands   besides the special effects and the murders  this film also has another thing going for it  it s cast  headlining  we have lord of the rings  peter jackson    star viggo mortensen  and for all those so inclined  yes  he does get naked  whose performance is not only highly believable  but is done with such skill that his eastwood esquire character is both bad to the bone and likable  a very delicate mix  add him to a cast of  hey wait a minute i know that guy  actors and you ve got yourself one great set of stars  the characters themselves however lack three dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical  we ve got a black oculist  a hard as nails prison warden  a human rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters  but in all honesty  this  fault  actually aids the film  instead of boring character development in an over long equilibrium  we are chucked  more or less  straight into the action and once it gets going  very early on  there s not a single scene that s a filler   it s balls to the wall plot  unlike a certain shawshank redemption  frank darabont      sharing conventions with the slasher genre  this is somewhat of a convention itself  and  in good ol  slasher genre tradition  prison punishes those who have been bad   all in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world  with an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans  don t be fooled into thinking it ll be a cheesy little film either  just because it was made in usa  s  it s far from cheesy  although the very end does ruin this  and  simultaneously  far from gritty and realistic  whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape  these are rather subtly done   i give it   out of   luvs  a very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
