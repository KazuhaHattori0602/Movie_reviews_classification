fact  stargate sg  is a cheesy sci fi tv series   there s no escaping facts  how much you try to excuse yourself or explain it stargate sg  remains a cheesy sci fi tv series   stargate sg  does borrow and steal ideas briskly  special fx aren t nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn t going to blow you out of the chair  or couch for that matter either   but  and this is where i really think stargate sg  deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea i think you can count at least one cheesy sci fi movie that s actually worse than a one hour tv episode   in fact some episodes actually could probably have been   minutes long and still have been better than most movies   and being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes stargate sg  special   i am very picky with my selections  i follow perhaps one or two tv series at most and i hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when i found myself caught   so for those who decide to brush of stargate sg  as yet another tacky sci fi show  don t  stick with it and you ll see what i m talking about
