  i saw once no man s land     imdb link     and found it ok  the film is about a guy who steals only porsches  gone in sixty seconds comes   years after and adds nothing to it  in fact  it has a lot of scenes that are worthless  and the ending is very  very bad   the sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used
