it was on at  am  too close to school to see very often  the animation   computer graphics were spectacular for the time  the idea of cowboys   ordinary people casually throwing around space vehicles   robots was amazing  maybe it inspired treasure planet   unfortunately  it s really boring in the dvd format  the shows are all basically identical  when viewing non sequential episodes on a dvd  you re stoned by disk   by today s standards  the animation is spotty  we don t notice the computer graphics anymore and focus on how corny the characters are instead   the bright spots are the heroine characters  they were a lot more believable  took themselves more seriously than modern heroines  and weren t corny  they actually saved men
