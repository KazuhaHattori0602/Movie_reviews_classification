a great film  slow  yes    but original  deeply atmospheric  dark and horrifying  perfectly surreal  feels like a nightmare   i d compare it to david lynch  eraserhead  inland empire  blue velvet  style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton fink and naked lunch  insects  also a bit of jodorowsky  fando y lis   add some night on earth  angel heart and a bit of begotten  pi   would it be wrong to mention tetsuo  jacob s ladder  barker s the forbidden and salome   that should form together at least the concept of a dark night  nuit noire   if you re out for avantegardistic and or surrealistic cinema  like i am  you re gonna like this one  if you re expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot   try your luck with something else   final words  the plot is very  very strange and unusual and that s probably the   reason why most people who don t appreciate this film hate it
