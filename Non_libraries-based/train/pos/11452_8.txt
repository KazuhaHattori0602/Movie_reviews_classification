the scottish artist andy goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks  assembling rocks into egg shaped cairns  filling riverside rock pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns  an original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of southampton art gallery  near where i live  but although i found these pieces intriguing  i only realised the wonder of goldsworthy s work when i was lucky enough to catch a re screening of rivers and tides   thomas reidelsheimer s film  accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by fred frith  brings goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work  the opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake like thread set atop a tree stump  working with his teeth and bare hands  goldsworthy crafts a beautiful  ephemeral work  before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant nova scotian sunlight  this scene is among the most beautiful in the film  but the breadth and inventiveness of goldsworthy s work is remarkable  reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures  capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine  even if for just a few hours  minutes or seconds   goldsworthy himself provides the narration  speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work  he makes plain his need to work with nature  to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials  even when they seem to be working against him  at times he is down to earth and humorous  at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose   something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand  the  rivers and tides  of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist s hands  flowing from one form to the next  the capture of the creation and dissolution of goldworthy s work is in itself a striking piece of art   although goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across north america and europe  the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting  it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that i get when i spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new  a brief interval in which we are introduced to andy s family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks  nevertheless  reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing goldsworthy and his creations  locating them in their wider environments  from meandering canadian rivers to rainy scottish hillsides  fittingly  the film ends with goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky  fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air  this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
