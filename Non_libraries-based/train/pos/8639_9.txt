i have to start off by apologizing because i thought the first   of this film was hilarious  it s mostly because of brad pitt s performance  spot on   the acting by all involved was quite good but brad stole the movie  the atmosphere was perfect in all respects  i m not a giant pitt fan but this has got to be one of his best roles ever   brutal honest gritty  all good words to describe this movie   i was reading a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind early s violence isn t explained  it is explained but they thankfully don t have to go into graphic detail to get their point across   overall i gave this a   because every scene bar   or   was effective  i think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie  underrated
