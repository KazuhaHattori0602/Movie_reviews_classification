this was a favorite christmas special that i wish that they would release on vhs or dvd   since my   rpm got lost and any cassettes i made are also long gone   i am not even a big john denver fan but was very impressed with the music   which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin   esp little st  nick     it also contained a few little known songs   original      even though it was done at the end of the  s this show had a timeless feel to it  hoping to find a copy soon
