it has only been a week since i saw my first john waters film  female trouble  and i wasn t sure what to expect the second time around   while the previous film was outrageously over the top  pecker is actually a funny film that satirizes the art critics in new york to a t  anyone who cannot imagine what these  experts  find so appealing about modern art  will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs get so full of themselves over pecker  a boy who just found a broken camera and starts shooting his friends and neighbors   edward furlong  pet sematary ii  terminator   judgment day  was surprisingly good as pecker  there wasn t a lot of meat on any of the roles in this film  but he really shines   christina ricci  prozac nation  comes in with another great performance as pecker s girlfriend  in fact  it was a banner year for ricci  buffalo   the opposite of sex  and pecker   lili taylor  who had the only good role in the haunting  was also a significant part of the film and really made it enjoyable   there are many funny scenes  but i have to say the best was when a crown gathers screaming   we want bush   we want bush   we want bush  i thought it was a republican convention until i saw the police hauling off the dancer   i am going to have to look for more of waters  work  especially hairspray  now that that is in the news
