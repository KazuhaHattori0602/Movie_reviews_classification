erich rohmer s  l anglaise et le duc  makes a perfect companion piece to peter watkins   la commune  paris   both films  screened at this year s toronto international film festival  ironically illustrate how history is shaped to by the tellers of the tale  ironic  given the tragic events that were taking place in the u s  during the festival   set in paris during the french revolution  the movie  based on grace elliott s  lucy russell   memoirs  is a first hand account of how she survived those heady but dangerous days  she also details her relationship with the duke of orleans  played by jean claude dreyfus  who  in contrast to herself  is a supporter of the revolution   true to form  you don t know whose side of history rohmer is going to come down on  one of the earliest of the french  new wave  filmmakers  rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative  after all  in the midst of the rebelling youth viet nam days of the late  s and  s  he was filming romantic little confections like  claire s knee  but don t sell the old boy short  folks  he s always been a student of human nature  not an ideologue  and  l anglaise et le duc  continues to bear this out   rohmer s characters are never the  bad guys  nor the  good guys  they are first and foremost human beings who are capable of exhibiting a full range of human potentialities  and limitations  that s why his movies are always provocative  and this film is no exception   now for the technological nuts and bolts   rohmer  though making his way into his  s  is still on the cutting edge of cinematic innovation  the look of  l anglaise  is like something you ve never seen before  you guessed it  the old guy  like several of the festival s directors this year  has gone digital   all of the movie s exterior scenes look as though they are taking place in their original  s parisian settings  as a matter of fact  you may get so distracted from marveling at the authenticity of the film s look you may have to go back for a second screening to catch the subtleties of the film s psychological  and yes  i ll say it  political insights   toronto features some of the world s edgiest young filmmakers this year  as well as some of the world s oldest  and the old masters are standing there on cinema s cutting edges right alongside the young ones   long live youth  long live old age  and long live erich rohmer
