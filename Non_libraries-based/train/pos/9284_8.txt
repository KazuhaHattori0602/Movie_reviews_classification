this film is being described as a comedy  but it wasn t a comedy at all  like any panahi film  it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy  but it was very funny  much lighter than the director s dark and serious the circle  my favourite iranian film  the resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable  as if it were a documentary  and completely hilarious   the filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing  it added a realism much like australia s kenny  of course a very different film   the performances from all the non professional actors   soldiers and girls   were very credible  it was very moving to see the passion  disappointment and excitement of these girls  anyone in this country who thinks muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film   it will be a real eye opener   to me  the soldiers represented the current paradigm  they started out with stock standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls  as the film progressed  they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance  when what seems like all of teheran breaks out into wild celebration  everyone is caught up in it  and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all   it was a very moving and unexpected ending  and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions  frivolity  drama and social commentary  though it s adult cinema  i think mature minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film  as long as they can read subtitles   it is remarkable that a repressive country like iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of panahi and kiarostami  perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful  australian  and other  film makers could take a leaf out of their book
