i just saw this delightful japanese feature film at the  th annual roger ebert overlooked film festival in the historic virginia theatre in champaign  illinois   although this film  subtitled in english  has ballroom dancing as its heart  the film actually shows the world outside of japan how the rigid structures of family  employment  salaryman  and recreation still exist in modern day japan   writer director suo masauki [i follow japanese custom of presenting the family name  last name  first and the given name  last ] uses the not so very popular theme of ballroom dancing to show the societal structure of japan    [also  i shall not use the movie character names when world readers may not be familiar with japanese formal names which may confuse  i will refer to the  actors by their professional acting name as listed in the internet data movie base ]   he enlists the aid of his real life wife  professional ballet dancer kusakari tamiyo in her first and  so far  only motion picture  she is a dance teacher at her father s dance studio  yet  her real ambition is to compete once more in an international dance competition which she was disqualified from in the past  no  i won t say  why  see the movie   salaryman yakusyo koji is the main star of the film  a veteran of about   films since   he gives a sterling performance of a  s something companyman  who has a lovely wife  teenage daughter  and just purchased the house of his  longing   and  yet  something is missing from his own inner happiness  see this film to learn how he becomes  involved  with ballroom dancing and secretly goes to  lessons  most of the dancing characters are liberated from the traditional  japanese hierarchy of social structure  they are friendly and warm and inviting  of course  this is in sharp contrast to how japanese society is structured with it s  place for everyone and everyone in its place  philosophy   the movie has so many funny moments  the almost   theater goers broke  into spontaneous laughter during many of the comedic moments  this proves  that comedy has no foreign language    veteran actor takenaka naoto is funny and brilliant as well as watanabe eriko  they are two funny character actors   one could purchase and read a college text book regarding the structure of life in japan  or  you could watch this fine film and begin to understand how the  people of japan grow up in a fairly rigid societal structure  watching the movie  shall we dansu  is a quick immersion into further study and viewing other  japanese films    i recommend this film to all  it s funny  it s charming  it will make you cry a little  and it will warm your heart
