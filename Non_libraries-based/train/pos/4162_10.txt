yeah  it is  in fact  it s somewhere in my top   all time favorite movies  number   i think  anyways  i m usually not one for plots  but i think plots work better in anime and rpg video games   final fantasy   for example  and not movies  but this one has it all  vivid drawings of planets  stars  an extremely well written screenplay  while this is not really for children  they can still watch it  it contains no graphic blood  guts and silicone  but i don t think they re going to understand it
