i remember watching this in the  s   then i have just recently borrowed a couple of episodes from our public library   with a nearly   year hiatus  i have come to another conclusion  most of the principals interviewed in this series   some at the center of power like traudl junge  hitler s secretary karl doenitz  head of germany s navy  anthony eden  uk    are long gone but their first hand accounts will live on from generals and admirals to sergeants  russian civilians  concentration camp survivors  all are on record here    i can remember the lord mountbatten interview  killed in the  s    this is truly a gem and i believe the producer of this series was knighted by queen elizabeth for this work   well deserved   seeing these few episodes from the library makes me want to buy the set   this is the only   i have given any review but i have discovered like a fine bottle of wine  it is more appreciated with a little time
