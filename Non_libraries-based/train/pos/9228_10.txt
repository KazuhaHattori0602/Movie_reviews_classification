expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges  flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated   it actually has a feminist storyline  though i don t think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set  it certainly wasn t practiced  women  and the jews and the poor  are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society  throughout the story  sister flavia  florinda bolkan  witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can t sit there any longer and actually does something about it  albeit with disastrous results   the pre credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield  she sees an injured  evil  muslim soldier  one of the few still alive  and tries to assist him  before she can  her hate filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face  great family dynamics  huh  after this  her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice  though scenes do involve violence  rape and nuns  i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation    indeed  many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there  but the acting  camera work  storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level  most  nun  films i ve seen usually have the basic premise of  a good girl somehow winds up in a convent  where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and or make their lives a living hell   flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her  much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong spirited  but slightly loony  she likes to pee outside like me  but it s a lot easier for guys  sister agatha  when a group of muslims attack their abbey  flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns  their attackers actually function as their liberators  of the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey  in fact  it is a christian  not a muslim invader  that impales dear sister agatha    it is agatha s death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her  her father treats her like dirt  her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time  i don t want to give out too much of the rest of the story  but be prepared to be shocked  devastated and saddened at the conclusion  this is a great film  so don t be put off by its  undeserved  reputation as a trash epic  plus  how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong  i am not familiar with mar a casares  other works  but sister agatha is a hell of a character   i have read many great reviews of the synapse  us  release  but i love my german x rated kult dvd copy  it isn t anamorphic  but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse s release   and there are also many great  wise or funny lines of dialogue  many from sister agatha    why is god male  the father  the son  and the holy spirit
 they re all male   flavia   these men are afraid  look at them  sister  afraid their power will be taken away from them   sr  agatha  regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive    woman  where are you going  the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven t done  ha ha ha   sr  agatha  to a group of fleeing christian women    lord bless these moslems  for putting fear into these pompous christians   flavia   does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you  h t your underclothing   sr  agatha  closing message   flavia gaetani  not yet a muslim   no longer a christian   was punished as a runaway nun  the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the   at otranto
