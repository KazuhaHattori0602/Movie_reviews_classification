 for a wickedly funny who ll do it    directed by sidney lumet  ira levin s long running broadway hit doesn t stray too far from its stage origin  the cast is enjoyable and the story s twists are still engrossing  one thing that did not work  for me  was the curtain call ending  surely  it played better on stage   deathtrap  is a fun film to watch again  the performances are dead on   but  in hindsight  the greeting reeve gives caine at the east hampton train station should have been simplified to a smiling  hello  the location isn t really east hampton  but the windmill and pond look similar  and  the much ballyhooed love scene is shockingly tepid  but  the play was so good   even a gifted director couldn t ruin it  and  mr  lumet doesn t disappoint     deathtrap   sidney lumet   michael caine  christopher reeve  dyan cannon  irene worth
