this film was great   the plot was preposterous   the action sequences contrived   but  provided you can lighten up enough to laugh  it was a throughly thrilling romp combining keystone cops and the lone ranger   the baddies were more silly than bad  the good guys weren t too good  the black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes   the inclusion of a baby added a good touch  sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise    i have to disagree about the acting  it was  on the whole  very good  i really wanted to punch judge reinhold   and  after all  isn t that the mark of a really good movie  wanting to punch judge reinhold
