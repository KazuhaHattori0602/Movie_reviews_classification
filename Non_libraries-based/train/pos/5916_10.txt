i had watched this film from ralph bakshi  wizards  hey good lookin  one night ago on   afrovideo org  and i didn t see anything racial  i am not stupid  i do admit the character designs are a bit crude and unaccpectable today  but i think it s a satire and a very very urban retelling of the old uncle remus stories that the black american culture  created right down to the main characters and the blatant nod to  the tar baby  and  the briar patch  these aren t bigoted stories  mind you  but cultural icons created by black americans  and me being a white woman read and love those stories  and i also found it an interesting time capsule view on the black culture in harlem  new york in the  s   well to get to the nitty gritty of this film  this film is a live action animated film  which begins in live action with a fellow named sampson  barry white  and the preacherman  charles gordone  rush to help their friend  randy  philip michael thomas  escape from prison  but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police  while waiting for them  randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy  scatman crothers  as he begins to tell randy the animated story of brother rabbit  a young newcomer to the big city who quickly rises from obscurity to rule over all of harlem  you know  to me rabbit bear and fox are animal versions of randy sampson and the preacherman  an abstract juxtaposition of stylized animation and live action footage  the film is a graphic and condemnatory satire of stereotypes prevalent in the  s   racial  ethnic  and otherwise   so anyway  it is another good bakshi movie  and should we sweep films like this under the rug  pretend they never exist  hmmm i think that would be a shame  i think we should watch these films entacted  and learn about what goes on back then  just how far we come since then
