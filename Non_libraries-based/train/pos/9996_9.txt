i have not read the other comments on the film  but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementary   i watched it for the second time with my children  they absolutely loved it  true  it did not have the adults rolling around the floor  but the sound of the children s enjoyment made it seem so   it is a true mel brooks farce  with plenty of moral content   how sad it is to be loved for our money  not for whom we are  and how fickle are our friends and associates  there are many other films on a similar subject matter  no doubt  many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults  it s hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family  however   hence  for the children  a   from me
