the pervert s guide to cinema       if loving cinema makes me a pervert  so be it   if you are a true  moviefreak  like me then i m sure you can t get enough of films about film making and i don t mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then  i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience  well if that s the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you   in sophie fiennes  sister of ralph   joseph if you were wondering  has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive  and often outrageous  takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing  probing  and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings  socioeconomic  political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging  determined and near frenetic dissertations  to go from explaining how the bates  house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego  superego   id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman   although i had no idea who zizek was   he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma  european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese   with his sibilant tongue and passion  the host comes across as a mad prophet    fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips  backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick  lynch  hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz  the red shoes  and fight club    there s something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film s themes   even if they are freudian jungian to a fault   then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch  seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video  it s the only way to appreciate it
