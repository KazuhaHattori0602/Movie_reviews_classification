 spoilers   this is only the second pay per view i ve given a perfect   the first being the   royal rumble  it was full of exciting matches that weren t memorable  just disposable fun  and that s why i love it   the opening match between razor and dibiase  as well as ludvig borga vs  marty jannetty were the only low points  they were ok matches  but dibiase deserved better in his final pay per view match  these days  a match like this would have run ins and a bigger climax for razor s first major babyface push  and jannetty  fresh off a intercontinental title run  could have had a better match with borga  but i don t think anyone really cared  they just needed a borga push on pay per view television   irs and the kid were great  as were michaels and perfect  i wish perfect could have won  but michaels lies down for no one  notice how right after this  he left the wwf so he wouldn t have to job to razor  bret hart had two great brawls with doink  notice how everyone s best match is against the hit man  and then lawler  their rivalry was a classic  that s why that year s feud of the year was a no brainer  how often do you see two legends win feud of the year this late in their careers   the steiners heavenly bodies match was one of the best of the year  who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever   many say that the undertaker giant gonzalez match was a waste of time  but i loved it  remember  what made the old wwf  as in  pre wwe  great was the mix of athleticism and freak show  is there a soul out there who didn t like akeem   the main event wasn t bad  although nowhere near match of the year status  they put lex luger over well  but made a wise choice in having yokozuna keep the belt  he was the first heel since superstar graham to hold the belt for more than two months  nowadays  heels are champions all the time  but from the beginning of the wwwf through the wwf of the  s  if you blinked  you missed a heel title reign   as an old school wrestling fan  this one and summerslam   are my favorites
