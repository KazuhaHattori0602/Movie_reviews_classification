this is simply the epitome of what a made for tv movie should be  it was a lazy sunday afternoon when my wife and i were in grad school that we stumbled upon this  the cheesy acting  the poorly written script  the good ol  boys  the ridiculous  yet somehow obvious  clich  and banal premise  the riding in pickup trucks with your propped up wife corpse  it has it all   you will meet familiar characters  gold digging hussy  stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own  friends who know better  daddy who knows better but drives son away  and the wife corpse  propped up  in a pick up    wow  and the title  several things in our lives have been  texas tragedies  since watching this beauty  everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal
