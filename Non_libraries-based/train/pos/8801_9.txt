this is the greatest film i saw in   whereas i m used to mainstream movies  it is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these   short films  from the technical info  the chosen directors  i feared it would have an anti american basis  but   it s a kind of   times  personal tribute   the weakest point comes from y  chahine   he does not manage to  swallow his pride  and considers this event as a well merited punishment   it is really the weakest part of the movie  but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece  the weirdest comes from the mexican nearly conceptual art film   i am still not sure what a  gonzalez inarritu meant  the   others are perfect  k  loach  s  penn  s  makhmalbaf    or nearly perfect  c  lelouch  and made me either smile  or cry or even left me stunned  i still don t know if s  imamura s fable is really related or not to the september  th catastrophe  but it is so pretty that its finale place deeply  makes it
