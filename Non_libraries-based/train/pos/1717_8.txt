the story is about ankush  abhay deol    who is professional marriage witness  in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office   and megha  soha ali khan  who ran away from her home at nainital to get married to her love interest dhiraj  shayan munshi  the story starts with megha waiting at the marriage registration office for dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up  so ankush comes in the picture here  who had approached megha with the intention of earning rs    for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her  ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent  ankush falls in love with megha and she too falls in love with him  or kind of love  both agree for the marriage and dhiraj comes back in the picture  unexpected circumstances happen  actually i should say  expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then   actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different  then you will definitely like the movie  the movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of abhay deol and soha ali khan  the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door  the background music of the film also plays a very good role  it is just too good  the way delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling   so let s cut it out and sum it up   story  a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience   music  well  as it was himesh reshammiya creation  so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the qawwali   acting  abhay deol was the most impressive  very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs  soha ali khan  she is a doll  a very cute doll i must say  again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters  apart from these two  shayan munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones  other actors did their job well   stars  i would also give it   stars out of   you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre  i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories  otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive  the movie will definitely won t be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity
