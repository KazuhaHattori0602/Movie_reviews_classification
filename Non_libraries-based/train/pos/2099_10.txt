this is superb   the acting wonderful  sets  clothes  music   but most of all the story itself   i am amazed there aren t more reviews of this movie   certainly one of the best of the  s   it s also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great  random harvest  which has much the same opening crisis     a middle aged  unknown english w w i officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war  suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name  origin  or anywhere he belongs   he proves to be a very wealthy established man   when he  recovers  he will not remember the years before the war     but there the movies  resemblances end   my warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie   particularly the actors ian holm  alan bates  ann margret  what a great and surprising casting choice  glenda jackson  julie christie   this one stays with you forever
