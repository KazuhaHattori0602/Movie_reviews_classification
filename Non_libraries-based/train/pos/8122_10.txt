i never saw this movie until i bought the tape last year  i was enthralled and entertained  it has all the elements of what i love to see in a sci fi story  in a book or on the screen  there s social commentary  speculation  and a good story   there s something eerie  and amusing  watching a   view of the  distant future  of the  s and  s   i think it s a must see  and not only for sci fiers
