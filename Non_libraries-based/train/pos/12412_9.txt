what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise  a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films  so could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated   prison  is the finnish director harlin s american debut  which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like  die hard    cliffhanger  and  deep blue sea  the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison  re opened for the cause of over population in other  more modern state penitentiaries  inside the former execution dungeons  the restless spirit of the electric chair s last victim still dwells around  the now promoted warden eaton sharpe  lane smith  was there already   years ago  when this innocent man was put to death  and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial  it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived  viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past    prison  contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it s the unbearably tense atmosphere that ll stick to you for certain  unlike any other horror picture from that decade   prison  features an amazing sense of realism  by this  i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls  of course  and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed  even though these are genuinely unsettling as well  the film s best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror  the absolute best terror moment  providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age  focuses on a grizzly death struggle involving barbed wire  haunting  the screenplay only suffers one flaw  but that s a common one almost inevitable  i guess  clich s  the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding  we ve got the ugly  fat pervert with his  cute  boy toy  the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and   naturally   the old  n wise black con who serves a lifetime  did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman  don t stare yourself blind on these clich s is my advise  as there are so many other elements to admire  the photography is dark and moist  the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate roles of class b actors are excellent  the fans will recognize tom everett  tom  tiny  lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder  forget about wes craven s god awful attempt  shocker  or the downright pathetic cheese flick  the chair  this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down  especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays  i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves  hobbits and other fairy creatures  this true  s horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd release
