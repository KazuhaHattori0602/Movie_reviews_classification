this film is like marmite  you either love it or you hate it  if you go into this film expecting a proper film with decent production values  a good plot and great characters you ll hate it  if you go into this film expecting a low budget slasher you ll probably hate it   if you go into this film expecting to see one of the most deranged characters ever put to film in the form of harry russo you will love it  john giancaspro is absolutely brilliant in his over the top portrayal of the insane  murderous coke fiend   the special effects are abysmal at best but really  who cares  if you re the kind of person who s prepared to watch a film schizophreniac  the whore mangler you ve undoubtedly seen scores of horror films filled with gore  with the budget this film was made for even if they had tried it probably would ve mediocre at best  i d much rather be able to laugh at something abysmal than be unaffected by the mediocre   to sum it up  you ll probably hate this film but if you re one of the few who decide to see it anyway it ll become the best thing since sliced bread   i hate marmite
