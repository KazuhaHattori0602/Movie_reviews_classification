ealing studios  a television and film production company based in west london  claims to be the oldest film studio in the world  though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the  s  its golden age was most certainly between   and   when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces  many starring the great alec guinness  such well known titles include  whisky galore     passport to pimlico    kind hearts and coronets    the lavender hill mob    the titfield thunderbolt   and  the ladykillers   one of ealing studio s most beloved films   the man in the white suit  was released in   and starred alec guiness as sidney stratton  a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric  an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends   sidney stratton is poor and unappreciated  but he has scientific talent in great abundance  due to his under qualification  the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories  where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company s own money and equipment  after being found out and ejected countless times  sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry  encouraged by his daughter daphne  joan greenwood  textile mill owner alan birnley  cecil parker  takes a keen interest in sidney s exploits and agrees to finance any further work  after numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth shattering explosions  sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation  an almost luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out   if sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero  then he was sorely disappointed  the all powerful bosses of textiles industry  headed by the frail sir john kierlaw  ernest thesiger  unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention  which could completely cripple their businesses  never goes into full scale production  likewise  the humble labourers in the workers  union hear of sidney s creation and also set out to erase it from existence  fearing for their jobs  the inventor  however  is convinced that the ever lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many  and refuses to give in to the demand of others  despite being threatened with violence and offered   in compensation  throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media  only one person offers sidney her complete sympathy and support  birnley s daughter daphne  who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with sidney s plight anyway    the man in the white suit  is a clever and hilarious comedy  made great by a witty script  written by john dighton  roger macdougall and director alexander mackendrick  and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable alec guinness  there are also a few good natured swipes at capitalism  and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations  though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate
