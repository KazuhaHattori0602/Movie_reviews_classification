i loved the story  somewhere  a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film  well maybe there ought to be  i thought everybody seemed really human and believable  what a top notch cast  what great music on the soundtrack  what a nice this  and what a nice that  but most of all  i will say two words to recommend this film   steve carell   he really showed a nice  subtle depth that touched me  he was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first  at the cost of denying his own needs   did he act like a petulant ass  why  yes he did   and you see  that s what was perfect about this film  the actor who played this character made me believe he was feeling something  and not simply acting like he was feeling something  and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling  and what he was feeling was denied   denied happiness   denied fulfillment   denied love   losing your love is painful beyond belief  and many who do so will never feel something like that again   beautiful film   i gave it an eight out of ten
