like the characters in this show  i too was a teen during the  s  the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist  of being a suburban teenager in the  s  the  s fashions  cars  home furnishings  foods  and fads  are all very authentic in this show   the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast  who all mesh together very well on camera  i really like the unique  psychedelic style film sequences  no other show does camera tricks like this  these cutting edge film sequences  really help to convey the campy hipness  that characterized the  s era   overall this is a very funny sitcom  the one thing that bothers me about this show  is it s over reliance on cruel humor  to generate laughs  in this way  i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children  while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right  it s tacky that the creators of that  s show  keep trying to imitate it    i do recommend that  s show  mainly due to it s nostalgia factor  it could be an even better show though  if the writers relied more on witty dialog  rather than bawdy  tasteless jokes and pranks
