 moonstruck  is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller  norman jewison  in the heat of the night  fiddler on the roof  the hurricane  the film is great on many levels  it shows a good slice of italian culture  has a touching romance  and  best of all  is a hilarious comedy   one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors  nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film  and cher  well  cher always looks a little odd   overall  it s a fun film  and easy to recommend     out of
