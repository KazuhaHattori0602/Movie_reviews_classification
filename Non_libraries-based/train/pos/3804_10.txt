my   year old loved it  i loved it  my wife loved it  so   out of   from our family  as for violence level  not really that violent  mostly of the slap stick variety  nobody truly dies  no gore  no blood  no torture  so it certainly is appropriate for children  much more so than many saturday morning cartoons   this movie really takes the idea of cg movies where it should go   first of all beautiful graphics  textures wonderfully done  with true depth  not trying to be realistic  but forming an artistic whole  the moss on the stones  the rust on metal  the reliefs on the wood and the stone  everything adds to the whole   character modeling  unlike many contemporary cg movies  is quirky  not cute  again within an artistic whole  the faces may look less malleable than in some other movies  but the characters are more puppet like than human like  i think that is a good thing  it lends veracity  how strangely it may sound  it is easier to suspend your disbelief   hair  fur  clothing  on par  at least with the likes of pixar  just note in the opening scenes when lian chu is fighting the giant slug  gwizdo is in front of some farmers  and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it   the setting  far beyond the likes of cars  and even wall e  space has been done many times  but the fantasy environs of dragon hunters are only comparable with some scenes in never ending story and lord of the rings  but again it is an artistic whole  and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly  magnificent vistas like the scene in monsters inc  where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility  or wall e where we see the immense trash towers he made  abound in this movie  everything is grand  yet never dwelt upon  it is just the background the whole way  the interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls  the chinese wall  the islands floating in the sky  the broccoli in the sky  that is truly where i believe cg should go  make something which takes your breath away  and do it again and again   the sound is good  the music is varied and not only epic  and thankfully without any vocals  and purely original for the movie   animation is quite good  lending its inspiration to cartoons  especially some good use of stretch and squeeze  sometimes not that realistic  but the  d models are not realistic either   characterization is well done too  lian chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little zo   gwizdo the wily manager of lian chu redeems himself in the end  while zo  isn t really changed at all  but who wants that cute child to change anyway  i at least loved lian chu more than any other recent character since sulley in monsters inc   the internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures  just as it should in a proper fantasy story   the story is mostly reminiscent of the never ending story  especially how the world brakes apart  the monsters are pretty standard fare  except the flocking one  it lacks the emotional impact of wall e  which is the really strong point of that movie  but it is a much more fun ride  and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one  and has action from the first scene  this movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time   the whole movie has  as i ve mentioned a whole vision  which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout   it seems  that the setting is ready for more adventures  and i for one would hope so   one side note  the french actor doing lian chu sounded a bit like jean reno at first  but i m happy it wasn t him  though he is one of my favorites  nice to hear a new  to me  voice   i give it a max rating  a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some  i have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote  approach this movie as an adventure  and as a european movie  not opposed to hollywood  but different
