  charlie kauffman has made weird metaphysical angst popular  but this canadian gem makes it hilarious    like most weird films the less said about plot the better but let s set the scene  two friends anthony and dave have been together since childhood  they can t cope with the world and eventually this means they no longer have to  but that is where even more problems begin   i loved this film  it made me smile long after the final credits and that is a rare experience with so many mass produced pieces of  nothing  out there   don t miss this
