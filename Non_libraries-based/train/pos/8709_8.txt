i recently  may   discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd  although i ve seen a great deal of high quality movies since then  late  s  i was   in   this three episode  low budget thing still stands strong   what s fun is that i now watched it with my   year old daughter  and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then  the creepy music  she had to hold my hand  even though she s been raised with watching lotr and resident evil  the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is  and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting   this is the one and only good science fiction movie  or series  ever made in norway  and it s still worth watching
