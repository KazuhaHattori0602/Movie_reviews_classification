simon pegg plays the part of sidney young  a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous  he is making a career out of lampooning celebrities  although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself  the movie is based on the very bizarre career of toby young  who also ran a small magazine in britain called the modern review  which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable  until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co editor  and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for vanity fair  which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie    he is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication  called sharp s magazine in the movie  and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day  he meets the chief editor  clayton harding  played by jeff bridges  who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof off like young to keep his job at the magazine  he offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of young  but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of young s off the wall antics and inappropriate behavior    much of the comedy in the movie is derived from young s misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous  but sidney s reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and  it would seem  he believes in that age old saying    if you can t beat  em  join  em
and then beat  em   complicating matters are two very different women  there is a charming  regular girl at the magazine named alison olsen  kirsten dunst  who at first is appalled by sidney s obvious arrogance and womanizing ways  and a stunning model named sophie  megan fox  who represents the celebrity culture  needless to say  sidney s endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for sophie  the one with the look of a star   sophie is stunningly beautiful  it s true  but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head  alison is a regular girl  not very interesting or attractive  but dunst s performance makes her a real person  a relationship with her would have all the reality of a britney spears marriage  and yet the movie retains some level of believability because  despite how obvious this is  we also feel sidney s pain in not pursuing her  i felt it  anyway   how to lose friends and alienate people has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest  satisfactory performances  and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act  it has a variety of well developed and interesting characters  danny huston  for example  gives us a great performance as alison s other love interest  who pays homage to the big lebowski  also starring bridges  with his ever present white russian  one of my personal favorite drinks  buying absolute and kahlua here in china costs the equivalent of about   but my kitchen is never without them    i am looking forward to the day when simon pegg will branch out a little bit  because i love his films but i am completely unsure about his range  he played a serious character in hot fuzz  but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him  and ultimately went back to being himself again  which he has pretty much been in shaun of the dead  run  fat boy  run  and now how to lose friends  he s a rising star  it will be interesting to see what else he can do
