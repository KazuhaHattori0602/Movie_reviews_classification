probably jackie chan s best film in the  s  and the one that put him on the map  the scale of this self directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes  during which a squatters  village and shopping mall are demolished  there are  clearly  differences between the original chinese and dubbed english versions  with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter  the latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their chinese originals  in fact  the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trial at the time  trials in colonial hong kong were conducted in english  while the original has this scene in cantonese   nonetheless  chan s fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible  so non cantonese audiences don t miss much  it s not  after all  the dialogue that makes a chan flick  but the action and the painful out takes  the story is easy to follow  chan plays an incorruptible hong kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather  cho yeun  and assigned to protect a star witness  brigitte lin  the action is superb from beginning to end  and there s not much time to breathe in between  it ll never get you thinking  but what an entertaining  and well strung together  film  arguably  this is one of the best martial arts films out there
