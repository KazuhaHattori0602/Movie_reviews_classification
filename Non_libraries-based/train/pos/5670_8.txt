esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off  to a good start  this film is a well acted entertaining suspense  with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more  in the future   innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater  esther  looks great and if she wanted to  probably could have gone on to  do more and better films but according to her autobiography    pretty much gave up working for marriage  either way she is so  likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role  outside of the  swimming musical  universal was fabulous for  making films with former mgm stars after that studio began  dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill  stars  like lana turner  june allyson and others got to make quality first  rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at  the box office  i wish esther had made more but since she didnt  it  makes this one all the more special
