 shock corridor   was my first film from samuel fuller  and there i was impressed with the director s astute blending of b movie and big budget aesthetics  even if the story itself was pure schlock   pickup on south street   was released a decade earlier in fuller s career  obviously produced on a larger budget from a big name studio  twentieth century fox  nevertheless  the visuals are still notable in that there s a somewhat raw  naturalistic element to the photography  not unlike dassin s  the night and the city   and kazan s  panic in the streets    the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald  in some scenes  fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors  faces that they re out of focus  bluntly registering the intimate thoughts  emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features  the eye  though  unexpectedly  prone to melodrama  and with just a hint of anti communist propaganda   pickup on south street  is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting   the underground of new york city   when just out of prison pickpocket skip mccoy  richard widmark  snags the purse of a woman on the subway  jean peters  he pockets more than he d originally bargained for  the woman  candy  and her cowardly ex boyfriend joey  richard kiley  had been smuggling top secret information to the communists  and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro film  will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities  or sell it to the highest bidder  if  pickup on south street  has a flaw  it s that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti communist agenda  reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii  dwight taylor  who supplied the story  also notably wrote  the thin man goes home   the only propagandistic movie of the series  for no apparent reason  every identifiable character   even the smugly self serving skip mccoy   eventually becomes a self sacrificing patriot  the transformation predictable from the outset  in traditional film noir  the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance  the rational punishment for his sins  but apparently not when they ve served their country  patriotism wipes the slate clean   richard widmark  an actor who i m really beginning to like  plays the haughty pickpocket with composure  though always with that hint of ill ease that suggests he s biting off more than he can chew  the opening scene on the train is the film s finest  as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim s hand bag  recalling bresson s  pickpocket   thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street woman who ll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it  though  of course  she draws the line at commies  jean peters is well cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side  playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour  fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow legged strut of a prostitute  nevertheless  peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film s attempts at realism  fascinatingly  upon its release   pickup on south street  was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi  and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite  go figure
