i have to say that higher learning is one of the top   movies i have ever watched  it has a brilliant cast  and an equally brilliant director  singleton shows how life in university can be  there are   main story lines  the skinheads  the african americans  and the homosexuals  i was intrigued by all of the stories  but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen  battling her feelings towards another girl  the end was great  after seeing the movie   times plus  i still cry  i would have given this movie an   but i have to settlefor
