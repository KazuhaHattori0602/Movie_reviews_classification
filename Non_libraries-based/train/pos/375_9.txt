this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen  i was about   years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it  the acting and plot are amazing  it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics  i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama
