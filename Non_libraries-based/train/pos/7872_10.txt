the first review i saw of page   said  what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say  should he say something so decisive   the most beautiful thing about page   is it doesn t take sides  no propaganda whatsoever  this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue i don t know what do i call as an  issue  here  and yet like any mediocre movie doesn t come up with an solution  i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started   the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic  i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead  so watch page   if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times
