time and time again  it seems that the comedic actors of hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers  first it was robin williams  one hour photo   then it was jim carrey  eternal sunshine
   being one example  then will ferrell  stranger than fiction   and now adam sandler  yes  that s absolutely right  the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless  goofball comedies  i m not complaining  i ve always been a fan  has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud  of course  some readers may be wondering whatever happened to  punch drunk love   but i can only assure you that it s a film i m currently taking measures to see as soon as possible  since i ve heard it s terrific  my first film from director mike binder   reign over me  is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship  though it does occasionally stray into all too familiar territory  the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving  with both sandler and don cheadle giving memorable performances   alan johnson  cheadle  is a successful dentist with a good family  though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife  jada pinkett smith  and so his marriage is a little shaky  charlie fineman  adam sandler  is alan s ex college roommate  a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of september     and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief  a disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes  often likened in appearance to bob dylan  charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry  and spends his time in solitude  listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world  driving around manhattan in his motorised scooter  immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife s final wishes  when alan and charlie meet for the first time in years  the latter doesn t even recognise an old friend  having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life crippling experience  indeed  at first he doesn t even acknowledge the existence of his family  and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling   initially  it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the september   attacks as a storytelling device  afterall  wouldn t it be just as devastating if charlie s family had died in an ordinary  everyday car accident  however  if you consider that the director s intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy  then  reign over me  does a very good job  it s easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks  this is the first  orientated film i ve seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren t even involved  whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved  adam sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role  one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task  snapping instantly between cheerfulness  anger and depression  charlie fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise  a hollow soul who  thanks to the companionship of an old friend  can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark  bleak tunnel
