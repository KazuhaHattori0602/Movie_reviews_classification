some saying about  the play is the most important thing  or something like that  is attributed to that old bard of avon  himself  william shakewspeare  if it wasn t old will  it may well have been our own  super veteran film director  mr  raoul walsh  there are a large number of his films that would support this hypothesis  none are more appropriate than gentleman jim warner brothers     the film also racks up another award  being named as errol flynn s favourite of his own starring vehicles  it clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the darkened theatre  or viewing it on their home tv or dvd  to conclude same   to be sure  the story is a semi serious biopic  which takes a portion of factual material and blends it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying  albeit somewhat fictionalized what biopic isn t occurrences   the casting is excellent  as it makes good use of the natural athleticism of our lead  mr  errol flynn  though not a swashbuckler  a western or a war picture  this gentleman jim is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged australian   errol was a member of the australian olympic boxing team in either   or   his training and skills in the  sweet science are clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the  big fight  for the world s heavyweight boxing championship with the great john l sullivan himself played in expert fashion by ward bond  the cast reads like a duty roster of warner brothers  resident supporting players  it features alan hale as jim corbet s father  a livery wagon operator  his two brothers are harry and george  pat flaherty and james flavin  the two  blue collar  men of the family  their occupations being stated as being  longshormen   the great jack carson does his usual masterful serio comic performance in support as jim corbett s friend and fellow bank teller  the rest of those we can both recognize and remember are john loder  william frawley madeleine lebeau  minor watson  rhys williams arthur shields dorothy vaughn to name but a few   director walsh also used a number of pro wrestlers in roles of various boxers  hence we have ed  strangler  lewis and an unknown grappler  are featured as the   waterfront pugs in the opening scenes  others were sammy stein  mike mazurki ever hear of him and  wee willie  davis  these guys had a powerful yet unpolished look about them that the old pier   brawlers would have possessed   we haven t forgotten leading lady  alexis smith  she is powerful in her characterization of an  independent  woman  yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes  she displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl  victoria lodge   with all these ingredients at hand  the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the  just right  blend  well  director walsh does so with a reckless abandon  because he is looking for  above all  a great film  his treatment shows all of the skills he had honed to a fine tuning starting with his days as a player with d w  griffith  mr  walsh seems to have a special fondness for that period  the  s  mr  walsh s direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip  breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch line   the corbetts are at it again  hence  he is able to maintain a light  even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious   furthermore  in an almost unnoticed element  brother walsh gives us an authentic look of a san francisco of the  s  and as a further example of his fondness for that period  he creates wide  dynamic images of the historic prize fights  there is a vibrant  joyful mood conveyed in those boxing scenes  as a crowning glory to this great  perhaps underrated film  director walsh gave the image a look as if it were an illustration from the police gazette  which covered such events in those  old days   but there s just one thing to remember before viewing  if it is for the first time  or if your seeing it once more    the corbets are at it again     in my humble opinion as a historian of both film and pro wrestling  it looks like tor johnson  who years later was a favourite of director ed wood s     a  livery  is a somewhat archaic term for a vehicle for hire for local city transportation     it s true  mr  raoul walsh was a griffith veteran player  he was the actor to portray john wilkes booth in the birth of a nation     being born in   raoul walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the  s and of the sullivan corbett championship bout and what it meant to the sporting life in the america of those days
