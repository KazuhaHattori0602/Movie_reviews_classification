a super comedy series from the  s  two series were made in total  that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling  when you are up against established comedies like  minder  even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed   luckily  i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly  i mentioned it to friends and family at the time  but everyone seemed to have been watching something else  very  very frustrating   anyway  i loved both series and never forgot it   then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra fan was trying to get both series released  on his own   well  both series are now available on dvd
