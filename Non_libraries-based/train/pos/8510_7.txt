this was the eighth and final columbia whistler film and the only one without richard dix who had retired from movies and was to die the following year  it s still a competent thriller  the machine carried on without him perfectly  but   something was missing  dix  the stories in the whistler series were always interesting  sometimes brilliant  the screenplays often noir always atmospheric  but it wasn t only the whistler himself that hung it all together on screen  dix did too   young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married before she apparently goes mad  is the potential groom put off  even when the private dick he s hired to find her suddenly slugs him and lams  or is love blind  who s twisting who is the question  michael duane in his penultimate film is ok if a bit of a wimp  lovely lenore aubert s finest moments came next film in abbott   costello meet frankenstein  and richard lane was wonderful as ever on loan from boston blackie  also the only outing where the whistler himself must have got wet from slouching about in the rain  unless he got sprayed with sea foam in voice   a lot happened in this last hour  well worth watching over and over again as usual to fans of the genre like me  the whistler radio series begun in   carried on until   clocking up nearly   half hour shows  nearly all of which are available on mp  and based upon what i ve heard so far nearly all of which are well worth listening to as well
