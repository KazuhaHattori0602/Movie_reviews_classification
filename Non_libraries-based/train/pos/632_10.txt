ok here is how i do this  i grade movies on   components  each component will inherently start with   points  it can then lose or gain   points for a possible   or    mood  action  romance  comedy  drama  suspense   i give this component   points  it had a perfect balance of all five aspects  the action was fun and exiting  the romance was not overdone  but still very emotional and moving  i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama  and riveting suspense   plot   i give this component   points  i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told  i found my self  sitting in the theatre  returned to my childhood  and in that instant i again believed in unicorns  wicked witches  and falling stars that make dreams come true   cinema photography   i give this component   points  while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles  i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera   fx   i give this component   points  i love that they used c g i  sparingly  the epic scenes were believable  the magical powers were frighteningly realistic  all in all less is more  and this had it all  cast   i give this component   points  no names and seasoned actors alike  the cast was amazing  michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked  charlie cox made tristan come to life  claire danes gave emotion to the stars  and i will never look and robert de niro the same again   acting   i give this component   points  even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection  once again  i will never look and robert de niro the same again   character development   i give this component   points  this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice   dialogue   i give this component   points  the dialogue was smart  witty  fun
 even the mush had good dialogue   score   i give this component   points  i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie  i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable   ending   i give this component   points  almost perfect ending  i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced  while others could have been more subdued  but no threads were left untied   total    buy the dvd  hel yes  see it in the theatre  most definitely  bottom line  excellent movie for everyone  epic  i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre  i know i ll be going back for seconds
