the title says it all   i m not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie   obviously this movie didn t have a multi million dollar budget  but the plot was very well done  the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great  it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie  i voted   out of   as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both  but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd   i ll definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films    dylan o leary  cast and crew  i thank you
