 deliverance  is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful  s decade from whence so many other exploitation films came   a group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives  it s awesome   we are treated to anal rape  vicious beatings  bow and arrow killings  shootings  broken bones  etc  a lot like  s  texas chainsaw massacre  to say that  deliverance  is believable would be immature  this would never and could never happen  even in the dark ages of     deliverance  is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action  it is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early  s and it  arguably  sits on top of that pile with it s great acting  superb cinematography and excellent writing     out of   kids
