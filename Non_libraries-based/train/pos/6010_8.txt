 zabriskie point    this was especially interesting to me on a personal level  since it takes place under identical circumstances  with identical peers  in my own life   the counter culture movement of the late  s early  s  on and off campus  we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories  who are slowly woven together  one is a young man in los angeles  tired of all the endless  pseudo revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus  and  the other  a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father   employer  and take on an  establishment  job  the film is full of our italian director s  michelangelo antonioni  visual notations of america  and  the confused  psychedelicrazies of that era s self righteous   we know it all  we ll change everything for the better  youth  just who is the  revolutionary  what does that really mean  do you dress like one and march around chanting  do you  fly in under the radar  but give advance notice of your arrival  do you keep your plans to yourself  and go about the business of change  with no need for group approval   zabriskie point  is definitely a  period piece    full of slang  uniforms  somewhat surreal film moments  after all  this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing  blow up  of   and the era s artifacts  but it is more  it presents options for cultural revolution  and going by antonioni  who does seem to be supportive of it  the youth are too self involved to see what is needed for radical success  because of this  it becomes a powerful  frightening film that applies to anyone  any time  any place
