i work with children from       years old and they all love the doodlebops  the doodlebops are energetic  vibrant and appealing  once they start singing   we re the doodlebops we re the doodlebops we re the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we re laughing and we re singing all day  it is almost impossible not to join them in song  the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun  each show is an adventure  the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to  the doodlebops is an refreshing  high action alternative to regular children s television programs
