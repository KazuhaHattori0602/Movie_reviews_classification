my brother and i have pokemon  ever on dvd  we watched it like a couple of times and it was the best  too bad it a new pokemon didn t talk this time  i ll get used to it   the iron masked marauder was pretty mean when he captured celebi with his dark ball  good thing ash and sam managed to snap him out of his control   there was only one song in the ending credits called cele b r a t e performed by russell velazquez   pokemon  ever became a success since the three previous films and people will always love that film
