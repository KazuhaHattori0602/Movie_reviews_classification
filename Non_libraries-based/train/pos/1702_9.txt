if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating  but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone   just people with a sense of humor   for those people the movie is great  it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone  most of witch where b rated themselves  along the lines of spaceballs and airplane   you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes  but it is well worth it
