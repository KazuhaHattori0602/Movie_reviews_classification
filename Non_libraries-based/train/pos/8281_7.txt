   but i can t help saying it was not pulled off quite right   this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax  in any case  it s too bad  those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world   but for those of you who don t write or make films  you should know that crafting a story arc with the proper timing is a huge pain in the butt  and i am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal   wendigo feels to me like a masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished  but hay  i d take a blunted masterpiece any day over an over produced piece of dog poo over compensated with too many digital effects  like most horror movies these days   one other comment  some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether i should be scared or laughing  i don t know how to explain it  but there was a distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent  monster  forms  although this may sound like a terrible criticism for a horror movie i don t know  it still worked for me in some crooked way  i will never look at deer antlers in the same way again
