i love this movie  but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid   the fateful game took place in   that means that the protagonists graduated in   but almost all of the music played at the dances etc  is from the  s and very early  s   having just attended my  th high school reunion  i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents  music   i understand the difficulty of finding relevant  s music   we all know what a desolate time it was musically  but it wasn t completely bereft  and the producers of the film should have taken more care  i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film   this was a bad director and or producer decision
