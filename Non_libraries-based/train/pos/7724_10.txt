sure star wars  a movie i have seen at least fifty times  beats all the others in special effects  but this film has every thing else   it has horror non graphical  romance  robots  witty repartee  intelligence   surprisingly good  special effects  and drama   i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print  and i was amazed at how well it held up today  i thought the old  s style electronics would look hokey  but they somehow looked futuristic and moderne   ann francis in here  mostly  short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me   the krell monster appearing in the ray beams still scares the bejebees out of me   of course we all know that the  great bird of the galaxy  probably modeled much of  star trek  from this movie   no one has yet to beat robby  the robot  in terms of personality   sorry  r d  and c po   this movie  overall  is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to   honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on pins and needles
