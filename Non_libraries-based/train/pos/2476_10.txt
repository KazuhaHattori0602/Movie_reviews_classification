this was the second of two filmed  hamlets  in the nineties  the first being franco zeffirelli s  starring mel gibson  from   zeffirelli s version  like laurence olivier s from   was based upon an abridged version of the play  with much of shakespeare s original text being cut   i have never seen tony richardson s   version  but as that ran to less than two hours  shorter even than zeffirelli s  i presume that was also abridged  kenneth branagh was attempting something much more ambitious  a film based on the complete text of the play  with a running time of around four hours   with his  henry v  branagh claimed olivier s crown as the cinema s leading shakespearean  confirming his claim with his brilliant  much ado about nothing  a rare example of a great film based on a shakespeare comedy   hamlet  was his third shakespeare film as director  he also acted as iago in oliver parker s    othello  and  as one might expect  it is very different to  much ado
  the earlier film  shot in a villa in the hills of tuscany and the beautiful surrounding countryside  is a joyous  summertime film about everything that makes life worth living    hamlet  by contrast is set in the depths of winter   the flowers in the description of ophelia s death suggest that shakespeare himself thought of the action happening in summer  the look of the film is particularly striking  both sumptuous and chilly  it was filmed at blenheim palace  possibly england s most grandiose stately home  but also a rather forbidding one  the snowy exterior scenes are cold and wintry  the interior ones formal and elaborate  the action is updated to the mid nineteenth century  the female characters wear the elaborate fashions of that era  while the principal male ones mostly wear splendid military uniforms   there is a contrast here with zeffirelli s film  where both the interiors and the costumes were deliberately subdued in tone  the play is dominated by images of corruption and decay  branagh s intention may have been to contrast a splendid surface with the underlying  something rotten in the state of denmark   the film is notable for the large number of big name actors  some of them in very minor roles   blink  and you might miss john gieldgud or judi dench  apparently  an all star cast was required by the production company  who were nervous about a four hour film  some of the imported hollywood stars  such as robin williams  osric  did not really come off  but others  like charlton heston s player king or billy crystal s first gravedigger  played their parts very well  yorick  normally only seen as a skull  is here seen in flashback  played by the british comedian ken dodd  brian blessed  who often plays jovial characters  is cast against type as the ghost  and makes the scenes in which he appears genuinely frightening   of the major characters  perhaps the weakest was kate winslet s ophelia  branagh s leading lady in his first two shakespeare films was his then wife emma thompson  but their marriage ended in divorce in   i did  however  find myself wishing that thompson had been cast in the role  although winslet came into her own in the ophelia s mad scenes  she seemed weak in the earlier ones where her character is still sane   i preferred helena bonham carter in zeffirelli s version  richard briers plays polonius with a greater dignity than he is often given  a wise and experienced counsellor rather than a prating old fool  julie christie also brings dignity to the role of gertrude  there is no attempt here  as there was with gibson and glenn close in the zeffirelli version  to suggest an incestuous attachment between her and hamlet   an interpretation which owes more to freud than it does to shakespeare  the age difference between christie and branagh is great enough for them to be credible as mother and son  which was certainly not the case with close and gibson   olivier s gertrude  eileen herlie  was  bizarrely  thirteen years younger than him   branagh stated that his intention in restoring those scenes which are often cut in cinematic versions was to  reinforce the idea that the play is about a national as well as domestic tragedy  much stress is placed upon the war with norway and the norwegian prince fortinbras  a subplot ignored altogether by zeffirelli  this emphasis on national tragedy is perhaps best shown in the character of claudius  sometimes played as a one dimensional villain  there is something about derek jacobi s performance which suggests that claudius could have been a good man under different circumstances  but that he allowed himself to be led astray by ambition and lust  he could have been a good and loyal servant to his brother  but chose to rule as a bad king  although he is tormented by guilt  he can see no way to make amends for the evil he has done   branagh  a wonderfully fluent speaker of shakespeare s verse  is superb in the main role  like gibson  he has little time for the old concept of hamlet as indecisive  passive and melancholy  his is an active  physical  energetic hamlet  something best shown in his fatal duel with laertes  his guiding principle is not world weary despair  but an active disgust with evil and corruption   it was a gamble for branagh to make a four hour epic  and the film did not do well at the box office  it was  however  praised by many critics  james berardinelli being particularly enthusiastic  my own opinion is that  whatever the financial returns may have been  branagh s gamble paid off in artistic terms  by concentrating on the full text  he was able to bring out the full meaning and full emotional power of shakespeare s most complex play  when i reviewed his  much ado
  i said it was the greatest ever film of a shakespeare comedy  his  hamlet  may just be the greatest ever film of a shakespeare tragedy
