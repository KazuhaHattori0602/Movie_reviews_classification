huge ramones fan  i do like the ramones  and i suppose if you hate them  then  besides being a avid bush supporter  you might not like this classic   it s immensely better than the sappy john hughes teen films and the like that littered the  s  infinitely better than the american pie s that plague us now   there are some other great high school films  switchblade sisters  fast times  class of   three o clock high  and the cheesy yet gripping doesn t seem possible  river s edge  but rnrhs will always be my favorite because it s the funniest and most fun  plus you can get up and dance with it   i love you  riff randell
