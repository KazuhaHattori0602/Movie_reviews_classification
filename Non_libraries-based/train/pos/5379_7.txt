there s a lot going on in the college girl murders  a mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas  before he can reap the rewards of his discovery  the scientist is killed by a hooded  whip welding monk  after a co ed is killed in a church by the gas  scotland yard is called in to investigate  but the killing continues  who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college    what works      the killer  what s not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red kkk looking outfit  complete with red gloves  the white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown  although the idea of a killer in a flaming red  pointy head outfit sneaking around a girl s school is fairly far fetched  it s one of the more sinister looking costumes i ve seen     groovy  s music  i really would like to track down the title music to the college girl murders  it s got a jazzy  hip   s feel to it that i just loved     bizarre touches  beyond the killer s red gown and hood  the movie features a sliding fireplace  a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead  poison spraying bibles  a strategically placed mannequin  mini skirts  go go boots  and mile high hair  i would describe it as a cross between the  s batman tv show and an italian giallo  the college girl murders is a real treat for the eye     the end  let s just say that there are more twists than a mountain road  just when you think the killer has been uncovered  here comes a twist
