i was about thirteen when this movie came out on television  it is far superior in action than most movies since  martin sheen is excellent  and though nick nolte has a small part  he too provides excellent support  vic morrow as the villain is superb   when sheen  tests the water  in his   ford  cool  along the mountainous highway it is spectacular   the ending is grand   i m disappointed in the low vote this received  i figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days   good taste eludes the masses
