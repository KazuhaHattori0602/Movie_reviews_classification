have just finished watching this film  which upset me greatly  have also been to south africa twice  around the time this film is set   it is certainly hard hitting  and the opening scenes tend to  set the scene  the slow but steady increase of pace hardly allows a break  and there are certainly few light moments   will never be able to view nigel hawthorne the same again  he came across as a very twisted individual  and i found myself disliking him more each time he appeared   totally agree with steve thomp s articulate and well thought out comments
