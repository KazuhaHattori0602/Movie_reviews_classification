i saw  fever pitch  sort of by accident  it was playing on the airplane going over to europe  it actually wasn t half bad  ben  jimmy fallon  is the world s   red sox fan  but his relationship with lindsay meeks  drew barrymore  may strain that  the movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples  relationships  it s especially eye opening now that the red sox have ended their  odd year losing streak  i guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just don t tend to notice them  not too bad   another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is  s  frequency  check them both out
