although in my opinion this is one of the lesser musicals of stars frank sinatra  gene kelly  kathryn grayson and director george sidney  a lesser musical featuring anyone from that line up is nothing to sneeze at  and in conjunction  the line up makes anchors aweigh a pretty good film despite its flaws   sinatra and kelly are clarence doolittle and joseph brady  respectively  two navy men  as the film begins  they re just pulling in to the los angeles area for some much needed leave  brady plans on visiting a girlfriend named lola  doolittle is still a bit wet behind the ears  appropriately enough  and seeks advice on women from brady in private  publicly  scriptwriter isobel lennart and sidney have all of the navy men comically exaggerating their finesse with women to each other  brady promises to help get doolittle hooked up  but primarily because doolittle won t leave him alone otherwise  a kink is put into their plans when local police basically force them to assist with a young boy who is obsessed with the navy  he won t give the police any information about who he is or where he lives  brady helps and he and doolittle end up taking the boy back home  when the boy s guardian  susan abbott  grayson  finally shows up  doolittle goes gaga for her  brady tries to convince him to forget about her  brady just wants to get back to lola  but they keep getting coaxed back to abbott s home  and eventually something of a love triangle forms  things become more complicated when brady lies about doolittle knowing a famous musician  jose iturbi  who is in residence at a film studio  and claims that doolittle has set up an audition for abbott  who is a singer and actress  in front of iturbi   because of the story  the music is a strange combination of militaristic music because of the navy premise  obviously  broadway pop what the stars tend to sing in more informal settings  opera what abbott s character excels at  liberace like popular classical what iturbi did  and mexican music because abbott frequents a mexican restaurant in a mexican section of l a  the combination doesn t work as well as it could  plenty of the songs are good  and everyone involved is certainly talented as a singer or musician  but the genre hopping tends to lose coherence  worse  there are a couple showcases for iturbi  who was apparently a big star at the time  that effectively bring the plot to a halt and that seem more than a bit hokey at this point in time  i just watched another film that happened to have outstanding music  robert altman s kansas city   but that misguidedly stopped the plot to periodically turn into a concert film  anchors aweigh takes a similar tactic  yes  this is a musical  but there s a difference between songs that propel and are integral to the plot and concert showcases that seem like contractual obligation material   there are also some plot problems  it s not very well established why brady is so against doolittle s pursuit of abbott  we can guess that brady thinks doolittle shouldn t become involved with someone who has to take care of a kid  and who seems relatively  proper  and traditional  but on the other hand  brady can tell that doolittle doesn t have the same womanizing disposition that brady admits of himself  abbott seems like a good fit for doolittle  and furthermore  lennart works hard to establish that brady just wants to get doolittle out of his hair and get on with meeting lola it seems that brady s character should be quickly pawning doolittle off on any candidate  whether she s a good fit or not  this might seem like a minor detail  but it s actually the hinge for about a third to half of the plot  the story also seems a bit drawn out  length is a problem  anchors aweigh  clocking in at roughly two hours and twenty minutes  should have been cut down by at least a half hour   the above surely sounds like i m complaining about the film too much to justify an   i just wanted to stress what i see as flaws  because the conventional wisdom on anchors aweigh is much closer to the idea that it has no flaws   sinatra  kelly and grayson are certainly charismatic  separately and together  they turn in good  interesting performances  sinatra looks and acts much younger than his actual age of       while shooting  he plays an unusually na ve  virginal character completely different than most of the roles he would take later  and different than his public image as a crooner  for kelly  this was his breakthrough film  and rightfully so  his choreography is varied and impressive  as is his acting  grayson is charming  her performance is sophisticatedly understated  and she s simply gorgeous  all of this helps override the flaws with the script and the drawn out pacing   and there s even a very interesting element that probably only arises because sidney was allowed to sprawl over a large variety of moods the infamous kelly dance with jerry the mouse  of  tom and jerry  fame  in an extended fantasy sequence  this is one of the earliest examples of combining live action and animation  and it is extremely well done and enjoyable as long as you re a fan of fantasy  the fantasy sequences tend to be the best of the film  matched in excellence to the dance with jerry the mouse is a long song and dance number featuring kelly and grayson  where brady is imagining abbott in a scene from a period film while he woos her  having to resort to acrobatic stunts to reach her physically as she stands on a high balcony   as uneven and flawed as the film is  it is largely successful and entertaining to watch  fans of classic musicals certainly shouldn t miss anchors aweigh  and neither should sinatra fans  who ll get quite a kick out of his character
