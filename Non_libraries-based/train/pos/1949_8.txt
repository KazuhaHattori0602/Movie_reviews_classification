the past few months i have collected voyager seasons   to   on dvd  i only had   to   on video before that  because kes is my favourite character  and have just reached the end  i saw them when they were originally shown on tv here in the uk but had forgotten most of it  am i satisfied with the ending  i think i am  naturally as i fan i would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that s left to our imagination  in many ways  endgame  is similar to next gen s  all good things
  the involvement of the crew in the future  but mainly the captain  a new romance starting in the finale  troi and worf in next gen and seven of nine and chakotay here  which results in death in the future  i truly loved  endgame  fair to all characters  neelix appears although he left the ship two episodes earlier  b elanna gives birth to her daughter with loving husband tom  tuvok is ill but returning home means he can be cured  harry has always been the most anxious and determined but admits the journey is important  the doctor  in the future  is well respected by all and finally chooses the name joe  but of course the captain has the largest role  meeting her future self who wants to get the crew home earlier to prevent casualties  the borg are involved  as they have played a massive part in this period of voyager  alice krige plays the borg queen again fantastically  just her voice and acting method are magnificent  i feel sorry for susanna thompson though  the tv borg queen replaced by the movie borg queen  maybe she wasn t available though  the special effects are fantastic  the borg sub space hub and the borg queen falling apart  it s very tense  especially when they come out of the borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they d be after they d said they d have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant  and what a wonderful idea to get inside a borg sphere for protection  on the dvd special features they say it was like the trojan horse  voyager could have continued  if it was more popular they would have stuck with their original idea of the crew realising the ship is their home  like in harry s speech and what tom said because his wife and child are there  and then they could have got home in a film   overall  voyager was a bit hit and miss  the sixth season seemed to be one good one followed by one less than good one  the two episodes set in the holographic irish village are horrible  my perception of seven of nine was that she took over  it all revolved around her  which wasn t true  when she first appeared  season   was focused on her for too many of the episodes but it evened out after that  and her character is ingenious at times    years as a borg drone gradually rediscovering her humanity  i like her  especially in  someone to watch over me   imperfection  and  human error  when naomi wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side  that was lovely  chakotay became my least favourite character  gone was the chemistry with janeway  will they won t they  and you d never think he was first officer  he s completely pushed aside most of the time  i loved seeing tom and b elanna s relationship blossom against the odds  i always liked neelix a lot  tuvok was good at times  especially when he lost his logic  gained emotion and was friends with neelix  harry was annoying at times but a okay character at other times  the doctor is probably my favourite  seeing how far he comes and comedy situations he creates  tinker  tenor  doctor  spy  is fantastic  janeway is my favourite captain of any series and you can tell kate mulgrew is really enjoying it    i wish there was more  i love voyager
