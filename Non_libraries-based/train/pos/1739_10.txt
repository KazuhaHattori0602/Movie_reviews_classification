from the view of a nascar maniac like i am  the movie is interesting  you can see many race cars from   even tough  the racing scenes are not that much realistic  but i have to admit  that i haven t seen any race before   because before that time  they didn t show any nascar races in germany   from the view of a burt reynolds fan like i am  the movie basically is what we are used to see from reynolds in the  s  burt behind the wheel of a fast car  like in his bandit movies   if you love nascar and burt reynolds  this movie is a must see  if you only love one of this   things  i also recommend to watch it  if you like neither nascar nor burt reynolds  you still should give it a chance  but remember  this movie was far away from winning an oscar academy award   it is the typical humor of the  s  if you like movies like the cannonball movies  and police academy  you will also like that one
