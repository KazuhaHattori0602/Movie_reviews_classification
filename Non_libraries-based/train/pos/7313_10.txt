some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan  then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films  often imitated  never duplicated  this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made  if not the scariest   i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series  don t ask me why  i honestly saw the other   movies before seeing this one  that s just how it worked out  but i would have to say this one blows all the others away  it is genuinely frightening  and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine  my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy  and leans his head to one side  it is one of the eeriest images in movie history   later slashers  such as the friday the  th films  were more fun and less intense than this movie  i do like the f  series better than the halloween series  but this movie alone is better than all the f  movies  michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic  you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people  i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights   what s great about this movie is that it doesn t rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience  it is just pure terror  it s too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one  because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come
