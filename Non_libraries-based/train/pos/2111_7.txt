 the shop around the corner   is a pleasant romantic comedy  not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days  but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation  by   director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm  and his famed  lubitsch touch  had become a sparkling commercial trademark  this film was planned for a   release  but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming  rather than substituting either of his main stars  lubitsch decided to postpone production  in the meantime directing greta garbo in  ninotchka   when it was finally completed   the shop around the corner  appears to have been met with relative indifference  receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role  time  nevertheless  has betrayed the film s massive and enduring influence  with high profile remakes including  in the good old summertime   and  you ve got mail    at its surface  one might assume  the shop around the corner  to simply be the story of two lovers  klara novak  sullavan  and alfred kralik  stewart  who love each other without knowing it  however  lubitsch s film runs much deeper than that  it s the story of matuschek and company  a stylish gift shop in budapest  and the various human relationships that make the store such a close knit family  when store owner hugo matuschek  frank morgan  begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife  we witness the breakdown of two families  both at home and at work  there s absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states   perhaps in the blustery streets of new york   but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe  the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep  this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful  personal touch to the film   in fact  even as i write this review  i m beginning to appreciate the story even more   sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles  but i think that it s the supporting cast that really make the film  each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix  and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable  i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek  who  in any other film  would have been restricted to an underdeveloped  two dimensional portrayal  matuschek may have lost the love of his family  but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees  and you feel a heartwarming glow when  in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm  he finds companionship in a freckle faced young errand boy  charles smith  this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder s later creations  for example  boom boom jackson in  the fortune cookie   or carlo carlucci in  avanti    of course  it doesn t really need saying  but billy wilder learned from the best
