when i sat down to watch  largo winch  i expected nothing more than action scenes and fascinating cars  when i stood up  i ve seen both of these  and more   karl roden was finally not the antagonist in a movie  to start with  kristin scott thomas played her role well  but the real two stars in my opinion were tomer sisley and miki manojlovic  both acting superbly  in radivoje bukvic portrayed goran well   the mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie  but i understand why people would get bored with it   the scenery of hong kong and especially the stunning croatian seaside both amazed me  and i hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island   rolls royce phantom  mercedes s  and bmw   if anyone loves expensive limousine   type cars  this is their movie  it is also a movie for people who love action sequences  good acting  landscapes of extremal beauty  and above all  a fast   paced  well written action movie  with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama   my vote  as it has enlightened a gloomy day is
