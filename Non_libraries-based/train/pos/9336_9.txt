german private tv is ill renowned for copying dutch and   naturally   us formats  well  in the case of edel   starck  the xeroxing only went as far as the basics  screwball   you can t stand screwball comedy  don t watch edel   starck  seriously  if you expect yet another lawyers  drama thingy similar to law order or something  well  go somewhere else   or watch law order as it s quite brilliant at what it does  but i digress  e s is funny  often addresses thought provoking themes  is funny  romantic  funny  funny  and witty  too   frankly  i am quite dismayed the writers didn t get better deals after the serial s final  and my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re  private german television productions  german residents will understand what i m talking about   in short  watch it  i don t have the foggiest what the english synchronisation is like  but hey  it s worth learning german just to watch them four seasons  pseudo happy end included
