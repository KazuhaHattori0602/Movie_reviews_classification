the  st season was amazing  the whole idea of them adjusting to the island  while mysteries were being explored  and seen  was just phenomenal  filled with suspense  tons of cliffhangers  and an amazing plot  i mean  i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island  and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention  from then on  i was hooked the second season was right on par with the  st season  only a little better  i absolutely loved the idea of the hatches and the dharma initiative  the whole plot and sequences of season   were mysterious  creepy  and exciting  i loved all the suspense surround others on the island  but the dharma story really made season   amazing   season   wasn t quite as good as   and     but nonetheless  great  i loved seeing the back stories of the others  seeing their camp  and seeing the mysteries further explored   tricia tanak is dead  is one of my favorite episodes  this season  while not as good  was still breathtaking and fun  but most of all exciting  now  the  th season  i had hopes for this season  and the  st couple of episodes we re good  but then it really started to get boring and monotonous  i mean  i really despise the new  rescuers  such as miles and daniel  the plot got old after the first couple episodes   and most of all   season   was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series  the mystery  suspense  comedy mixed in  charlie gone  and overall excitement  also  some of my favorite characters have left
