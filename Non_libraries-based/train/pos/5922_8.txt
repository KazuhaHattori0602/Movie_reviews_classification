i found this movie to be exciting right from the start like a spielberg movie is and found the plot to be intriguing as i tried to figure out what the actual situation was   right from the start before the opening credits  the action starts  bringing with it immediate suspense   the two main characters are very likable   i have trouble liking any of the baldwins  due to alec s extra curricular  political activities  but william was not too bad in this movie   there were several highly unexpected twists  which contributed to the enjoyment   there were  unfortunately  many places where there was an annoying high pitch sound in the soundtrack something like  k hz  i suspect the microphone was picking up video monitors on the set
