re  pro jury  although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story   one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the  s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to  year old s they barely know  but i doubt it    easily give away virginity  what a shrewd remark about this film  truly   one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations  but my experience has been  more often than not  teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world   you just aren t at all able to see the world other than through your own eyes  that s sad   one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin   the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes   and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake  but i think not    and another  expert  opinion drawn from experience  dandy   one may believe that  something year old troublemakers can enter into  and hang around inside  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this   now be a good sport and tell us at which institution you grew up   one final nit  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome  but because it was never detailed  each reference distracts from each scene   of course there s probably an explanation  good job figuring that out  now i ll be generous and will help you out of your misery  although it was translated as a general  foursome  the word  etvorka  has another meaning  it s a sports term used to designate a  m or  w setup   a rowing crew consisting of   persons    rowers and a coxswain   this movie did not ring true for me   we should all heed to your competent and praiseworthy opinion  dude
