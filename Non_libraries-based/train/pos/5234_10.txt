after going for a bike ride that day  lying beside a lake in a nature reserve  spending half an hour feeding and talking to a donkey who lived in a beautiful field with a small wood in it  this film made absolute sense to me   the imagery of the film was beautiful and that is all you need  switch off the conscious control knob of the mind and job done   reminded me of baraka   but with the added lesson of my previous paragraph   this comment requires a minimum of ten lines  ten lines is the minimum not   lines but ten  after finishing counting all the lines you realise that there are less than ten even though less than ten lines is all that is needed to make my comment
