the woman in black was a british made for tv movie which was first broadcast on the bbc on christmave eve of   and again in   i believe it made a round on american tv on a e  it was released on vhs in britain in the early  s but went out of print  a u s  company released it on dvd later  but that version also sold out  according to the website of the author of the book  the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won t be released again  and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay   i first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out  i found a copy on ebay for about   bucks  it s certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east  even though the dvd says   made in canada  ha ha  but it s a good copy  and you can t really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare  out of print  and lost in legal disputes   i love the movie  it s a period piece set in the  s  with all the very authentic and quaint british settings of that time  the woman in black is very atmospheric and dark  for the most part  the movie is very low key  but effective and scary  there is no self indulgent gore  violence or much at all in special effects  but the woman in black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments  it s a chilling classic styled ghost movie  the movie itself looks like it could have been made in the  s except for the color  without all the flash of all the modern horror movies  i m afraid this film will always just be a lost gem  for me  it places itself as one of my all time favorites
