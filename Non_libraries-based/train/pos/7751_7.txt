i really liked tom barman s awtwb  you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts  and don t expect anything  it s like sitting on a caf terrace with a beer  in the summer sun  and watching the people go by  it definitely won t keep you pondering afterwards  that s true  but that s not a prerequisite for a good film  it s just the experience during the movie that s great   i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more  but being a lynch fan i don t care that much anymore    and i  loved  the style  or flair of this movie  it s slick  but fresh  and the soundtrack is a beauty  any music lover will get his kicks out of awtwb  i can assure you   i ll give it   out     music wise   out of
