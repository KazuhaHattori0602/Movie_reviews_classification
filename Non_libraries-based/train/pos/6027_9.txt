i was told it was one of those  either you love it or you hate it  movies  well  i loved it  obvious hippie era  dated and easy symbolism and all  so  i probably have no taste at all when it comes to antonioni  but this and la notte  made exactly a decade earlier  are my favourites among his movies so far  made two years before i was born  zabriskie point was supposed to have been michelangelo s great american epic  but apparently  it turned out to be a flop  i really can t see why  before watching it i d read that it was rather boring  so i braced myself for a very slow movie   though i love me a slow movie  for my taste  zabriskie didn t have a tedious minute in it  while watching it  i made a mental note of how european it was on the director s part to make such frequent use of advertisement billboards in almost every urban scene  enormous billboards dwarfing any human form in sight  this recurrent visual element is obviously there to underline the way that consumerism crushes the individual in american society  but then i watched l eclisse straight afterwards  which is set in rome in the early  s  and noticed that antonioni often included billboards in it as well  after all  the masterful use of landscapes  architecture and inanimate objects in each frame with or without human beings is an antonioni trademark   this is precisely the way that he evokes his characters  psychological states  with more or less understated power and great visual impact  he is virtually unsurpassed in this skill   zabriskie point starred two very appealing leads that should have become big stars of the  s  but never did  mark frechette  whom i d already seen in francesco rosi s fine wwi set movie uomini contro  had a very tragic life and died aged just   according to his biography page  he donated his   earnings from zabriskie to a commune  mark s co star daria halprin  apparently also dennis hopper s wife later on  has the stunning  natural beauty and appeal of a young ornella muti   one of those luminous beauties that don t need a shred of make up to turn heads  like frechette  she has only graced a couple of obscure movies and has never become a star  but at least she didn t die tragically  most notably  zabriskie point contains one of the most original sex scenes ever filmed   one that brings home a sense of youthful playfulness like few i ve seen   as well as a powerfully cathartic ending  it may be the most banal sequence ever filmed as far as its symbolism goes  but i can t see how anyone can deny its beauty and wonderful sense of emotional release  never has an explosion looked so good  and so poetic  it seems to be an explosion that restores order rather than bringing chaos
