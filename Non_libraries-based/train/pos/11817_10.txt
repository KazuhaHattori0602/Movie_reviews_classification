i saw dick tracy when i was very young  i didn t know who any of the actors were  and i didn t know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed  i sure loved it though   warren beatty stars as the crime fighting  s detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city  this time  big boy caprice  al pacino  has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney  madonna  who has her eye on tracy  it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is  this criminal has no face  he or she is very unknown  plus  the famous villians are back from the comic book collection   i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative  it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child  warren beaty was just like james bond of the  s the way he played dick tracy   an ensemble cast of the film includes  charlie korsmo  glenn headly  william forsythe  dustin hoffman  james caan  ed o  ross  tommy lee jones  mandy patinkin  charles durning  plus more   dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy  take my word for it
