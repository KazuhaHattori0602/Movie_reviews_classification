a very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one  year old guy  that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy  during an vacation with a part of his family   i liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling   with all this  sound close ups  and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods
