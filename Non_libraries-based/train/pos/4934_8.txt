 panic in the streets  is a fairly unknown little movie from director elia kazan and was made before his classic masterpieces such as  a streetcar named desire   on the waterfront  and  east of eden  kazan already won an oscar in   before this movie  so he was not a completely unknown at the time  still  panic in the streets  is mostly a movie that passed under the radar   the great thing about this movie is the oscar winning script  it has a very good concept and its excellent tense thriller material with a sniff of crime film noir elements  the dialog in this movie is also absolutely magnificent and gives the movie a feel of reality and credibility   the cast is fairly unknown  especially at the time it was released  but it still features zero mostel and jack palance in one of their first movie roles  especially palance impresses as the tough gangster boss  with a very powerful looking face   still the movie drags a little at some points  the movie starts of very well but after the start the movie slows down and does not always makes the right decisions in terms of pace and the point of view the story is told from   yet   panic in the streets  remains a perfectly watchable movie  mainly due to its solid script and powerful dialog that makes the movie a believable one to watch  for fans of the thriller genre this is a great movie to watch
