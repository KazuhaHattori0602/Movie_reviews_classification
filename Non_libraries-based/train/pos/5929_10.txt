stephen king was raised on flicks like this   flicks not films   movies like this and  jeepers creepers  are  throwbacks  to the good  ol day drive in horror flicks  they are meant to be fun  cheaply made and hopefully  a few good scares   anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that s all this is  all it ever will be   stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash   good  fun  trash   if you enjoyed this i recommend   jeepers creepers   jeepers creepers     days of night   scarecrows   they live   planet terror   death proof  and  halloween iii  season of the witch
