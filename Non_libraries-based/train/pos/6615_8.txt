i am glad being able to say almost only positive things about the movie with karas and the tasuiev sisters  renaissance   and firstly  that it looks as it ought to look  a boys  adventure  renaissance is the tale of a cop s investigation in search of a missing young scientist ilona tasuiev  the geneticist and researcher for the avalon company   the tale of karas  ilona and bislane is  though much less known than sin city  the better movie  and the one more appreciated by the connoisseurs  to the french comics aficionados it will be even more meaningful  i have enriched my french comics collection last week  though i m not so up to date  the atmosphere  the music  the characters  their lines  the plot are all nice and endearing  a parisian top cop  karas  is displayed to find a young woman who was a rising star of medical genetic research  ilona tasuiev a mildly hot blonde  whose rebel sister bislane was erotically preferable  i guess   for me  an oldie aficionado of comics and tv series  renaissance  a marvelously beautiful cartoon  was like a replay of a wild wild west episode here  a mythological past replaced with an equally mythological future more jaded and blas  but  in a sense  as thrilling  renaissance is not suspenseful  nor does it look especially well paced  but it s seducing and hypnotic  moreover  it achieves sketching  albeit briefly  a world  a true world and we will think about the avalon  nakata  jonas mueller  the tasuiev sisters  and goran  farfella  and karas telling of his distant childhood in kasbah 
  i liked renaissance s feel  of a certain gentleness and affability and adventurousness  and also the professional  assured look  among these new cartoons  this one and linklater s dick adaptation  the only and first dick adaptation ever  stood out for me as works of beauty and genuine excitement   i thought the futuristic devices were appropriate and  when not conventional  vividly eerie  like the invisibility costumes   as advisable  the characters have exotic names  like bislane and farfella  mostly gathered from the arts and entertainment s world  goran and ilona and naghib 
   none seems to have noticed that renaissance s poster features a rourke look alike that guy is marv  which doesn t make it a sin city rip off  but not a paragon of originality either  and in fact there s more resemblance to the miller tale namely  the bleak futuristic look of a decayed society  the brio of the hero  in fact a cross of willis  character and rourke s persona in the previous movie 
 on the other hand  this cartoon breathes a more public air  a brim of straight adventurousness  and  in a word  it s like sin city for kids well  naughtier kids i mean   cause there s a bit of nudity on display  to what i have said one might retort that the traits mentioned are characteristic  even as clich s and common places of the futuristic more adult comics  look  true enough  and it was oldie miller to have brought that things on screen and renaissance bears some resemblances here and there  now it s also fair that every ring ought to have its eragorn  so to each sin city  its renaissance  i admit being quite partial to these bleak futuristic tales  a rather undemanding specialty
