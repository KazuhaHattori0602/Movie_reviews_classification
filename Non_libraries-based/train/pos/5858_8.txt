spider man is in my opinion the best superhero ever  and this game is the best superhero game ever  while it may be somewhat easy  you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic book covers  which makes up for how easy it is to get through the game  it may seem hard to control at first  but once you get the hang of it  you will be web slinging like spider man himself   the bosses  while like the levels are somewhat easy  are fun  the first boss  scorpion  is incredibly easy to beat  which shouldn t be so because as fans of the comic books know  scorpion is one of spider man s most deadly villains  the second boss  rhino  is also very easy  the  rd boss is venom  who is in my opinion the easiest boss in the game  which definately shouldn t be  the  th boss is venom again  this time  he is a little bit more difficult to beat but still easy  the  th boss is mysterio  who i think is the funnest boss to battle in the game  he is also one of the harder bosses  but once again  still fairly easy  next boss is carnage  who is  you guessed it  easy to beat  but carnage is actually kind of fun to fight   th boss is doctor octopus  who is like all the other bosses easy  but not as easy as the other ones because he has a shield  the  th and final boss is exclusive to the game  never in a comic book or cartoon  i won t spoil it for you for those of you who haven t played the game  but the boss is the only boss in the game that isn t too easy  took me   or   tries to beat while the others i beat on the first or second tries   all in all  a very good game  i gave it an   out of   the reasons why i didn t give it a   or   are that once you get all the costumes and comic book covers it gets kind of boring  getting all that stuff will take a while though  it is not very accurate according to the comic books or cartoon show  the bosses are too easy  and they should have used hobgoblin and or green goblin as a boss  i think it would be fun to battle someone flying around in the air  they didn t use them in the sequel to this game either  well the green goblin is the villain in the upcoming spider man movie  so hopefully they will make a video game based on the movie
