i ve seen this film on sky cinema not too long ago  i must admit  it was a really good western which features   of the big names  on one side  there s charlton heston  playing the infamous and retired lawman samuel burgade  on the other  the late james coburn playing the villainous zach provo  seeking revenge on burgade no matter what the cost   the good thing about this film was there was some really good characters  most of the actors played it out really well  especially james coburn  who i find that he was really mean in this film  but that how it was   christopher mitchum  who i ve seen everywhere in other films  playing hal brickman  i felt his character was left out in the cold  but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with burgade  to bring down provo s posse s   all in all  it was a great film  very good to watch  great score from the late jerry goldsmith   wonderful piece of western persona    out of
