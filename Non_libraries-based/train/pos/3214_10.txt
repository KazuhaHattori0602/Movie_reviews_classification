i fell in love with this silent action drama  kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well  raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting  todd  kurt russell  is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers   the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born   soldier  not rambo  not schwarzenegger  not bruce willis  not mel gibson  not jason statham   kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his   original  daring  and all too human  i miss the fact that sequels were never made       ld  _________  my faith
