as winter approaches  our state owned broadcaster  the abc  has decided for some reason to have a partial jane austen festival on sunday nights  this commenced with a twelve year old movie length version of  emma  last sunday  more recent versions of three other novels   persuasion   northanger abbey  and  mansfield park  are to come   the curious thing about this production by a e television networks  with script by the ever reliable andrew davies  is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions  one starring gwyneth paltrow  and  clueless  a  modernized  version  starring alicia silverstone  which transported the plot to beverly hills  perhaps as a result  even with kate beckinsale in the lead  this production sank without trace   as a general rule  much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length  the adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters  an outstanding example is  brideshead revisited  which had    minute episodes back in   you only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of  pride and prejudice  in   with the brilliant   six part tv mini series  it s not that a novel should be filmed page by page  and some novels  often not very good ones  adapt wonderfully to film  atonement  is a recent example  but novels of the jane austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm   given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation  this production is ok  kate beckinsale gives emma the right mix of self assuredness and vulnerability and mark strong is a forthright mr knightly  he reminded me that jane tended to recycle characters   knightly is a more articulate version of the moody mr darcy of p p  samantha morton was a rather limp harriet but prunella scales got the blabbermouth miss bates perfectly   sybil fawlty on speed  bernard hepton as emma s feeble father was also excellent  we saw the damp countryside  the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors  in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody   even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places   some of the conversations were rather stilted  even allowing for the formalities of the times  i d have to look at the film again to be sure  but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots   if you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example  and compares well with the paltrow version  anyway  there is more to come
