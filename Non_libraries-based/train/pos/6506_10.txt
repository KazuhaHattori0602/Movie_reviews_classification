utterly brilliant  powerful and evocative  the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war  it s tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung ho attitude towards world war   that the media exhibits  rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war  it allows sir laurence olivier s quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war  corpses everywhere  explosions  terrified citizens and soldiers  broken men  indifferent politicians  mistakes that cost thousands of lives  the suffering of the innocents  most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of  civility  are removed  there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature  he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate   years on  perhaps there could be a follow up series called  the century at war  for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors  i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of   million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this
