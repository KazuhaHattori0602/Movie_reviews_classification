i found grey garden s to be a gripping film  an amazingly intimate  look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea  forget  society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge  brood of cats and raccoons  persuing their own interests rather  mundainly  all the while chattering at the camera   big edie and little edie are the two crazies that the mazles bros   have chosen to document  they seem like characters out of a  fellini film  only stranger  if that makes any sense  old edie is  almost fully bedridden  a pile of papers  clothes and dirty dishes  growing around her  little edie is even more interesting  she  prances around the house  always wearing a baboushka like  headdress around her head  completely covering her hair  we  never see her hair throughout the film  nor do we ever get a hint  that she still has much  at age fifty eight  though  she is still  beautiful and full of life   in grey gardens  we get the sense that both of these women s  lives have become much less than what they once were  little  edie is probably the sadder of the two  while her mother  in her  earlier years  got married  made a family  lived luxuriously and  even made some recordings  the scene where  at   she sings  along with a recording of  tea for two  she made decades ago is  one of the films best scenes  edie left her promicing career as a  model to take care of her ailing mother  at   she still longed to  find her prince charming  if anything little edie is still a little girl   full of dreams of glamour and fame  and of domestic and romantic  bliss  that have yet to be fulfilled   highlights of the film include the opening moments  where little  edie explains her outfit to the camera  the  tea for two  sequence   the birthday party  the climactic argument  the grocery deliver  scene  and the scene in the attic  the whole thing is incredibly  candid and unpretencious  and it s made all the more remarcable  since it s all real   i suggest seeing grey gardens back to back with the kenneth  anger short puce moment  the criterion dvd is   but it s  worth every penny
