 foxes  is a serious look at the consequences of growing up too fast in the  s  and unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it  porky s  fast times at ridgement high  the movie holds up well against time   its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was   years ago and jodie foster and sk er boi scott baio  remember him  lead a fine young cast that s well worth watching   the film follows four southern california girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and devoid of parents  the teens spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties  concerts  or out on the street  seldom are they home because instant gratification is a pill  party  or boy away   but rather than condemning them  the film is sympathetic  blaming absent  uncaring adults for forcing the teens to grow up alone  and the charismatic cast is impossible to dislike   the film s opening   a long and loving pan   sets the tone for what follows  we see the girls asleep at daybreak amid the objects that define teen girlhood  from twinkies to a picture of a young john travola  while donna summer s  on the radio  is scored beneath   from there the movie picks up speed as the girls head off to school and to life  annie  runaway rocker cherie currie  is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill  deirdre  kandice stroh  is the boy crazy drama queen  madge  marlilyn stroh  is the shy girl in over her head  and foster is the one with the plan  it s her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while also holding her divorced and desperate man hunting mother in line  sally kellerman   it s an almost impossible job and one that foster ultimately fails at   despite its age   foxes  remains a pleasure to watch  dated hair  clothes  and references to olympic skater dorothy hamill haven t hurt the movie   the cinematography is simply stunning  with breathtaking filtered shots of the l a  basin at dawn  dusk and at night  giorgio moroder adds a  s soundtrack featuring the likes of donna summer and janis ian   perhaps the movie s biggest disappointment is that the young stars around foster never broke out like the casts of  st  elmo s fire    or  empire records     foxes  shows why they should have  but perhaps like bowling for soup s song   they just hit a wall
