i saw this movie recently    hours later  my head still hurt from laughing  the plot was soo awful  the jokes were soo bad  but what i didn t count on were     the   scenes before and after the movie that had pat and jay posing  that caused more than enough laughter     the kick through the windshield that decapitated the evil doer   this movie is about   times better than the rush hour series  and my copy even came with a disclamer saying if you didn t like the movie  send certificate to hbo  while i considered it  the date you had to send it in was january    which also caused wackiness to ensue
