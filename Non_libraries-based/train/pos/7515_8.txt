i ve known about bettie page for many a year now  the soft core porn images of her from the  s have since become iconographic and still have a strong draw even today  the  bettie page  look is also still hugely popular within the hetero fetish world and remains as distinctive today as it did then  so i watched this film with quite a bit of familiarity to begin with  the result did not disappoint   among other things  it was hugely entertaining to see the movie s recreation of actual figures like irving klaw  john willie  and bunny yeager   all consider trailblazers today  mary harron did an excellent job creating the desired ambiance of sexual repression and hypocrisy in  s america along with a sexuality that  by today s standards  was innocent in the extreme  i particularly liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate bettie found herself in   i think that gretchen mol did an excellent job of presenting the character of bettie in all her innocent sexuality and all her utter naivet  bettie loved to look pretty  loved the attention  saw nothing wrong with nudity  and enjoyed dressing up in  silly outfits  for the camera  the underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires all that evoked were completely lost on her  to this day she still doesn t understand  what all the fuss was about  when it comes to her pictures or the s m content of them   this isn t to say she s uneducated or too simple to understand it s just that she simply doesn t  get it  about fetishism and never will  no harm there  bettie page is simply being who she is  the film captured this quite nicely   the social atmosphere of the  s depicted by ms  harron and written by her along with guinevere turner makes me truly glad i live in the day and age that i do  the hypocrisy and repression combined with the massive ignorance about our sexuality all combined to a frighteningly stifling world  the film well captures this and brings to cheering as bettie endures it all with her unshakeable faith and her unchangeable naivet   this film was a bit slow at times but hit all the points ms  harron attempted and hit them well  i d recommend this film even for those folks with little to no knowledge of who bettie page was and what effect she had on american culture  for those with such interests  then this film is a must see
