how can anyone argue the fact that urban cowboy was  and still is  the best document of texas life for the time period  consider the following  men beat their wives  get drunk at bars nightly  get married to settle a fight  commit adultery  and compete on mechanical bulls  try and name a movie that depicts real life so vividly  they dont make them anymore  it seems current films are always about people with lots of money  they live in huge homes  drive expensive cars and don t work  this movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for pete s sake    anyway  i watch it at least once a week  no kidding  i have dissected this movie from end to end  feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary  consider the following scenes  bud sees sissy   they are split up   he amicably honks and waves  she flips him the bird   he returns half the peace sign honking his horn to add impact then tears off   buds mom calls him approx    hours after he gets into town  on a sunday  to see if he has a job yet   all he has accomplished is getting drunk and laid x  with help from his uncle and aunt who cover for him    you all live like pigs  think about why this scene is needed  think about it  was it necessary   could we not figure it out without showing the filthy sink   god i love that    sissy allows wes to help her ride the bull  only a few days  or possibly the next day  after wes just kicked the crap out of her husband  steve asks   hey sissy  remember wes   oh yeah  didnt you beat my husband up the other night  so let s get this lesson goin  to make no mention of the fact that she seeks solace in him later during one bud and sissy s many fights  which by the way all take place in public   in gilley s    the wedding reception picture taking session  oh the humanity   could they at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way   my legs are sweatin  momma   in conclusion  you don t put scenes like this in a movie to try and show insight into human psychology  it is a documentary of real life   i only wish there was a director s cut
