that  s show is the best tv show ever  period  it s up there with the andy griffen show  saturday night live  and the simpsons in my book  that  s show continued on for   seasons  all of which focus around a group of teenagers young adults dealing with relationships  separating from their parents  and their overall futures   the two main characters  eric and donna  are two teenagers living next door to each other  they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives  and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season  a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working   two other characters  red and kitty  are eric s parents  red was in the service  so he really pushes eric around  kitty is just the opposite  even though she drinks heavily  she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care  bob  their neighbor  is obviously donna s dad  bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show s story  bob also annoys red to his full extent   the remaining character  hyde  kelso  fez  and jackie  are eric s friends  they also play a major role in the show s story   well  the first season is great  this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other  the first season is original  funny  and enjoyable   the second season is good  although it isn t as good as the first  it is a basic continuation of the first  eric and donna are together  and everything is working out great   the third season is my favorite  it went back and captured the first season feel and humor  i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch  making the show all that more fun to watch   the fourth season isn t near as good  eric and donna arne t together in this one  making the show slightly less pleasurable  it is still funny  although i didn t enjoy it as much as the previous seasons   the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through  it is the gang s senior year  so that really helps with the story  the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons   the sixth season is good for the most part  it is extremely funny  although it doesn t capture the feel that the other seasons did  the gang is out of high school  so i believe that it didn t hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did  i also didn t like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them   the seventh season captures the same feel that the  th season had in a way  although it didn t do it all the way  i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others  and the ending is great   the last season flat out sucked  eric wasn t in it  which ruined it  kelso wasn t in it for the most part either  which didn t help  i hated the eighth season up until the last episode  i thought that the last episode was really good  and a fitting ending to the series   so overall  if you enjoy comedy  give that  s show a try  they stopped making new episodes  but it is still on tv a bunch  i also recommend buying seasons   it is up to you if you want to buy season
