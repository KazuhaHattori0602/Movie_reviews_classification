secret sunshine   is famous for its awards at the festival de cannes in   and other film festivals  jeon do yeon  who played the newly widowed shin ae  won the best actress trophy at the  th cannes festival  secret sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and jeon do yeon received a best actress nod from asia pacific screen awards  in addition  this movie won the best film awards in virtually all korean film festivals  masterfully written and directed  and uniquely photographed  secret sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy  this film also talked about the forgiveness of god and people  lee chang dong  director and writer of this movie  said in an interview   in a vast sense  i wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense  without love  we can t talk about hope and salvation  lee acknowledged that secret sunshine had no apparent genre  this movie is not a movie about religion  but it drew attention from many christians in korea because there were a lot of christian elements in the movie   the turning point in secret sunshine comes when jun  shin ae s son  is kidnapped and killed  the kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land  she must be rich  her lie causes much sorrow   shin ae becomes a church goer and wants to forgive the murderer  she decides to visit her son s murderer in prison and forgive him  jong chan  shin ae s guy friend  says   just forgive in your heart  do you have to go to the prison  her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her  her pastor agrees with what she wants to do  that is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action  the result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in shin ae s life  the murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by god  this sparks anger in her toward god  she says   how could you forgive the man before i forgive    she begins to fight against god  she looks up to the sky and proclaims   i won t lose to you  she becomes a snare  her heart is a trap  and her hands are chains  it is more bitter than death  she becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital  on the day shin ae is discharged from the hospital  she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face  the daughter of her son s murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair  the murderer s daughter has helped kidnapped shin ae s son  while she cuts shin ae s hair  the protagonist can t understand what s going on and gets out of the shop quickly   it is difficult not to talk about jong chan in the movie  jong chan does his best to be by shin ae s side  although shin ae doesn t care about him at all  he is beside her all the time  shin ae leaves church quickly  but jong chan  who started attending church because of shin ae  stays there because he feels peace with god  lee chang dong  the director of secret sunshine  says that jong chan is like milyang  secret sunshine  the rural city or vice versa  he seems to  be too secular and frivolous  but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her  milyang is like him  mr  lee adds   someone joked that jong chan could be an angel  i think that he could be the angel  who knows  we can t say for sure that there is no angel  if there is a person like jong chan who forever accompanies his lover s twists and turns  we can defend ourselves against the overpowered  the life of shin ae is full of meaninglessness  her husband died after he cheated on her  and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband s hometown  and her soul was damaged because she learned christianity in a wrong way and that makes her crazy  literally  it is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness  does she still have hope in her life  can she find meaning in her life  the final scene gives us hope  shin ae tries to cut her hair by herself  we walk our life s journey by ourselves  she  however  realizes that it is hard to do it by herself  and we know that we can t do everything by ourselves  we see jong chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair  that s her hope  she has jong chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is  as i mentioned earlier  jong chan is like an angel for her  if we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us  we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives    secret sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in korea  it is like da vinci code  while da vinci code helps us discuss the early church history  secret sunshine prompts us to deal with life s messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable  with a shallow interpretation of the movie  people misunderstand christianity and its theology  with a deeper interpretation  this movie will help us see beneath the surface  some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched secret sunshine  and lee chang dong responds by saying   they were already anti christ before they watched this movie  secret sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through shin ae s life
