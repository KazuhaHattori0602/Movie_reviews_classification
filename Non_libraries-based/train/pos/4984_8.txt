 secret of the lens  is perhaps a pretty campy all time favorite of mine  the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki  who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai ecchi anime  i wish he did more campiness like this   my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence  the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen  the party riots that bill causes  one of the funniest scenes  and whenever my favorite character  worsle appears   check this out   warning this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans
