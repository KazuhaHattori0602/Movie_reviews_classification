first of all  the release date is   not   for this feature length nature documentary film  it should be more properly referred to as   earth    secondly  allow me to address the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the  planet earth  tv series of     i have not seen this tv series  but learned here  that this film is the full length version of this   tv series  i judge any film  on it s own merits  not by it s source  i judge the results  on their own  and the results of  earth    are indeed excellent  i dismiss this trivial complaint of some reviewers  that it s simply an expanded version of the   tv series  planet earth  so what  it doesn t really matter   as a film buff and one who has viewed dozens of nature documentaries in my lifetime  i was astonished and highly impressed by  earth    this is the debut film from the new  disneynature  division of disney and follows in the footsteps of walt disney s pioneering and academy award winning nature documentary films of the  s and  s   cinematography  film editing  music score  sound and narration are all excellent  there have been a few other nature documentaries that also excelled in these categories  what really sets  earth    apart is its  scope  it literally covers the entire planet  covering all seven continents   after my first viewing  it was obvious this documentary film required a massive effort and amount of time and talent to create    three production companies were required to make this amazing documentary film    earth    convincingly tells the stories of four species on their great migrations as it spans one year through the seasons beginning in january and ending in december  from the north pole to the south pole   two special new high tech cameras were used for this film  one camera has a   degree computer controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is a hd camera set to an amazing   frames per second  this filming technique really added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of  earth    especially the cheetah chase and great white sharks leaping out of the water to catch sea lions and an aerial view going over the edge of the world s highest waterfall  there are many stunningly beautiful shots in this documentary   via cinematography  music score and narration  there is drama  sadness  humor and great beauty in this documentary  with a great music score performed by the world renowned berliner philharmoniker  excellent creative and technical cinematography and james earl jones narration  i consider  earth    as the greatest nature feature length documentary film ever made   five years of hard work  patience  talent and dedication really paid off very well here  this film should be required viewing in all schools throughout the world  i predict an academy award for best documentary feature  among other awards  truly  an amazing  astonishing  exhilarating and magnificent documentary film   very highly recommended
