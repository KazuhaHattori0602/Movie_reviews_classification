i am completely shocked that this show had been cancelled ity only lasted one year i just recently started watching it and i love it its a show that could of gone as far as friends went it had the humour and was extremely enjoyable   it is about   brothers and   sisters living under one roof without their parents kurt joey lawrence  plays the part of the oldest sibling and takes on the more fatherly role   this should of lasted much more than year as it was fantastic  amazing show with all the best actors
