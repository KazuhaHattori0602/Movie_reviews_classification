walt disney s  the rookie  is based on the story of jim morris  a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history  ending an almost   year retirement and making his major league debut in   at the age of    the film opens with a brief synopsis of morris  childhood  which included a series of re locations   his father was a military man  and even when his family settled for good in football crazed texas  morris  passion for baseball remained strong   the childhood segment then jumps ahead about   years to the adult morris  played by dennis quaid  who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at big lake high school  in real life it was reagan county high school in big lake  texas  it is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it didn t work out   morris s team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams  they turn the table on him  telling him that he should try out for a major league team  at several times when he pitches to them in practice  they express amazement at the speed with which he throws  morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district  he will try out for a major league team   big lake does win district and  adhering to his end of the deal  morris attends a tampa bay devil rays try out  phenomenally  he throws   miles an hour   faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a major league pitcher  after another try out with the team  morris is offered a contract with the devil rays   this leaves him with a tough decision   stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his major league dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home  and the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children   morris signs with the devil rays  begins at the aa level and moves up quickly to the aaa level  one level below major league baseball  but as the season winds down  the chances of him getting  called up  grow increasingly slim   for the most part  i love this movie  there are lots of great performances and likable characters and it s easy to find yourself really pulling for morris  also  the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels  and most of all  it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve   still  the movie has some flaws  while generally accurate  it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things  check out   for some examples  also  except for one scene in which he prays with his players  the movie completely ignores morris  christian faith  but considering disney s left wing zeal  that s not surprising   presumably  a lot of the exaggerations fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic  yet the   minute documentary on morris that is included on the dvd features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie   for example  from birth until his family settled in texas for good when he was   morris re located   times  and his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left  pitching  shoulder  thus making his throwing   mph even more inexplicable   to fully appreciate and understand the story of jim morris  it s good to not only watch  the rookie  but to watch the dvd s documentary  check out the aforementioned link to the movie s inaccuracies and probably also to read morris  biography  also titled  the rookie  i haven t read the book but i hope to one of these days   but overall   the rookie  is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man
