i think  blackadder the third  is the best one of the series   actuelly all the episodes are funny  personally i really like the episode with the  french invasion  but the one with the superstitious actors  in  macbeth  is also really funny  the way rowan keeps playing on with them is really  english  humor at the highest level   actors   never say that again  always call it the scottish play  blackadder  oh  so you want me to say the scottish play  actors  yes blackadder  rather than macbeth   i am a big fan of rowan and i have the majority of his work  but i think he did the series of blackadder especially good   i hope rowan is going to continue his great style  but i think we can count on him  because he is already working on a bean   movie  that will be out this year  i can t wait   i give this  rd blackadder a   out of   rating
