a scanner darkly  minority report  blade runner  sin city and sky captain and the world of tomorrow   if you are a fan of any of these then this will be well worth checking out   french animation project  renaissance  took seven years to make on a shoestring budget and tonight i finally got to see it at a private screening for the international film festival in stockholm  my spontaneous reaction is awe  my further reflection is  huh  neat  and closer analysis regrettably gets a resounding  meh  it is a gorgeous science fiction triumph on the surface  but scratch it or even poke it a little and its unnecessarily complex plot becomes glaringly apparent  as do the flat characters    nevertheless it is clear that the people at onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface  the visuals are staggering  they have used live action motion capture fitted into key frame animation  with stark jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavily shadowed rotoscoped background  for those of you who are not down with the  technical lingo  the film looks like a fully animated sin city  its fluid  transparent  dark and stylized template is complemented by great lurid lightning  it s a vision  yet much credit is also due to the crisp sound effects that take the form of humming futuristic weapons  suspenseful music  heavy raindrops and glass shards breaking  it s every tech nerd s wet dream   the film zooms in on an eerily lit  bleak  futurescape paris in which a major corporation called  avalon  has begun to interweave in the lives of the citizens with surveillance  think the fluid transparent screens from minority report  and genetic engineering  the latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher ilona  voiced by the lovely romola garai  cut to our hard boiled cop on suspension and protagonist karas  daniel craig    a man who takes the law into his own hands   who is assigned the case of finding and retrieving ilona  during this case  he is being aided by illona s sister with whom he also begins a love affair  a very half assed love affair  if i may say so   the world of renaissance is remarkable  director christian volckman takes a fair jab at melting the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle filled with cads  rats  femme fatales and lonely detectives that hide in the shadows of the seedy slum  the problem is that the creators undoubtedly felt the need to have extremely clear and spelled out archetypes in the story  or the film would have been  too surreal  for mainstream audiences  owing to its lurid animation format  it follows then that we have a multitude of clich d characters such as evil laughing villains  sleazy crime bosses and butch tough chicks who blow smoke every chance they get  it shoves noir in our faces  and it isn t necessary   what is worse is that the dialogue is a little contrived  it seems as though every line exists for the sole reason of propelling the plot  this is nothing fatal because the plot is so complex once it gets going that it needs some clear direction  daniel craig helps here too by bringing a no nonsense attitude to his hard edged cop character  at one point in renaissance  he is seen in a vivid car chase that surely is one of the most adrenaline pumping and top notch sequences of the film  unfortunately  the novelty of the sci fi visuals have worn off post this car chase and  renassaince  could benefit from being slightly shorter  in summary  a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience     out of
