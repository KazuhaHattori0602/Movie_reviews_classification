im a huge m lillard fan that s why i ended up watching this movie  honestly i doubt that if he wasn t in the movie i would of enjoyed it as much or even watched it but once i did watch it realize the story was pretty decent  a bad ending i must say but i did see it coming  it s a low budget movie and some of the actors weren t really good but all in all i rated this movie    the suspense of wondering what lillard was actually up to was what really keeped me interested in this movie   its a good rental
