i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video  i am a big nut for sci fi action flicks though anyway   without giving any of the story away  it is worth seeing if you like sci fi without requiring much thought  the story is basic  and the plot is very good  worth your time to see   maybe they will make a sequel       out of
