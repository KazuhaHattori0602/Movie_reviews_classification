one of the best documentaries released in recent years  some points     hugo chavez was elected venezuela s president in   his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela     in   a coup briefly deposed chavez  at the time  irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o briain were in caracas  shooting a documentary about chavez for british television  their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath  and electrifyingly records history unfolding on the spot  outside and inside the presidential palace     chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free market policies imposed on it by the us  though venezuela s oil was already state owned  it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace     despite being the world s fourth largest oil supplier  venezuela remains swamped by poverty  its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations     the documentary begins by portraying chavez s first years as president before the coup  it focuses on his popularity with the poor  and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals  educational plans  distribution of the oil revenue  grass root democracy etc     chavez was a huge proponent of education  and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution  encouraging children and adults to study and understand it     when chavez came to power  he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits  this  understandably  made the oil companies nervous     a media war broke out  the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state run tv station  they questioned chavez s motives  sanity and sexual orientation     without media support  the coup would not have been successful  the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated     under the guise of  re establishing democracy  the opposition silenced the state run tv station  dissolved the national electoral board  supreme court  national assembly and took control of the military     moneyed interests  backed by the military elite  encouraged by the us and cia  organised a citizens  march on the presidential palace to effect the coup  snipers shot at ch vez supporters  but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted     police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters  further bloodying the streets     chavez  held captive  refused to resign  of course the media government then lied  saying he had resigned  but chavez s cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community  which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv     the people rose up  pressuring the return of the president they had elected  whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace       at a little over an hour long  this doc is far too short  nevertheless  its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of  media warfare  which rarely gets touched upon  makes a great companion piece to  the battle of algiers   worth one viewing
