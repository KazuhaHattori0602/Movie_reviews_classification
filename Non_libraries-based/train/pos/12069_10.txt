yes  it s flawed   especially if you re into hollywood films that demand a lot of effects  a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot  and you can t actually think for yourself   roeg s films are for the intelligent film goer  and insignificance is a perfect example   the characterizations are brilliant  the story is excellent  but  like all nic roeg s films   it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before  his films always make you think  and personally  i like that in a film   so don t expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy happy  because it s likely you ll be disappointed   but i think it s excellent
