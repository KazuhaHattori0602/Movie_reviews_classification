i m going to keep this review short and sweet   i saw the trailer for this and thought i d give it a whirl   minutes in and my initial thoughts were  what the hell is this  but after   minutes i was hooked and after   i was picking my jaw up from off the floor  this film is a great example of how different a movie can be  and furthermore it s french  this film is high art eye candy wrapped up in a tidy futuristic film noir package  the motion capture is very clever and the black and white animation style which has no grey although at first didn t do it for me totally captivated me and by the end of the film and i found myself wishing every film was made like this  i think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing it would have been very easy to ruin it had they not landed so many respected actors as many voice actors give no feeling to the characters  just watch any hong kong legends film in english to see a perfect example i gave it   although i gave it an extra   because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels
