this has got to be the best movie i ve ever seen   combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot  and you have a masterpiece   dog bite dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes  recoiling in horror during others  and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending   the film left a deep impression on me  it s shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender  love  scenes  the film is undeserving of it s cat iii  nudity  rating  there are no nude scenes whatsoever  and the  love  scenes do not even involve kissing or  making out   the message which this film presented to me  all human beings  no matter how violent or cruel they may seem  have a tender side  edison chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous pang   i rate this film   it s a must watch
