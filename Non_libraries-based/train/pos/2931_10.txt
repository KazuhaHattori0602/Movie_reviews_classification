eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life  when i saw it for the first time about   years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it  to date i have seen it a further   times and i still laugh my ass off each time  for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar  there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in   which goes flat during the middle  if you are not the sort of person who can t stand swearing then i wouldn t advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every   seconds  i gave this a   out of   because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best
