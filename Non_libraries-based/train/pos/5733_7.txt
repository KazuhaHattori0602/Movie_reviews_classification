i m gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this  however  the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies  it s definitely something that most people will not get  as is the nature of absurdism   the animation is horrible  but yes  that s the point  the main character is foul mouthed  violent  and stupid  no redeeming qualities whatsoever  his wife shrieks and wails  apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills  most of these stories completely lack any kind of point   but again  that s the point    if non sequiters  foul language  and complete and utter randomness are your thing  you re going to love this   it is really short  so i would probably rent instead of buying
