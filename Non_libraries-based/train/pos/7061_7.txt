of course  the original is better  but this isn t as bad as everyone says  yes  it is made up into   stories  but hey  so what  i thought it was quite good to be honest  i actually liked how anastasia changed a little when she fell in love  it shows what love can do  the stories were not so bad either   i liked cinderella s voice better in this too  i have nothing against her voice in the original  but i just think it sounds better here  more nicer  i liked her personality in this too  she had more of a backbone  yet she was still kind   so  i ll give cinderella ii dreams come true a
