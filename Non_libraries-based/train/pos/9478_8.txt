this is a nice little movie with a nice story  that plays the most important role in the entire movie   it s a quite intriguing dramatic story  with also romance present in it  the story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up  the characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors  normally i m not a too big fan of the asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good   of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies  produced in the west  in a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era   i only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better  for a movie that is considered a kind of an art house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences  this was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically  not that this is a bad thing  it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre   but oh well  this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it  in that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint
