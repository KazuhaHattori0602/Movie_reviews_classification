the only show i have watched since   why did they discontinue it  it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all  the least they should do is release it on dvd    i checked out similar shows  but nothing has come close  the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation    they made a big mistake by pulling that show  if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here  thanks  aloha
