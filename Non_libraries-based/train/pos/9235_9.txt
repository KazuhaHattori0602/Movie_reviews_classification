flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored  this is an intelligent and complex film  beautifully realized and   surprise   pretty damn accurate  this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it s about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well  flavia is a beautiful  th century adolescent  forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent  she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she s female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this  after a fruitless attempt to escape  she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent   flavia is a downright mesmerizing film  almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing  i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer feminism more intensely than flavia does  several sequences are quite shocking  on the verge of nightmarish  actually  as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes  torture and mutilation  yet all this raw footage isn t just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds  mind you  i m strongly convinced that they re part of the statement  flavia  is trying to communicate  humanity  the catholic church in particular  historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there s no use in denying it any further  films like  flavia  the heretic  have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it  flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance  but it s even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography  the glorious costumes   scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani  florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it s mar a casares who steals the show as sister agatha  she s a man hating and loud mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field  amen  sister
