i know  that s not what you expect from a film with this sort of  lineage  it s a direct descendant of the best years of our lives  and the men  films dealing with men who are in the hospital  dealing with tragic circumstances  but this film is full of wonderful  surprises and performances  it features stellar performances from  eric stoltz and helen hunt  including a rather risque nude scene   and wesley snipes and william forsythe  as emanuel levy wrote  in his book cinema of outsiders  about the independent film  movement   the waterdance is coherant  attentive to detail  and  unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor  it  s at once  funny and sad  and the entire cast is impressive  i was  extraordinarily moved by this film  it s hard hitting yes  but also has  very tender moments and laugh out loud moments  a rare gem
