when i saw this movie i was stunned by what a great movie it was  this is the only movie i think i would ever give a   star rating  i am sure this movie will always be in my top    the acting is superb  leonardo dicaprio and kate winslett are at their best  i don t think anyone could have a better job than kate    if it is a rainy day and you can t decide what to rent  well  this is the one  you will love all the acting  special effects  and much much more   if you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now  you won t regret it
