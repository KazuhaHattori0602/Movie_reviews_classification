i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc   version  which is brilliant  the   was adapted by arthur hopcraft  who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year   i remember great acting  especially from rigg and elliott  and moving music   music in the   version is far more understated  but very telling  just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points  richard carstone is ada claire s boyfriend  not esther s  esther had no uncle  charlie drake never played krook in either version  nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss  krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the   version  toby was played by bernard hepton   both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens  great novel  now read the book  it s not perfect  and the sentimentality may make you wince at times  but i defy you not to cry   and laugh
