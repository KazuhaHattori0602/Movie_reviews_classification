this is an amazing movie from   although the first hour isn t very interesting  for the modern viewer  the stylish vision of the year   that comes afterwords makes up for it  however  don t plan on being able to understand all of the dialog   the sound quality and accents  it s american   but  s  american  make it difficult   basically  the story is a sweeping   year look at a fictional us town called  everytown  it spans from   when a war is on the horizon  to   when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems   the first one hour is a bit slow   although it s tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought  the events  suspense and visuals are pretty low key in today s terms  however  when it gets to the future  it s just plain fun to watch  the large sets and retro sci fi look of everything is hard to beat   unless you have great listening abilities  this movie is hard to listen to  i think i understood only   of the dialog  it could use closed captioning   if you re a sci fi fan  this is one of the genre s classics and is a must see  well  at least after the first hour  for the average viewer  wait until there s a closed caption version and then watch it if you re comfortable with movies of this time period
