i have just watched the whole   episodes on dvd  the acting throughout is excellent   no question  there was not quite enough action for me i must say  no real suspense as such  just plenty of first class character development  nothing like tinker tailor in terms of  whodunnit  if you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you  peter egan as the lead magnus pym is excellent   the film portrayed the life of a traitor  a man who should have been a loyal member of the british intelligence service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things  as a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time   time again as a crook and a con man  pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him  wife  son  mentor  pym is fatally damaged by his father s influence   it has eaten his moral fibre away  he has no real love or loyalty in him   heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the   hour series  very well done though
