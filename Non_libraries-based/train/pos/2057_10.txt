there wasn t a day in   where i wasn t chased by a scarecrow i felt that this film handled a serious issue well  it brought back a lot of memories as it was so realistic  even today i have nightmares about corn on the cob  and can t even go near the tinned stuff in fear of my life  i have to admit though  at one point in the film i did have to turn it off as it hit too close to home  for those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow  by watching this film you could be educated about how it felt for us victims   this film teaches us not to take life for granted or to mess with corn  believe me  i ve been there and i have the scars   watch the film  its amazing and educational
