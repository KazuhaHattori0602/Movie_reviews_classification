it does come out of left field  and really isn t what you re expecting  but i love that  the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised  if you ask me  if you haven t been tipped off about the mysterious  thing  that makes these brothers so odd you re in for a treat   the cast is fantastic  but not stretching so much that it s palpable  the special effects come out of nowhere  seriously  it s like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do   then wow  and they re great  the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes  the editing and sound are very good quality  and the twisted story unfolds without clich s  while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster  the  what the hell  factor alone makes it a film treasure   the people who bash this movie make no sense  it s one of those often overlooked flicks of the  s that you ve either never heard of  or love so much you jump at the mention of its title   i m in the latter group
