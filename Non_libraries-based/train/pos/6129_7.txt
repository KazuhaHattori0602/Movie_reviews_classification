note that i did not say that it is better just more enjoyable  the lack of social commentary and realism helps keep things moving   i was actually sort of surprised that this was not a troma movie  as it has all the troma trademarks  including spewing acidic liquids  wisecracks from the villain after every murder  a ridiculous bathtub rape scene  which is sort of hard to get upset about  since the rapist is a snowman  and dumb deputies   there s a lot to love      a snowman  about whom it is remarked that he has no legs or feet  drives a police cruiser around town     even though it is supposed to be close to  or below  freezing  nobody s breath shows and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running     the snow reminds you more of flocking or styrofoam peanuts than actual snow     a teenage girl gets the hots for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother is gruesomely murdered  she talks him into breaking into the sheriff s house  of all places  in order to get it on  but first  she tells him that he has to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open some wine     after teen aged jake s head is cut off by a sled runner  his father argues with the sheriff about whether tommy  the sheriff s son  had anything to do with it  the sheriff maintains that tommy wouldn t have been fighting with jake because jake  is at least two feet taller than tommy  at that moment  someone in the background chimes in   not anymore      when the evil snowman finally starts to melt away  the sheriff wrestles with a flat snowman made out of some sort of fabric for an extended period  this is much better than tarzan wrestling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators wrestling with stuffed lions  if i were an actor  i would not have been able to keep a straight face at this point   all in all  a fun film  there s not really even that much blood
