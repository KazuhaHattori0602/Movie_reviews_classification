this was soul provoking  i am an iranian  and living in th  st century  i didn t know that such big tribes have been living in such conditions at the time of my grandfather   you see that today  or even in   on one side of the world a lady or a baby could have everything served for him or her clean and on demand  but here   years ago  people ventured their life to go to somewhere with more grass  it s really interesting that these persians bear those difficulties to find pasture for their sheep  but they lose many the sheep on their way   i praise the americans who accompanied this tribe  they were as tough as bakhtiari people
