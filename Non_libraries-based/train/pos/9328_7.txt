the perfect son is a story about two  something brothers  one who is seemingly  perfect  and the other who is basically a screw up  frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers  after the death of their father  the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces  it isn t until the  perfect  brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order  and take some responsibility   the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother s  comeback  though it may seem a bit far fetched at times  beating drug addiction is never so easy  what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids  a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last   years  and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well done  the two main actors were both very competent  if not terribly charismatic   a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids  the ending is nicely done as well
