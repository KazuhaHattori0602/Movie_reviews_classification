this movie is amazing  the plot was just wow   i was very surprised by gackt s and hyde s performance  after growing up in the american world of the actors who can t sing and singers who can t act   in this movie  a young sho  gackt  comes across a vampire  kei  hyde  over time  they form an unlikely friendship  kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others  the half life of a vampire   it s a sad movie  but not sappy  the plot was very unique  and contrary to your typical vampire flick  the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing   the only fault i would say the movie had  despite it s lack of a happy albeit peaceful ending  would be it s multiple languages  i had the unsubdued version  i m lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese  so i would recommend getting something with subtitles   all in all  the movie was just awesome
