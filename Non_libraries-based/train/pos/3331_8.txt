admittedly  i know nothing about baseball  i m not even a fan of the sport  but that didn t stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers  latest film  fever pitch  a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy  the film is not really about baseball  rather  it s really about relationships  and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place   jimmy fallen   giving his best performance to date   stars as ben  a dorky  lightly nerdy schoolteacher  ben is a kind of man boy  who unfortunately has never really grown up  and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team  ben has devoted his life to the sox  and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia   one day  while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office  ben meets the go getting lindsey  a wonderful drew barrymore  lindsey is a corporate  career orientated kind of girl  but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing  he s initially hesitant to ask her out  thinking that she s way out of his  class  and  lindsey doesn t immediately see a potential partner in ben   their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning   and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are  in fact  watching a farrelly brothers movie  rather than accept lindsey s   rather urgent   request to reschedule  ben sticks around to play nurse  orderly  and janitor  so ben scrubs the toilet and the dog s teeth  while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed   when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch  she begins the long  fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards  soon they are falling in love  with lindsey blithely accepting ben s fanatical devotion to his sport   having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle  ben has organized his life around the season   he s never missed a game  but their relationship  which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter  hits a snag at the start of the season   lindsey wants ben to do other things  like holiday with her parents and party with her friends  but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway  can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work  can she really accommodate ben s infatuation with sports  can a die hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all  of course  lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion wielding friends  lindsey s strictest buddy  the skinny  rich and blond robin  kadee strickland  insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he s still single at   however  plump  curly haired sarah  marissa jaret winokur  and molly  ione skye  supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben   ben s eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan  while lindsay s frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman  fallon is terrific as ben  exhibiting real big screen potential  overcoming the not insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic  barrymore  meanwhile  is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey  particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs   fever pitch really works  and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments  the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory   much of the movie was filmed at boston s fenway park  which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings  as well as the ambiance of the games  though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados  even so  fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect  mike leonard september
