i would imagine that if steve mcqueen knew he would go on to become an icon and start  wanted  dead of alive  the same year this film came out  or be in the magnificent seven two years later  he would not have done it  but he did  and we are the richer for it   sure it s a camp classic  horror the way it was meant to be for the drive in theater  it s fun and nostalgic   it is interesting that the last lines of the film were   lieutenant dave  at least we ve got it stopped  steve andrews  yeah  as long as the arctic stays cold    they never would have imagined   years ago that the arctic would be thawing  the blob will soon return
