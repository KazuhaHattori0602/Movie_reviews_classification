at the time i am writing this i see out of over   votes it has a   rating  something is wrong with that picture  personally i give it a   i can see a   at the lowest or a possible   if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is  it is a movie based on a comic book hero  this movie won more than it s share of awards  won   oscars  another   wins     nominations   right there tells me it s better than a   some great acting from some very good actors  some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come  if you re looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out dick tracy  definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times  al pacino is great as big boy caprice
