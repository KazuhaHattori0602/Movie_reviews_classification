i recently found a copy for   at a video store  and snapped it up eagerly  while the music and  obviously  graphics aren t up to the standards of my favorite of the series  beyond the mind s eye  i am still entranced by one segment   stanley and stella in  breaking the ice  the music is brilliant  and the emotions feel real  the clip on odyssey s website doesn t have the story nor the music  unfortunately
