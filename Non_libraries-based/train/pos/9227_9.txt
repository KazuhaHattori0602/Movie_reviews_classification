post feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism   spoiler alert    this underrated gem of a film tells the story of flavia  a fifteenth century girl of noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of medieval christian society by viewing a fallen islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure   unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent  explicitly stated in a scene where the bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks  flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and  through butting up against a whole system of subjugation  repression and violence  inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her   billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth  this is a film depiction the consequences of violence  the effects of patriarchal dominance  the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit   i described it in the title of this piece as  post feminist  and in the end flavia s triumphs must always be corrupted  compromised and perverted by men  even flavia s gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men  the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror   as to the much discussed violence  this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess  to have shied away from the violence would have limited the film s impact  would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the patriarchal discourse it is exposing  in addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society   beautifully filmed  brilliantly acted  notably by florinda bolkin and maria casares  containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years flavia is a classic of european cinema
