if you were a director that was looking to cast female victims for a slasher movie  then surely it would make sense to add a couple of porn stars  it s not as if they re inexperienced in front of the camera  they have no qualms with the requisite nudity and how many unattractive porn queens can you name  christian viel obviously recognized the potential of mixing hardcore actresses with hard gore effects and so he cast four of adult cinema s sexiest and most notorious stars  jenna jameson  chasey lain  ginger lynn allen and taylor hayes all turn up for cameos in arguably the most intriguing slasher flick to be released since scream reinvigorated the genre   samhain was originally intended for a cinema release in october     thus keeping in check with the halloween based synopsis  unfortunately  the shoot was plagued by numerous problems  which have thus prevented the feature from achieving the exposure that it deserves  last i heard it had been signed by film   here in the uk and was penned for a late october release direct to dvd  unfortunately that label has got a peerlessly abysmal track record with dtv slashers  not content with polluting our shelves with camp blood and its follow up  they were also responsible for unleashing granny  bleed and the rancid paranoid  could samhain finally be worthwhile ammunition to their contemptible catalogue cannon    five canadian american students and their teacher head to southern ireland as part of their history course  upon arrival they are told the legend of a cannibalistic clan that roamed the hills of scotland and murdered locals for food  the cannibals were eventually caught and burnt at the stake  but it s rumored that one of the tribe escaped and headed to the woodland of ireland to find refuge  after the kids have settled and begun doing what all massacre fodder does in these flicks  the mandatory goody two shoes  and definite heroine candidate  begins to be spooked by a shadow creeping around late at night  could it be that the flesh hungry maniac is still at large in the forest  well what do you think
    it looks as if samhain s production was jinxed right from the start  almost immediately wallmart refused to develop jenna jameson s nude make up shots  and chasey lain began acting characteristically like a drugged out primadonna  finally to add insult to injury  the producers got cold feet just before the flick was about to hit shelves and began talking of re editing and removing all the gore  reports have said that they were unhappy about the copious amounts of violence and they wanted to trim scenes down so it would achieve an r rating  veil of course disagreed  seeing how his entire synopsis was boosted by its creatively graphic display  eventually after months of arguments  the director parted company with warehouse productions and the feature was once again locked in the vaults   despite countless disruptions  veil s slasher opus is still one of the best genre pieces to be released since the new millennium  the copy i was sent was the pre release screener  which was obviously a test press without sound effects or the complete soundtrack  but still it boasted a few credible jump scares  some superb cinematography and a couple of the goriest set pieces that i ve seen for some time  one guy is disemboweled via his rectum before being strangled with his own intestine  jenna jameson is stripped naked and gutted in unflinching close up and chasey lain ends up  spilling her guts  after an unfortunate rescue attempt from her boyfriend  richard grieco  even though the murders are uncommonly gruesome  samhain never feels mean spirited  which is basically due to the characters being thinly portrayed as basic slasher clich s  in all honesty the script was perhaps the movies biggest downfall  because the dialogue was not so much inspired by wes craven s scream movies as it was flagrantly cut and pasted from them   certainly the inclusion of the mouth watering jenna jameson was a great move by the producers  her fans will be excited to know that she does whip off her top  as expected  and so does chasey lain and taylor hayes  but samhain is no soft porn movie  and it benefits from sticking to the structure that it set out to produce  it s worth noting that the aforementioned xxx stars almost out perform the supposed  actors  of the feature  which isn t much of a complement  ginger lynn was at least notable  if you ignore the shameful  oirish accent  and her battle with the hulking killer was superbly performed and choreographed by alan chou  taylor and jenna delivered expectedly poor dramatics  which could have been caused by the numerous problems on set  veil s direction of the cinematography was excellently constructed and he provides some much needed injections of suspense  exciting and crisp photography is mixed with a good flair for storytelling and the net result is a slasher extravaganza to satisfy even the most critical gore hounds   it will be interesting to see what kind of final cut is released of samhain  rumor has it that a second director was drafted in to shoot a different ending  and i m curious as to how much of the explicit gore will remain intact for worldwide distribution  if the end result is only half as good as the rough print that i watched  then it s still better than nearly all of the genre pieces that have been unleashed over the past ten years  this one is certainly worth checking out
