the tattooed stranger was another of those rare b movies that bbc  screened over christmas new year   see also they live by night and the brighton strangler   in this one  a man walking his dog in central park comes across an abandoned car and discovers a dead woman inside  she was shot and police then try to identify her with only a tattoo as the main clue  after being identified  the murderer is discovered and is shot in the shootout at the end   most of this movie was shot on location in and around new york  so we get to see some areas of the city we don t normally see  especially the back streets   mostly unknowns are in the cast  with john miles getting top billing   the tattooed stranger is worth seeking out  excellent but rather obscure   rating    stars out of
