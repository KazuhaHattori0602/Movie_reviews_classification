i saw this movie in   when i was   years old at a drive in theater with my family   way back then  i thought it was very funny       even though i was too young to understand   of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight  i saw it again this morning on  turner south  as i watched it  i was absolutely convulsed with laughter   the mating game  is a unique classic from a by gone age  if you re too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film  i feel very sorry for you  there s no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can  even today  deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to  old timers  like me   having said that  all i can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like  the mating game   movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people  and as such  these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand   in other words   if you don t understand the issues the film is addressing  please don t embarrass yourself by offering comments which   frankly   make no sense
