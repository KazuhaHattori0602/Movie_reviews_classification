i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer s art by presenting the beauty in man s deconstructing the natural landscape  it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations  setup shots  and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide  put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show   this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river  each sequence stands on its own  but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability  there are few words  this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way  an awful  massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories  individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e waste  the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards  the construction of the three gorges dam  the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time  the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was   the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control  the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees  demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters   the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries  the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully   by not saying what you should see 
 many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don t necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we re doing is creating problems that run deep  it is not a simple right or wrong  it needs a whole new way of thinking  the subtlety of this descends into an either or proposition  but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side   though never stated directly in any way  as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate  there is only one conclusion possible 
 we are doomed  the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in  what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise  unlike most films with environmental themes  this one ends with no call to arms  it argues basically what s the point  but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally
