a series of random  seemingly insignificant thefts at her sister s boarding house has miss lemon quite agitated  a ring  light bulbs  a rucksack  a lighter  a stethoscope  a shoe   there seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of it  miss lemon asks her employer  the great belgian detective hercule poirot  to look into the matter  but what poirot sees is something far more sinister than miss lemon could have imagined  and poirot s fears are confirmed when one of the students living in the boarding house if found murdered  it s up to poirot to bring a killer to justice   hickory dickory dock is a solid  but not spectacular  entry in the long running poirot series  i appreciate how faithful the script is to agatha christie s original story  i realize that certain liberties had to be taken  but i appreciate the effort nonetheless  the major points of the mystery are all there   the petty thefts  the boarding house  the students  the ripped rucksack  and  of course  poirot s ability to see something sinister going on before it actually happens  with a few exceptions  the cast of students is almost as i pictured them  damian lewis and jessica lloyd standout among the group  as mush as i always enjoy david suchet s poirot  i get a real kick out of the episodes with phillip jackson s inspector japp and pauline moran s miss lemon  this episode is a real treat as miss lemon gets more screen time than usual  finally  i enjoyed the use of the ever present mouse as an observer of the activities in the hostel  it s a fun little play on the hickory dickory dock title   i realized while re watching hickory dickory dock just what a tremendous influence agatha christie s work was on the highly stylized italian mystery films  or gialli  of the  s and  s  take the murder of mrs  nicoletis as an example  if you were to bump up the graphic nature of the scene  you would have something straight out of an early  s giallo  in fact  the entire plot of hickory dickory dock could have been used in a giallo  it s just convoluted and interesting enough to have worked
