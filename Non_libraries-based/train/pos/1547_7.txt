like almost everyone else who has commented on this movie  i can only wonder why this has never appeared on video   i recall seeing it at about age   on the  the late show  circa   i too recall the poison gas attack and the weirdly garbed horses   i don t recall the more horrific bits i ve seen described here  they were likely cut out for the tv audience  but the scenes i really liked were the ones involving the death of lord kitchener aboard the hms hampshire  almost exactly   years ago  the scenes of the doomed cruiser approaching the minefield in the storm were really chilling  as i recall   don t recall the musical score  but the comments of the others now have me curious  get this one out on video
