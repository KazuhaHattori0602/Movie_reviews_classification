  and the series lets you forget all that  i am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series  born in   i learned to drive during the first gas shortage  and got my first post college graduation job during the second gas shortage in   the  s were a truly dreadful time to be young   inflation  competing for after school minimum wage jobs with laid off thirty somethings  dreadful music  worse clothes   the funny thing is  this series doesn t ignore any of that and still manages to make the  s look fun  even for those of us old enough to know better  it manages to look the  s directly in the face   complete with time authentic clothing   and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times  then there are the parents  the two young lovers in the show   eric forman and donna pinciotti   truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions  eric s parents  red and kitty  are not exactly june and ward although they are conventional for the decade  they represent what happened when the  s finally reached the suburbs during the  s  donna s parents are two people who have been waiting for the  s to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy  eric s friends fez  kelso  and jackie round out the group representing nerdiness  well meaning incompetence  and snobbishness respectively  hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs  but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents  i highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of eric
