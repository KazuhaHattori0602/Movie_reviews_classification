a year after losing gorgeous jane parker  maureen o sullivan  to love rival tarzan  hunter harry holt  neil hamilton  returns to the jungle to have another bash at winning the brunette babe s heart  mixing business with pleasure  he also plans to grab himself some ivory from the elephant graveyard that lies beyond the mutia escarpment  tarzan s stomping ground   accompanied by his slimy  womanising pal martin arlington and a group of expendable bearers  harry finally arrives at his destination  having narrowly avoided death at the hands of savage natives and rock hurling apes  only to find that jane is still infatuated with her musclebound yodeller  and worse still  that tarzan is refusing to let the hunters take any ivory from the graveyard   nasty arlington decides to resolve matters by ambushing and shooting the ape man and then telling jane and holt that tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile  of course  tarzan isn t dead only wounded  after being nursed back to health by cheetah   he swings back into action just in time to rescue jane from a tribe of vicious lion eating savages who have attacked holt s expedition   tarzan and his mate  the second movie to star weismuller as the jungle man of few words  is often cited by fans as the best of the series  although i slightly prefer the original  i can definitely understand the film s popularity  it s damn sexy and there are some great action sequences  the undeniable chemistry between weismuller and o sullivan is fabulous and leads to some pretty steamy scenes  and with both stars wearing eensy weensy outfits throughout  there s eye candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes to enjoy  despite o sullivan s much touted underwater nude scene actually being performed by a body double  the lovely lass still shows plenty of skin  even threatening to do a  sharon stone  at one point as her loin cloth flaps to one side   the film s most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater fight between tarzan and a crocodile  and the spectacular final  where jane is attacked by lions and natives  but is rescued by her beau  his monkey pals  and a load of elephants in full on lion crushing mode  once again  the violence is surprisingly nasty at times  although as far as i am concerned  there is nothing quite as shocking as the vicious pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first film  cheetah also has his fair share of excitement  dodging rhinos  crocs  and big cats  riding on tarzan s back as he crosses a river  and even hopping onto an ostrich for a ride   like it s predecessor  tarzan and his mate does suffer slightly from some bad effects and unconvincing props dodgy back projection  a few laughable monkey suits  more indian elephants masquerading as their african cousins  and poorly disguised trapeze swings but these shouldn t spoil your enjoyment of this very entertaining film  if anything  they make it even more fun     out of   rounded up to   for imdb
