the movie i thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between   rob stewart is a wonderful actor i don t know why people keep giving him a bad rap  as for mel harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for rob it s only by five years   rob had a lead role in his own tv series as well as one on the scifi channel  i m sure you remember topical heat aka sweating bullets and painkiller jane   he also starred in a number of tv movies and is now making a tv mini series   they need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
