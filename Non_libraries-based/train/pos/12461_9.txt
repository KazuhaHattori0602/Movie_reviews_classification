a clever script from the late sebastian japrisot and smart performances from the two male leads   alain delon and charles bronson  or should it be the other way around  result in an engaging and entertaining thriller   add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by francois de roubaix  it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality   this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners  both disillusioned and world weary  returning  presumably from algiers  like the other colonial powers of this time  post ww ii leading into the  s  france had struggled to keep up appearances overseas  losing algiers was a bitter blow   adieu l ami  the original title  chronicles the actions of our two  anti  heroes as they struggle to make a go of it  after their discharge   one thing happens after another  and the viewer really has to pay attention  because japrisot is lean and economical with his script  if it is there  then there must be a reason   suffice to say  these two men battle it out  physically and psychologically  one long weekend  their motivation is quite different  their goals are different   their survival depends entirely on each other  that alain delon and charles bronson are outwardly so different   the former  arguably a pretty boy  and the latter an ugly thug  adds to the chemistry   that quest makes for a great story  which in turn  makes for a great film   lest i forget there are women in this film  and true to the japrisot method  they too are memorable  though not nearly as fleshed out  to say much more would be to spoil one s delight in discovering their true nature   farewell  friend has been released in the uk  an anamorphic image    enhanced  in english only  not even subtitles for the hard of hearing  a running time of   minutes  mono soundtrack but the de roubaix music has lots of punch    highly recommended
