the film did not do well at the box office   i saw it in a sneak preview   i have always enjoyed the film   i live in   of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to   not the best film ever put to screen  but enjoyable   robin did well with his role   best line of the film at the beginning  by robin s character jack   i was that sob  cleaned up here as not to offend anyone   was glad when it came to dvd a few years back in the wide screen letter box format   i am not a football fan or a real sports fan  but  you do not need to be one to like this film
