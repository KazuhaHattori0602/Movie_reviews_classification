four words account for why this film was made    she done him wrong  the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay  s melodramas were a viable proposition  here we are rewarded with a fast moving  well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars   wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals  jackie cooper is a little harder to take  but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock in trade damsel in distress  with a strong director   as walsh proves himself to be   wray could carry a lot of punch  and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery s affection   lots of atmosphere  beautifully designed  this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
