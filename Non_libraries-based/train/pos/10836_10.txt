i thought this movie was fantastic  it was hilarious  kinda reminded me of spinal tap  this is a must see for any fan of  s rock   i hope me and my friends aren t like that in twenty years   bill nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit   stephen rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together  but not succeeding well   if you love music  and were ever in a band  this movie is definitely for you  you won t regret seeing this movie  i know i don t  even my family found it funny  and that s saying something
