i saw this jolly little film at age   in   when it was broadcast on cbs  i didn t know it had been in a theater at all  to rate it from a kids point of view i d give it   out of   stars because being a young boy at the time it seemed a little  girlish   the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing    when i re discovered it a blockbuster video in  i had to revisit it  i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit  old  i don t know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn t on vhs   it s out there  might even be on dvd by now at least i hope it is  i want to share it with my kids someday    stars on here it s still a great kids film   end       finally found a vhs copy  woo hoo
