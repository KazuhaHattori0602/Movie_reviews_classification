i own ralph bakshis forgotten masterpiece fire   ice on an old oop rental videotape    well for one thing  this is better than any other conan esque film you ll ever see  sure  it s cheesy  but who cares  it stood the test of time  and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like lotr fotr  though i love that film    the plot goes like this  after a battle between fire   ice  a kings daughter is kidnapped by jarols  ice  subhuman creatures  while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her    yeah it doesn t sound as a original as nurse betty  but that s not the point  it is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies  fire   ice  and it succeeds    as for the action scenes  superb  they are well handled  have terrific suspence  and have plenty of loud noises  just check out the climatic battle  now that s an ending    the acting and dialogue  competent  really  they aren t gonna be nominated for an oscar  but they are ok and don t get on your nerves    the animation is quite good  shot on  d and rotoscoped  i think  it looks pretty good  a lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn  and although the character designs feel a little  dimentional  they are ok    overall  this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical  entertainment
