in loving memory of david tomlinson    when i watched this movie for the first time i was   years old and i got fascinated by this story of witches in the  nd world war  the scene  which impressed me the most  was the fight between the nazi soldiers and the medieval army  it was exceptional to see this army without a body walk to fight the astonished singing their march  this movie is fantastic  from the trip to portobello road  which became to me the most fantastic place of london  to the journey to naboomboo  angela lansbury and david tomlinson are really a fantastic couple  she is always great  it seems the good aunt of a family and david with his always astonished face is her great co protagonist  we ll miss him a lot
