having first watched the movie at   i remember being struck by hearing the word  govno   sh t  for the first time ever on the then still soviet tv  i bet it really was  the  first time in history   anyone wants to add this to trivia section  what an open boldness and freedom  i thought  as years passed  i was more and more impressed with the movie and the incredible acting  but my feelings turned to a kind of mixture of enjoyment from a genuine piece of cinematographic art and a bitter realization of a concept diametrically opposite to my  y o  impression  helplessness  there s an air of inevitable catastrophe looming throughout the movie  of primitive degenerate tide  embodied by sharikov  sweeping the lives of the finest minds advancing humanity in their areas  it s a great metaphor of russian revolution in general  inspired by intellectuals ashamed of their superiority and hoping to  upgrade  the lower classes  only to unleash the power of mediocrity and get swallowed by it  an extremely fine and talented piece  wrapping a truly sad idea in a brilliantly satiric and elegant form  symbolically enough  the movie itself marked the end of the soviet movie traditions era before the hollywood tsunami had knocked them over   for good  it seems  judging by most current russian movies  most of them labeled  blockbusters  in prerelease  trailers and posters   funnily  that  govno  episode is in no contradiction to efenstor s comment above re rude language of current generation  from what i ve already said it could seem that this might be the movie that showed the way for this  but it was not  a mild word by current standards  it was way too rude back then  and just rude enough to show the true nature of all sharikovs  btw  re efenstor s lament  it is sooo naive to juxtapose being intellectual and using rude lexicon  especially for russian speakers  where a single cussword could have meanings that take sentences in translation  but i join in regret that all the meaning in today s teenager s talk may be expressed by cusswords  i feel that this is the bigger problem than their choice of the medium that s most efficient for the task  well  this movie and the book are great food for thought that might change them  or anyone who might have a luxury of watching it
