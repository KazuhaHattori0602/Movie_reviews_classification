it is a superb swedish film   it was the first swedish film i ve seen   it is simple   deep   what a great combination   michael nyqvist did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown   frida hallgren was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on   never give up   the fight between the conductor and the hypocrite priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and defends michael s noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music   the only thing that i didn t like was the ending   it wasn t that good but it has some deep meaning
