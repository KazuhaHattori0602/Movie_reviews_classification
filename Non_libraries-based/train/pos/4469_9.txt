usually musicals in the  s were of a set formula   and if you studied films you know what i m talking about   a certain running lenghth  very  showy  performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc   this one is different   and light years better and well worth it s nomination for best picture of the year      although had no chance of beating the eventual winner   lost weekend   gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career   yes i know about  american in paris  and  singing in the rain  this one is different  he really gets into his character of a  sea wolf  thinking  at first  that  picking up any girl while on leave  is nothing more than a lark  and if you had to make up a  story  to get her   so be it   until  sort of like the music man when he gets  his foot caught in the door  the eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal  sinatra s attempt to make the  story  good in order to  get the girl  that he really and unexpectedly falls in love with  you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean   besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one  it s a classic buddy story  nostalgia to a time when wwii was almost over  the war ended about a month after the films release  a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being  great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that i can t think of right now   why not a   near the end   at nearly     hours starts to feel a bit long  there is a small ballet number that gene kelly does that must have been a sensation in   but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now  but overall  this ones a definite winner on every level
