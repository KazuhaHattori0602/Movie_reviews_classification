second part  actually episode   of the hit danish tv series is slightly inferior to the first one  but has plenty of laughs and scares as well  this time  udo kier plays two parts  as the monster baby and his demon like father  other standout parts this time are s ren pilmark s doctor krogshoj  who must face the horrible revenge of dr  helmer  and once again  patient mrs  drusse tries to solve the mysteries  miss marple style  ends on a cliffhanger and following the deaths of lead actors ernst hugo j reg rd  dr  helmer  and kirsten rolffes  mrs  drusse  you wonder how they re ever going to be able making part iii  but i hope von trier will give it a shot  sadly  morten rotne leffers  the down s syndrome dishwasher   died shortly after  as well  look for stellan skarsg rd in a cameo
