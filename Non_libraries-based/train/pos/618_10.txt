this movie is wonderful   i was  enchanted  i should say  and surprised because of how uniquely it was done  the cast  the sequencing  the effects everything  magnificent  i mean  it was a love story  yes  but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining  wholesome manner   for me  it is the representation of modern fairy tale  it s like the modern peter pan simply amazing  i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market   this movie is really a double must see one    stars for that
