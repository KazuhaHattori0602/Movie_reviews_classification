this is a film which had eluded me thus far but  now that i ve watched it  emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style  as usual with the divx format  the viewing was far from ideal   marred by the occasional video and  mostly  audio glitches   but  given that the film is still unavailable on r  dvd  this will have to do for the moment  since the film s reputation is quite high within the genre itself  i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well known actor in the lead   anyway  the belated entrance of the film s nominal star   franchot tone   packs quite a wallop  especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first  tone was a underrated actor   he was rarely given meaty roles  and this may well be his best  making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous  the female lead   ella raines  who would later feature in brute force   as well as siodmak s own the suspect   and the strange affair of uncle harry     is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss  alan baxter  innocent of his wife s brutal murder  other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator  and elisha cook jr    the genre s quintessential fall guy   as an ill fated  ladies  man  of a percussionist   like brute force s jules dassin  siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction   all tilted angles and terrific set pieces  including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly attired raines  who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail  another great  lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender  another uncooperative witness  around the streets of new york   which results in his being mowed down by a car    notable  too  is the trial sequence   which is entirely depicted through the audience s reaction so that judge  jury  witnesses and d a  are never actually seen  although the judge s voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s  hinds  the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved  with the inspector s put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone  dizzy spells  the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment  where she discovers evidence of his guilt   and he confesses to having had an affair with baxter s wife  but killed her when she wouldn t desert her husband for him   by the way  i hit upon a little goof in the film  while the story is clearly set in   i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film   in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater   the establishing shot of new york  comprising clearly of stock footage  features a marquee promoting laurel and hardy s   musical comedy  swiss miss  incidentally  famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym
