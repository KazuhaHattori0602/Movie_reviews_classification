soylent green i found to be an excellent movie   if you like logan s run you ll like this   yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as  cheesy  but the story is excellent   the story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant   at the end the mystery wasn t a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace   it s nearest modern day equivalent would be  dark angel  in terms of how the us is shown to be third world country
