like tarzan the ape man   only more so  there s more of everything  more animals  more varied african tribes  and scenes in which the thought must be  if this was good with three or four lions  forty would be better  tarzan wrestles with crocodiles the the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin  around and around  jaws flapping  tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still  tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals  his friends are real chimps  people wearing larger ape costumes  and elephants  in fact  they use indian elephants far more friendly and trainable than african ones with costume ears attached to their heads  the human story  another white man  worse than the rest  shows up to join with holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard  tarzan won t show them the way  so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed  tarzan intercedes  and the bad guy shoots him but  of course  he survives and returns to save jane  everybody else dies  holt and the bad guy and every single one of their  boys  people are expendable  especially africans  and there doesn t seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them  this must be the last tarzan movie before the hays code made jane wear more clothes  there are a number of underwater scenes in which jane swims nude  and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing  apparently one of weismuller s friends from the olympic swim team did the nude scenes  and not maureen o sullivan  she  however  moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth weismuller wears  plus a bikini top  showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip  they still don t need to talk a lot  they sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities  no wonder they re happy
