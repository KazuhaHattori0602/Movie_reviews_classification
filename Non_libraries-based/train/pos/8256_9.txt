saw this movie at the vancouver film festival and thought it was deadly smart  stylish  and funny   the cast was rock solid  great work by carrie anne moss  dylan baker  tim blake nelson  billy connelly and up and comer  alexia fast   weirdly  i found myself thinking about the movie for days after seeing it   writers  dennis heaton  robert chomiak and andrew currie layered in a lot of political subtext   but didn t whack you over the head with it   the world they created had depth  and made sense  there is a giddy carnivorous spirit to this movie   fido is guaranteed to cure grumpiness   loved it
