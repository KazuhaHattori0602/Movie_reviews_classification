the story is somewhat stilted  what with the main character s sudden reversals of fortune  but leslie howard and bette davis s portrayals of philip carey  the na ve obsessed lover and mildred rogers  the unworthy object of his affections  raise this film considerably above standard melodrama   sensitive  cultured philip  who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years later ashley wilkes  the southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough reconstruction era  philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before mildred enters the picture he doesn t even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he ll never make it as a painter  it is perhaps this passivity  these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he does   although leslie howard is memorable  today  of human bondage  is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture  perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred  and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy  mildred may have a grating voice  but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel  making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did  although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional  she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her  one may also think she is on to something when she accuses philip of looking down on her for not being  fine  enough   the scene in which philip and norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this   most of the supporting characters are also effective  particularly norah the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has mildred s beauty and norah s decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end  the only character i found hollow was sally s eccentric  ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era   a classic that deserves it reputation
