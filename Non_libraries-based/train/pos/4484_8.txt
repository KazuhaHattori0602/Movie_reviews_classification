released some months before the end of the war   anchors aweigh  is one of gene kelly s major musical triumphs of the forties
   under the direction of george sidney  it had the benefits of a pleasant score  and best of all the services of gene kelly in his first true starring role at mgm
 the year before  in columbia s  cover girl  he had revealed an innovative approach to dance on the screen  a light but agreeable singing voice  and considerable charm in  anchors aweigh  although he was billed under frank sinatra and kathryn grayson  he was laying the solid groundwork for his most revealing years at mgm
   the film s story  a kind of dry run for  on the town  four years later  follows sailors kelly and sinatra on shore leave  spend their holiday in hollywood  where they become involved in the affairs of an aspiring singer  grayson  and her little nephew  dean stockwell   grayson  it appears  has her heart set on an audition with conductor pianist jose iturbi
 she gets the audition  of course  kelly gets grayson after some misunderstandings  and sinatra  has forgotten to be shy  and has lost his heart to a girl from brooklyn  pamela britton   the plot is conventional for the period but  regrettably  it now seems barely tolerable
 but there is gene kelly  who dominates the movie with his agreeable personality
 perhaps he grins too much  but when is permitted to dance  the film finally lifts off the ground
    i begged her  his early song and dance with sinatra  is amusing and slightly absurd  in which he imagines himself as a bandit chieftain in a spanish courtyard  courting maiden grayson with a flamboyant flamenco dance and some athletic leaps
 he also does a charming mexican dance with little sharon mcmanus in the square of a mexican settlement in los angeles
  the highlight of the movie  however  is kelly s famous dance with the cartoon character jerry the mouse  of  tom and jerry  fame  delightful and innovative  it skillfully combines live action and animation in its tale of a sad mouse king who refuses to allow music in his kingdom until kelly  a sailor in the  pomeranian navy  wearing a striped shirt and a beret  shows him how to dance
  look at me  i m dancin  says the gleeful mouse king
