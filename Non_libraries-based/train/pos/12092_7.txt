i first remember seeing this one back in the  s when it was shown on late night television  scared the hell out of me  but then  i was a teenager back in those days  not as jaded about films as i am now   castle of blood  aka  danse macabre  is a fine example of the  s italian horror genre  along with mario bava s black sunday  curse of the living dead  aka  kill baby kill    and mario caiano s nightmare castle   if you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing  then check these out as well  i also rate these along with those early poe films that roger corman was doing during the same period   i saw the new synapse dvd that was taken from a french print and it s a great improvement over that old pan and scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years  it adds a couple of minutes of dialog  in french  that don t really add much to the movie as whole  but it s nice to see it complete  without cuts  unfortunately the dvd doesn t really offer any extras beyond stills from the film   one flub i noticed was in the opening scene  seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn s front door  i guess the editors didn t catch it at the time  or maybe they didn t care  but it is something i didn t notice the first time  that s the wonders of dvd  you get to see all the flubs  mistakes and details that weren t apparent the first time around  but no matter   but no matter  it still gets a   on the imdb meter
