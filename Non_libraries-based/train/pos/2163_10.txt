i simply love this movie  it is a perfect example of the well rounded surprising stories that come out of asian cinema  there was a recent hollywood remake of this movie  with richard gere and the simply awful jennifer lopez  please do not confuse the two movies  the original japanese film is touching  subtle and wonderfully acted  the hollywood version is the exact opposite  i was aghast when i first saw the trailer for the remade us version and who was starring in it  it s typical hollywood unoriginal crass commercialism at it s worst  the remake cements the argument that some foreign films can never be improved upon  the only reason the original film did not become more widely viewed is the us audience s aversion to subtitles   one of the main reasons this movie would never work in an american telling is that the reserved  ultra socially conservative character of the public japanese persona is at issue in this movie  certainly the main character awakens to a more full understanding of living a vivacious life through dance  but half of the movie s tension comes from the stereotypes and ridicule ballroom dancers face in japan   please try to see this movie in it s original form  not the terrible full screen  and please do skip the us remake it s a shallow travesty in comparison to the original japanese movie   yes  i know the  original  movie is much older  and this is simply a japanese take on the story  but the only two people are likely to see any time soon are this one and the new us remake   speaking of foreign films  i ll make a few quick recommendations   monsoon wedding i list this first for a reason  outstanding film   johnny stechino very funny italian mistaken identity flic   shiri a korean action pic that mixes both asian flare   us style plot  run lola run a german film that integrates it s techno score ingeniously   well  just a quick list anyway
