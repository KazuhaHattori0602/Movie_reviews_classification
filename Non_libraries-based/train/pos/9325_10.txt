i have found this movie available for streaming on netflix and thought i d give it a try   the plot revolves around ryan and theo taylor  colm feore and david cubitt  who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away  ryan and theo at first argue about who did what  but later  theo finds out that his brother ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness  so  ryan and theo spend their time patching up their differences   this is such an incredible film  i have only seen colm feore in season   of   but he was phenomenal in this  david cubitt  an actor i have never heard of before did a phenomenal job as well   i would recommend this to those who are interested in the gay and lesbian genre  this is one movie you don t want to miss   i give this film   stars out of   excellent film
