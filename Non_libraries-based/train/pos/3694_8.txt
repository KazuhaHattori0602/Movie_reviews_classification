wasn t sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn t disappoint   for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent  which made me feel better about mine  which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie   the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award  the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope   however  the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical  the dialogue in wes craven s section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible   on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish  it s not too painful to sit through the bad sections   they only last   minutes anyway   ca vaut la peine
