rented this one accidentally  it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting  didn t find out until i got home  watched it anyways  absolutely fantastic  a wonderful movie  and one of my top three favorite of all time  i recommend it to everyone   the story is enjoyable and easy to follow  this could have been easily messed up  but the actors and director do a great job of keeping it together   the actors themselves are fantastic  displaying wonderful character and doing a terrific job    gotta find a copy somewhere
