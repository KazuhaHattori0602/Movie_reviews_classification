not sure one can call this an anti war film  it shows war at an elite level  these are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it  even when they are pacifist  they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes  even if it does go against being a pacifist  the movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go more so by todays standards  no body parts flying off as in modern movies  it is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level  this is more of a thinking man s movie  once you start to watch you don t want to miss anything  the thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions  is what the movie is about  not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline  this maybe called a war triller   if you are into the skill of war  if you are into reading or seeing programs about the sas and so on  you want to watch this movie   comparable movies are the hill   with sean connery   th parallel   with an all star cast  the naked and the dead   with cliff robertson  all are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level  enjoy
