moonwalker is probably not the film to watch if you re not a michael jackson fan  i m a big fan and enjoyed the majority of the film  the ending wasn t fantastic but the first   or so minutes were   if you re a fan   i personally believe the first   minutes are re watchable many times over  the dancing in each video is breathtaking  the music fantastic to listen to and the dialogue entertaining   it includes many of his finest videos from bad and snippets from his earlier videos  it also includes some live concert footage   if you re a big fan of michael jackson this is a must  if you re not a fan don t like michael jackson  steer well clear
