there is one detail  which is not very common for jackie chan movies  but which is present here  it has some very tough and serious atmosphere about it while the funny elements are present too  jackie is menacing and psychotic here  he is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back  in a usual laid back pattern  but he is the one who can go and start the tumult  his manner of hitting that evil guy in the glasses is amazing  every time it goes  crack  i also especially enjoy the scene when jackie goes to the pub and thrashes the villains who had fronted on his girlfriend  it s one of the best blitzkriegs put on screen  besides  the whole scene is shot with the background of some action character painted on the wall  it also looks like a poster of  rabochiy  from our soviet era  and some lines in russian on the left  i noticed that quite accidentally  that looks terrific  and nostalgic for russian people  i also like when the windows are being smashed in the movies  here there s a lot of this stuff  it s quite amazing watching the characters falling jumping running driving through all manner of panes   all three movies are great  i had been preparing myself to see the down slide of the quality but i saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts  and not only jackie chan s character appears in all three movies   that s also excellent and keeps continuity up   i would like to describe each movie just in a few words  no    great  in all aspects   it is one gripping story from the very beginning to the very end  and funny  many scenes are ridiculous  no    raging  jackie is really  beep  off here  and painful  jackie gets tortured  no    unbelievable  the woman that fights alongside with jackie is incredible  and bombastic  should i mention a lot of guns and explosions   as to the rest   much has been mentioned by the others   it s a trilogy that can be watched over and over again  at least by me  its place is in top   among action comedy jewels  finally it s been released in russia on dvd  the  nd film has the best options   the chinese russian soundtracks and english russian subtitles   solid   out of   thank you for attention
