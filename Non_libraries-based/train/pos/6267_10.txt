i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out   since i had already seen the original  when i saw this on sci fi channel  i don t know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi   i knew what it was within the first few minutes  since i like richard burgi as a character actor  i wanted to see how he would pull it off   the writers producers etc  modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the  aliens   they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help  using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the  s  maybe it added a bit of polish to the film  or not   this film  film  this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did  the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place  although no resolution of the alien s problem   i sort of remember that in this remake  the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi alien  i think it could have ended better  but the ending is just the ending  and the yarn is a swell yarn  being of the basic   science fiction pulp stock  many great science fiction stories were written in the  s and some of them even made it to film   this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something  i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old  s sci fi  this one came off well  i actually enjoyed this quite a bit   but if anyone really wants to see this story told well  i suggest the original   version with tom tyron and gloria talbott  directed by gene fowler jr
