got to this show late   believe it was the  rd  and final episode  when first watched it   and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn t been seen on american tv since  all in the family   was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place   which is merely to say the last time cbs  had a set    if you know what i mean   was back in the day of  all in the family  the most controversial decision they re willing to tackle today is how much eye make up to put on katie couric   if you want to make a bunch of folks really  really mad   let them discover the truth about themselves  and if you want them willing to pull strings  make calls  and get a work of art removed   let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths   the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve  and this show is no different  somehow it snuck under the cbs  corporate social political censor radar  to get it onto the schedule  perhaps the  big brass  never really watched it till it finally aired  but once good  ol middle  merika heard and saw themselves being themselves   well  can bet the farm that message  or the messenger  won t last long   now  if only the  missing episodes  can find their way onto usenet or bit torrent    thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla
