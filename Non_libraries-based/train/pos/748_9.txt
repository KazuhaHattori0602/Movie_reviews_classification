this is   and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had   years ago  it connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered   clothes and music might have changed over time  but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up to dateness  and especially this movie does the job pretty well  of course it is cheesy at times  but very touching as well   jodie foster s performance is striking  and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies   don t miss this one
