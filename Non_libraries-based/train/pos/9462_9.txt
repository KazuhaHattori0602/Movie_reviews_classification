clean family oriented movie  i laughed  i cried i loved it  i was worried i wouldn t be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office  boy  was i wrong  he should win an oscar for his performance  i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out  my husband enjoyed it and he isn t into movies of this  type  i saw it with   other couples in the   year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest  only   cuss word  not even sure why it was pg  i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy  drama  romance and more
