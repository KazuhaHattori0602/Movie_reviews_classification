okay  so robbie s a little hokey looking by today s standards  and some of the acting is pretty stilted  and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright   year old kid with a decent computer editing program  and don t get me started about the poster   this is still a great movie    years after it was released  i grew up watching  science fiction  on the local tv station s  science fiction adventure theater  on sunday afternoons  so i ve seen quite a few sf movies from the  s  at a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city  forbidden planet forever raised the bar and showed that it was possible to make a science fiction movie which actually had a plot   i doubt that many sf movies made in the  s will still be considered worth watching in
