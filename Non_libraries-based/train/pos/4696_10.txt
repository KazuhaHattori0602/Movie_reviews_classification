even though this movie is quite old  no matter how many times i watch it  it still makes me laugh    one particular quote in the movie stands out    when danny  joe piscopo  pulls up to the d a s office   parks in a disabled spot  danny s partner says     can t park here  it s for the handicapped    danny replies   i am handicapped i m psychotic   that is one of the many lines in the movie that no matter how many times you watch  it ll make you chuckle   johnny dangerously stands in my top   comedy spoof movies of all time   as an added bonus it also includes the legendary actor peter boyle in the cast  so watch this movie   like myself   many others who have watched it  you ll be hooked
