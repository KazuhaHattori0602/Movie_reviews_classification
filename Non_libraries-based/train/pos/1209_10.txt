in an era of such awful cartoons  i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies   this movie does contradict the first  i won t deny that  however  when i was in the target age group for this movie  i didn t even notice  nor would it have mattered if i did  the people who made it may have used  new generation  to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began  perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began   this was my favorite movie at age   and it did not scare me or confuse me at all
