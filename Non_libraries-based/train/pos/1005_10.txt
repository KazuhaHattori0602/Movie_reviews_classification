verhoeven s movie was utter and complete garbage  he s a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed  by his own admission  he read   chapters of the book  got bored  and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch   heinlein would have never supported that trash if he d been alive to see it  it basically steals the name  mocks politics of the book  which is a good portion of it  and throws in some t a so the average idiot american moviegoer doesn t get bored   this anime isn t perfect  but it s at least mostly accurate  as best i can tell
