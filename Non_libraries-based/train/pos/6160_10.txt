spoiler alert   i had just watched the extended version of bedknobs and broomsticks  though i did like the extended version  i wish they would have left the original version on the dvd   the portabello road could have been cut down to the orginal length  it was too long and dragged the movie along  though the dancing is great  would have been much better left on the dvd as a deleted scene   all in all this is a great movie  my   year old liked it  and it is wonderful that movies that i enjoyed as a child are being passed on to a new generation  this and mary poppins are added to my collection   just as i had remembered     out of
