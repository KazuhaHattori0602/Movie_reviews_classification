i haven t seen this in over  yrs but i still remember things about it   this film could not have been made in color  the stark grays are what make it  and was life really that simple in the  s  what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows  his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap  i don t think i could watch that again once is plenty  it s like that unnamed guy at the beginning of  papillon  who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine  the guy that said watch this on a double bill with  dead man walking  should have added the last   minutes of  i want to live  as well   some of my ancestors being  aristos  went to the guillotine in   so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
