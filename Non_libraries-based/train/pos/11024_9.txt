this movie is just great  it s entertaining from beginning to the end  you re always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie  in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics   sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy gabe walker  together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker  and then  john lithgow  one of the best performances i ve seen of him as a villain   and the fact that   of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action    brilliant movie
