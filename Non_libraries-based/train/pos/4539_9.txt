the acting is pretty cheesy  but for the people in this area up in the  s and are now detroit area automotive engineers  this is a great movie  i even work with a japanese supplier so that makes this movie even more funny   jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show  he looks pretty young here  years ago  the opening scene  with the drag race on what appears to be woodward ave was great   leno also owns some bad a  cars now  it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection  i m sure the blown vette in the opening scene was his own car   typical  s movie  watch it and enjoy  no computer generated crap
