for me too  this christmas special is one that i remember very fondly  in   i snatched up the   cds i found of the soundtrack recording  giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself  it s part of my family s christmas tradition now  and i would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as i listen   it has been noted elsewhere that john denver made a number of appearances on the muppet show  and they did more than one special together  the good rapport between denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here  in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages
