what do you get if you cross the matrix with the truman show   i m sure you ve all seen the matrix by now  the creators of the matrix say that it is  anime inspired  just from watching the trailer to this classic  you can see where they took the plot from   the film is sort of set in  s japan  and it really shows  the costumes  music and words in the recent english language version by ad vision  are all like they ve been directly lifted from the era  i believe it was made in that time also  but due to certain plot points  this doesn t date the film   as you probably guessed by my referencing to the matrix  the world isn t real  it s not really the  s  in fact  it s something more like the  s  after a nuclear war  the earth or  biosphere prime s ecosystem was destroyed  the survivors we re forced to escape into space  where the conflict continued  once the planets or  biospheres  were all abandoned  people began to live in megazones   cities inside of spaceships  where  via hypnotism techniques and truman show esque illusion  they were made to believe they we re back on earth  in the most peaceful time in recent memory  the  s  when young shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle  it leads him to find out more than he s supposed to know  the garland a bike which becomes a mech  a weapon from the  s  aids shogo in his escape from the pursuing military  as more and more is discovered about the megazone  the war comes closer to home  and due to conflicts between the military and the computer  the war comes to the megazone too  i apologise if those points are seen as spoilers  but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis   emotions run high in this movie  moreso than the matrix  you really do believe the war is going on  and shogo really does become quite scarred by what he s discovering  what starts off as an uber happy cool  s flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality  these characters are real people  not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet time in the matrix  there really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy  and a war  it may just choke you up towards the end  i know it did me   animation is pretty impressive for it s day  and the picture quality on the advision dvd is unbelievable for it s age  the artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime  very cultural  be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood  there s also an erotic sex scene   the ending can be seen as a  there can be no ending  similar to the matrix  or  supposedly can be followed by the sequel  which i haven t yet had the pleasure of watching   i have to say that this is one of the best animes i ve seen  in fact  one of the best movies i ve seen  and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time   i must recommend the advision dvd  as their take on the english language is incredible  and does the movie justice  and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released  which will have the same vocal cast   all in all  megazone   is an incredible movie  and deserves to be held highly  and should be an essential in any anime fan s collection  heck  even my mother enjoyed it
