 wisecracker  the biography of actor william haines  offers a gratifying anecdote about the former star when he was past   and long retired from making movies  the old gent was not sentimental and rarely watched his own films  but in   he was persuaded to attend a los angeles museum screening of show people  the late silent feature in which he co starred with marion davies  beforehand  haines was worried that this comedy would provoke the wrong kind of laughter  but he was pleasantly surprised  and no doubt relieved  at how well it held up and how much the young audience enjoyed it  watch the film today and you can see why  show people is a delightful hollywood satire that retains its charm because it lampoons its targets with wit and flair  yet without malice  it s still funny and its satirical points still resonate  needless to say  the technology of movie making has changed vastly since the silent days  but the pretensions and follies of the filmmakers themselves haven t changed all that much   show people also stands as the best surviving work of marion davies  a first rate comic performer who deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of great comediennes  where her career was concerned davies was both blessed and cursed by the patronage of her paramour  the newspaper magnate william randolph hearst  it s well known that hearst exerted enormous influence over davies  choice of roles  and well known too that  despite her gift for comedy  he preferred to see her play dignified heroines in period costume dramas  by the late  s  for whatever reason  marion was permitted to strut her stuff in several exuberant light comedies  including the red mill and the patsy  but show people  directed by the great king vidor  stands as her most enjoyable showcase  william haines gives an engaging  likable performance as her boyfriend and co star billy boone  but this is the leading lady s show all the way   marion plays southern belle peggy pepper  an aspiring actress who storms hollywood accompanied by her father  determined to become a movie star   her dad colonel pepper is played by actor director dell henderson  a veteran of griffith s biograph dramas who coincidentally resembled hearst  one of marion s funniest bits  often excerpted elsewhere  is her audition at the comet studio casting office  while dad helpfully suggests emotions to portray  sorrow        joy  and drops a handkerchief across her face  peggy assumes the appropriate expression and posture  she s hired  only to discover that comet makes low brow comedies  the kind of comedies where people squirt each other with seltzer and inept cops tumble over each other racing to the rescue  of course  comet is intended as a take off of mack sennett s keystone  but the true nature of the satire becomes clear as the story unfolds  as peggy pepper rises in the movie star hierarchy she leaves comet for the more prestigious high art studio  assuming the name  patricia peppoire  as more befitting her new station in life as a serious actress  at some point it may occur to us  as it surely did to viewers in   that davies  rival gloria swanson started out in keystone comedies before rising to prominence in serious dramas for cecil b  demille  and as miss peppoire takes herself more and more seriously  giving the high hat treatment to former colleagues such as lowly comic billy boone  davies  performance takes on an element of wicked parody seemingly aimed squarely at swanson herself  this is especially notable during an interview sequence  when miss peppoire s spokesman spouts pretentious nonsense while the star delivers a spot on impersonation of swanson  i suppose this was intended as a friendly spoof  but i have to wonder how friendly relations were between gloria and marion after this movie was released   in any event  show people is a delicious treat for buffs  who will relish the parade of star cameos throughout  charlie chaplin contributes a nice bit  sans makeup and looking quite distinguished  eagerly seeking patricia peppoire s autograph   and in a show of good sportsmanship marion davies herself puts in a self mocking cameo appearance  evening the score for poking fun at swanson by poking fun at herself  this is a silent film that viewers not especially attuned to silents might appreciate  at least those viewers with a taste for movies about the movie business  show people surely belongs in the company of such classics as sunset boulevard and singin  in the rain  among hollywood s most expertly produced  enjoyable exercises in amused self examination
