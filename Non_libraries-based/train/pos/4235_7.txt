 after   years tim burton finally disappoints me  whatever happened to the old burton who read  the dark knight returns  by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in   by the looks of it burton didn t research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong  this movie sucks  it s not as good as the original and it doesn t deal with the same subject as the original  if you want a good ape movie watch the original    out of stars
