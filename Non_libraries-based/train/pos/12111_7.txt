when i first started watching this anime i never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting  but thankfully i was mistaken  from the moment i started watching it  anime just pulled into the world of bread making  i was hooked   the biggest advantage of this anime is it s humor  which is very intelligent and very funny  with some recurring gags  but the animation  soundtrack and character development are below average  while these disadvantages aren t seen so much in the first episodes  because of the great job on this anime  it really starts to show in the last   episodes  when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old  and aren t as funny as before   as far as i m concerned  if this anime had ended with episode   i would have given it a   but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste  which sadly can t be washed away by the awesome   episodes
