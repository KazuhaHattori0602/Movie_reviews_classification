for me this movie was powerful  i don t want to be a spoiler  but i had a friend years ago  we were like brothers  this movie brought back some vivid memories   for some reason  i couldn t place my vote for this movie which would have been a   i kept getting a message like  no votes have been placed  and yet i saw in the stats that there were  will try again tomorrow  monday   minor flaws i overlooked  it was the relationships between the characters that got me  beautifully acted and real situations  i ve been in a couple of them   a small gem of a movie  just like  spring forward  is another overlooked gem  i m very glad movies like these are still being made  about relationships between people  well written  sensitively unfolded with first class acting and direction  after all  isn t that what it s all about
