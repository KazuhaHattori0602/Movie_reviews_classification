simply well written  directed and acted  woody s best of the  s if not his best since the  s  hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll  scarlett johansson s banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become   it s refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady  he plays the perfect bumbling magician   there have been a few reviews maligning this movie  don t let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film  people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line  if you like woody allen films of the  s  you ll regret missing this one   i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind  if you do  you might walk out smiling
