utterly tactical  strange  watch for the kinky moment of a drop dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull string doll for some rich folks  pointless but undoubtedly compelling late night feature  this unhinged french production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars  if somewhat anti heroes  alain delon and charles bronson  really they don t get to do all that much  especially during the confined  lengthy mid section where they hide themselves in a building during the christmas break to crack a safe with   possible combinations  oh fun  but this is when the odd  if intriguing relationship is formed between delon and bronson s characters  after a manipulative battle of wills  and childishly sly games against each other  the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other s involvement and have a mutual respect  this would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve ball  still their encounters early on suggest there s more  but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that  what just happen there  ending that might just make you jump  yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhhh  glad to get that out of the system    the pacing is terribly slow  but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy  nervous underlining tension  watch as the same process is repeated over and over again  and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play  now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous  but the climax payoff is haunting  the taut  complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good  but there are some neat novelties  coins  glass and liquids
