everything i remember about it was excellent  great cast with sam waterston   george innes  before he became more familiar to us audiences  excellent scripts as only the english can do   edwardian sherlock holmes lord peter wimsey albert campion type mysteries  but with a jules verne twist  sort of like macgyver would have been had it been in england   years earlier  right at the beginning of the scientific technological revolution of the  th century   i ve often wondered if the creators of macgyver saw these shows  macgyver first aired about   years later   i still have   episode on a much deteriorated tape
