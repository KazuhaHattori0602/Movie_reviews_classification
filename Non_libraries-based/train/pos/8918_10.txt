no hidden agenda  pure scifi  all fun   i saw the original on tv and was scared pretty bad  i was a kid    the original one can be appreciated more when compared to the new one which i saw and have forgotten  the original one  starring the great movie star steve mcqueen  bullet  is by far the better and only version anyone should see   the movie production is dated  but the fx used to make the blob stands up the test of time  i was convinced that that thing was moving on its own accord      zafoid
