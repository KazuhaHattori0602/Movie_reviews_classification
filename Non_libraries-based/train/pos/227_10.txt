  movie database  after seeing this film  you may think duvall s appearance is reincarnation at it s best  one of my most favorite films  i wish the composer  peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available  wonderful scenery and music and  all too true to life  especially for those of us that live in  or have moved to  the south  this is a  real moment in time  life moves on  slowly  but  strangers we do not remain
