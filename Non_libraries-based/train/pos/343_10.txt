   and that younger version of denise richards looked frightfully like her   highlights  every death scene had a particular distinction to it  the creepiest being the opening scene in the morgue  the hottub scene  while ludicrous  was well done  and the audiovisual maze was sinister  the soundtrack is great  with creepy music and some fine alternative tunes   lowpoint  i felt as though the killer wasn t featured enough  we barely saw the mask  and it wasn t featured at all during the climax  i also thought the climax was really unfocused  but fun nonetheless   the twist at the end wasn t that big of a surprise  but i m really glad that the filmmakers decided to spare us that whole  explaining killer  routine   i don t like to tell people which movies they should see  but if someone asked me to pick a horror movie that i thought was really worth seeing  then valentine would be it   my rating     bullseye
