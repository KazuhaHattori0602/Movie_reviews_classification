i was totally impressed by shelley adrienne s  waitress    this movie only confirms what was clear from that movie  adrienne was a marvelously talented writer director  an original and unique artist  she managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency  ally sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge  male lead reg rodgers  looking like judd nelson  is fine  there is also a great cameo by ben vereen  the song at the end of the movie  the bastard song  written by adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy     it s a world of suffering   in a sea of pain   no matter how much sun you bring   you re pummeled by the rain   don t let the heartless get you down   don t greet the heartless at your door   don t live among the heartless
