we have high expectations with this one       because its zombi   the official sequel to zombi   and directed by lucio fulci       however       its co directed by bruno mattei  from night of the zombies  and not written by dardino sachetti but by claudio fagrasso  night of the zombies  and its shot in the phillimines like night of the zombies and resembles night of the zombies  hell of the living dead  a lot  as a result its more like a companion to hell of the living dead than zombi   fabrazio deangelis who produced zombi   and its editor tomassi   and efx gianetto de rossi gave zombi   its magic       zombi   is not magical       its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut butter  but over the years  i ve grown to accept zombi   i could swear i saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room       there was a senseless fulci cut and the mattei fulci cut is the one on dvd
