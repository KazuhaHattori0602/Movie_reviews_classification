i have watched this movie well over   times  and i love it each and every time i watched it  yes  it can be very corny but it is also very funny and enjoyable  the camp shown in the movie is a real camp that i actually attended for   years and is portrayed as camp really is  a great place to spend the summer  everyone who has ever gone to camp  wanted to go to camp  or has sent a child to camp should see this movie because it ll bring back wonderful memories for you and for your kids
