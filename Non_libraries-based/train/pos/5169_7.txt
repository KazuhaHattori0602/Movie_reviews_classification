i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in   or   one night when i was channel surfing before going to bed  and really liked what i saw  since then i ve been on the lookout  scouring tv listings  flipping through dvd vhs racks at stores  but didn t find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it  then  being a world class procrastinator  i still didn t order it  finally  i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland  or  a few weeks ago  then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching it   so  what do i think about the film  it s good  not as good as i remembered and hoped for  but still well worth the   it cost me  after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a   with potential to become an   i ll have to be less sleepy then  and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue
