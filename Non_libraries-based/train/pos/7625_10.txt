although kurt russell was and is probably the closest person to look like elvis in show business  so many things were false in this film  first of all  the makers claimed elvis opened his famous live shows in   after a   year hault for films by wearing a white jump suit made in   also they claimed he sang  burning love  which he first sung in   and  the wonder of you  which he first recorded in   they also claim that he got his first guitar for christmas when all elvis fans know he got it for his birthday  i know all movies based on past have something false but these things are so obvious to people who like elvis
