john cassavetes    film opening night is  what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist   overlooked  it is an excellent film  in its own right  and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film  it s not a perfect film  in that  at two hours and twenty four minutes it s about a half hour too long  and there s a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character myrtle gordon  played by gena rowlands  the wife of cassavetes  long after we ve gotten the point  but only woody allen s masterpiece  another woman  which also starred rowlands  eleven years later  is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman  yet  rowlands did win the best actress award at the berlin film festival for this portrayal  and it was well deserved  often this film  written by cassavetes  is easily compared to his earlier  and inferior  film  a woman under the influence  but it s a spurious comparison  rowlands  character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start  as well as coming from a blue collar background  while her characters in this film and in allen s film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions  in this film it s the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as myrtle s younger doppelganger  while in allen s film it s her character s own past
  many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic  seeing myrtle surround herself with enablers  such as a stage manager who tells her  during opening night   i ve seen a lot of drunks in my time  but i ve never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up  you re great  but this is wrong  for alcohol isn t her problem  nor is her chain smoking  they are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction  and much to cassavetes  credit  as a storyteller  he never lets us find out exactly what s wrong with myrtle  and despite her coming through in the end  there s no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence  this sort of end without resolution links cassavetes directly with the more daring european directors of the recent past  who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience  and forcing their viewers to cogitate  even if it hurts   yet  the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog  and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama  whether or not myrtle gordon does recover  after the film s universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide  and as we have seen before that lid closes  one s choices do matter
