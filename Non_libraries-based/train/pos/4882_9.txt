it s a funny business  reviewing movies  these days when  internalized emotions  and  emotional detachment  are favored over straightforward sentimentality  it must be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings   soon after completing jury duties at the  th berlinale  i managed to catch yoji yamada s kabei   after the screening  i watched folks dreamily amble out of the theatre hall  watery eyed  men  women  and reviewers alike  even the director of the berlinale  obviously a hardened viewer of cinema  confessed to having been caught unawares and found himself crying three quarter s way into this unashamedly sentimental experience   but what really surprised me were the reviews that came after  despite being ineffably moved by the film  many reviewers chose to be tepid and emotionally non committal in their writing  apparently  post weeping  they had put on their  thinking cap  and consequently  missed out on what i felt was the genius about kabei   allow me to explain   set in pre war japan  the story of kabei revolves around one writer s family  and their fate therein  after he is held in jail for what was described as  thought crimes  against the imperial will  through a series of protracted emotional scenes  yamada gets us familiar with the man  his loyal wife and two daughters  as well as three side characters the man s pretty young sister  a bumbling ex student  and a cad of an uncle   all come to help the family cope with their plight  in the absence of the man of the house   the story moves along at a slow albeit steady pace  and heartbreaks occur at precisely the moments everyone is able to predict  this of course makes it near impossible for anyone in the audience to get too emotionally distraught by any dramatic event   in other words  although you learn to love the family and their helpers  and sympathize with their unfortunate situation  you get so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you find yourself expecting a particular kind of ending   however  two hours into the film  don t worry  yamada provides the viewer with sufficient moments of gravity and levity to tide you along  he slaps you with what i can only describe as  the sting  all that you have assumed to be what the story was about an innocent man wrenched from his faithful wife and daughters   now suddenly points to one of the family helpers  someone you have hitherto taken for granted is now thrown into an unexpected twist of fate   at this point  something curious happened in the theatre i was in  everyone started sobbing with little or no inhibition    my word  i muttered under my breath  it struck me then that  kabei  in the final analysis  was more than a film about a family torn apart by an empire on the verge of war  it was  in fact  a cunning examination of one common human foible  how little we cared about the secret feelings of people who are closest to us   now  the most common criticism made about the film was that it was technically solid  but lacked innovation  that s what happens when reviewers put on their proverbial thinking cap  i guess  with kabei  i believe yoji yamada knew exactly what trick he was going to employ to touch on one unique aspect of humanity  a wicked old trick he so seamlessly applied in the tora san series  and later  in tasogare sebei   after lulling the audience into a sort of narrative comfort zone  he throws us into a realm of emotions rarely explored in cinema   this  to me  is the most effective cinematic tool of all  one which avoids detection  but affects you deeply  and proof of its effectiveness was a thousand wet pieces of kleenex  thrown into a litter bin just outside of that thousand seater cinema hall   now if only some reviewers would resist being so caught up with being smart that they forget what cinema is really about  human emotions  pure and simple
