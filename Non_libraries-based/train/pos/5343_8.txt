some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing  such is the case for carol s journey  el viaje de carol  a beautifully crafted   film from spain based on the novel  a boca de noche  by  ngel garc a rold n who also adapted the book as a screenplay  war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films  but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters  especially children  who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults  the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre   carol  clara lago  is a  year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora  mar a barranco  returns to her aurora s home in   at the height of the spanish civil war  a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio  lvaro de luna  since his wife s death  carol s father robert  ben temple  is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family  aurora has a past  she left her lover alfonso  alberto jim nez  to marry robert  and alfonso in turn married aurora s cold sister dolores  lucina gil  carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her  class  tomiche  juan jos  ballesta  and his two friends at first resent carol  but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love  when aurora dies of her illness  carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca  luna mcgill  yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother s best friend and teacher maruja  the always radiant rosa maria sard  to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side  through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults  facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime  the ending  though sad  is uplifting as carol s journey to maturity is complete   the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f  berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendiz bal  director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos  and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved  he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war  the cast is exceptional  the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan jos  ballesta  but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles  this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date  grady harp
