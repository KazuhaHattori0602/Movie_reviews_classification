this movie was excellent for the following reasons    it contained great backdrops and sets    it showed the disparity of a war torn environment alongside a technological one    john cusack s acting was terrific  he portrayed angst very well    it showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war torn situation    it gave us a picture of what might happen in the future in many respects  i was also impressed with the acting for the most part  hilary s acting was  i found  the most stilted  the morals and values of everyone in a war torn situation are up for grabs  the liberal journalist and the conservative business man are capable of doing anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable  great stuff  psp
