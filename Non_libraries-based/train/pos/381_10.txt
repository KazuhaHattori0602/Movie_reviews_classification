i gave this film   not because it is a superbly consistent movie  but for it s pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience  the story of one woman s struggle against all odds is an old clich  by now  but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple   it also showed a different side to the african american experience   showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated  white man  and were abusive of their own people  i find this an important point as it goes against the portray white on black violence and win an oscar trend   also the acting performances are superb   especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for   well worth watching   but keep some tissue handy
