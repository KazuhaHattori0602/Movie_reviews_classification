i saw this movie at midnight on on demand the other night  not knowing what to expect  i had heard of this movie  but never really any opinions on it   i have to say  i was impressed with what i saw  i was genuinely freaked out in some parts and i definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times   the blob was scary looking  now  i look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it ll latch itself onto my hand   steve mcqueen was really good as steve andrews  the protagonist of the film  i also liked the old man in the beginning   for a  s horror movie  this was very well done even by today s standards
