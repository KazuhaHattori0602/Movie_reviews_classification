i m sure this is a show no one is that familiar of and might not think good of it  after all it is almost close to baywatch hawaii  with the cast  the location  style of the directing and its publicity   shows women walking around on the beach and all that  no wonder people have misconception and decide not to watch it   it was wrong of them to do that  cause after i decide to watch the show  there are actually more thing going on  real juicy story and conflict  turn out to be really exciting to watch and pretty much   addictive   the story of the hotel clerks  the manager  the owner and their complicated love life  also enter the troublesome hotel s visitor and powerful man trying to steal the hotel  it actually more exciting than it sounds here   i won t deny that the acting suck but it ain t that bad that you ll look away  the story is not so consistence but good enough  the soundtrack is fitting pretty well with the scenario and the action is all the time  i took me couple of episode before there is actually anything happen solidly so be patience   recommendation  i really do enjoy watching this  zillion times better than expected   rating     grade  b   please rate my review after reading it  thanks
