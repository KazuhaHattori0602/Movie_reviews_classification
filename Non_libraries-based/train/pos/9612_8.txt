the good thing about this movie  the concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes  it also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing  its a small world and this little movie shows us   the bad thing there are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie   its a great movie and many people compare it to magnolia which i haven t seen      not rated i would rate it pg  for brief violence some language and sexual situations
