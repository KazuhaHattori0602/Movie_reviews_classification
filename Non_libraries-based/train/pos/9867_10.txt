i first saw ice age in the subiaco cinemas when it came out  back in   i was only   at the time  but even then i liked it  it had some sort of warmth   we ve had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it  it never gets boring  this is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other  d animations made at the time   the characters have no particular  home  which they leave  they are nomads  and that s really refreshing and uplifting to watch   also  each individual character on the surface  appear to be just putting up with each other  but they re really all good friends  as well  all of the characters have their own charms  even the bad guys  sid the sloth is charming in his annoying  over affectionate and naive sort of way  manny is adorable in his depressed  reclusive character  and so on and so forth   another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation  all the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay  giving the film an artistic edge   another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie  is that gender means very little  there are hardly any female characters  but you don t really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film  due to this  there s also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age   all in all  ice age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into  d animations before shrek   and the incredibles came out
