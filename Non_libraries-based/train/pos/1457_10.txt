i ve watched this documentary twice   and although i m an major movie buff  most documentaries don t hold my attention  this film however was mesmerizing  almost every shot is perfect   saying so much more than an audio commentary  which this documentary does not have   the concept of this film is amazing  i can t praise it enough  mardi gras beads   who would have thought    amazing and excellent choices of interviews   film footage of a factory in china   the film makes you feel like you are actually there   i m political aware   and i ve read several books on globalization so there wasn t anything in this film that was a surprise to me  however  it s made me think so much    i wish so much too  that this world was a better place   a million kudos to the filmmaker   and thanks for making this film too   i wish everyone could see it
