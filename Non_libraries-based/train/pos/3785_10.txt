this movie is very underrated  it s highly imaginative  creative and clever  it s just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one  but the film was forgotten when it first came out  and became even more overlooked as the years passed   bill   ted s bogus journey  also bombed at the box office  whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular    i think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late  in   bill and ted already seemed  so  s  even though the  s were only a couple years ago back at that time  the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap  hip hop  pearl jam  nirvana  grunge and the seattle sound  bill and ted with their ozzy osbourne  van halen and guns n  roses music along with their  s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in   and i think that s one big reason the film bombed at the box office  nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like  excellent  and  bogus  in    gremlins   which also came out in the early  s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the  s  the transition from the  s to the  s was a much faster change then now with the  s and  s    was nothing like   or   whereas right now    and last year   still looks looked like   or    if only  excellent adventure  which was made in   was released that year instead of   and  bogus journey  was made quickly and released in   then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first
