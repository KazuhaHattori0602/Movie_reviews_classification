last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made   capote and infamous   i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in   a stark  powerful and chillingly brutal drama  elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks  elmer gantry  cat on a hot tin roof  the professional  blackboard jungle   it is interesting that robert blake  who starred in this film  has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film   this is a film that stays with you after viewing
