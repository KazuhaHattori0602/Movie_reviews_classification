since the start of her career in the  s and vastly throughout the exuberant  s  elvira  cassandra peterson  has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror   bad monster movies  while ms  peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures  covering a wide variety in genres  it was her tv character elvira that brought her the most fame  part of her charm   and respect from the fans   lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous  unlike many other big name actors   actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their  early  work  i ve seen only bits   pieces of her tv performances  but her cameo role in ghoultown s recent tribute song  mistress of the dark  really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff  one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video  over the years  elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid s came around   and in   after films like  fright night  and  terrorvision  incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv work  it finally happened   elvira  mistress of the dark  the motion picture  now  i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days  but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film  a few years ago  i did manage to watch  elvira s haunted hills   made in   but for some reason it didn t impress me all that much  was it really that forgettable  or should i give it another watch  i actually really do feel like re watching it now  as this first elvira film from   really convinced me  though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work  might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script  there really is no way to deny it  cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy  she also co wrote the screenplay   when elvira learns she s one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt  she never heard of before  she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas  out to claim her rightfully inherited money  she travels to a quiet new england town  but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat  in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her  often unintentionally  provocative behaviour  to make things worse  her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected  a rundown mansion  a cookbook and a poodle  but what she doesn t know  and her evil uncle vincent albot does  is that her great aunt was a witch  and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable  and if you haven t turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe book  then rest assured  you re going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face   it s surprising how a script rigged together with boob jokes  witty one liners  movie references  inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story  simple  of course  but coherent  while other movies  heavily relying on gag like situations  often make you loose track of the story completely  like the  naked gun  films  for example  this film doesn t  a lot of horror comedies were being produced during the  s  but not a lot of them actually worked  let alone a horror spoof that doesn t derail at some point  killer party  although i m grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale  or becomes too tedious too quickly  saturday the  th  although  elvira  is more comedy than horror  it doesn t loose track of what it s doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale  complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot  including a real honest to god witch hunt and elvira s very own burn at the stake moment   i m telling you  there s no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny  one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already  when daniel greene s name appeared  daniel who  oh yes  i recognized his name  and later on his dim witted macho face  how can one not forget daniel greene once you ve seen   atomic cyborg aka fists of steel  but if you haven t seen  atomic cyborg  then i m sorry  but you won t be able to laugh with his face in this one  and on a side note  i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station  even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better
