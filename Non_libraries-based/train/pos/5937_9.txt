after seeing the  batman dead end  short  i didn t know what to really expect from world s finest  of course  superman and batman  all my world s finest comic books have them as the team up   after seeing this  and a half minute trailer  it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world s finest  if not an actual full length film   sure  some of the superman stuff was cheesy  but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers  giving you only certain aspects of the entire product  this looks like it needs a complete product   other than director sandy collera s relative playing an achingly poor perry white  most of the actors were unknown  if an actual movie was made  actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film  though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane  especially if given closer to the character dialogue   good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end  but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the  s batman with the  s s leather cape and cowl  his demeanor is batman like  but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask  i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona   michael o hearn cannot play superman  period  he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says   slap me  and line delivery seems to be a problem with him   overall  though  i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work  there was a rumor about a world s finest movie being made  and with the correct additions to the script  this could be it  hope more like this are made
