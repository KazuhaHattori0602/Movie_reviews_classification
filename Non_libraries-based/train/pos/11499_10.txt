since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed  this show was a  s version of the poplular  s tv series  x files  but with a bit more of a comedic light hearted approach  but don t get me wrong  some of these episodes have full on horror themes  many in which have some pretty greuesome plots  left to the imagination of course  this was the early  s television   some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting  but that is the charm and attraction to this series  whether you like mystery crime dramas  comedies  or sci fi horror themes  this series brought all that together  each episode clocked in at around   minutes or so   hour with commercials  and that   minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more  a great classic show that is underrated in my book
