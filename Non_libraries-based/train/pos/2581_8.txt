people are being too hard on the film  sometimes we should just sit back and enjoy the story without attempting to  review  it   the whole thing comes together when hackman decides not to pull the trigger but his target still goes down  then the fun begins as everyone about him also  go down   just think jfk and all the people associated in any way with his assassination  who s lives ended abruptly and in questionable ways and you ll appreciate what is implied in this film   i think it s an excellent interpretation of what may well have occurred  though the exact story line my not have been followed  hindsight here after reading jim maars  crossfire  but it s what is implied that is of interest   i d love to get a copy of it to view it again  in light of what is known today  the domino principle is right on
