although it s not as creepy as it s cult classic predecessor  zombi   i actually like this one better  this is because of it s faster pace  better settings  and cool  s soundtrack  it s loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by lucio fulci  the zombies don t quite look as nasty as in zombi   but they still look good  it was made pretty well but it definitely has it s share of cheesiness  for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas  some are braindead while others say funny lines  but who expects consistency when it comes to italian horror  there s even a flying zombie head  how rad is that  definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans  it d probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well  also check out zombi
