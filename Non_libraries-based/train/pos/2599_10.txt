having enjoyed joyce s complex novel so keenly i was prepared to be disappointed by joseph strick s and fred haines s screenplay  given the fabulous complexity of the original text  however  the film turned out to be very well done and a fine translation of the tone  naturalism  and levity of the book   it certainly helps to have read the original text before viewing the film  i imagine the latter would seem disjointed  with very odd episodes apparently randomly stitched together  without a prior reading of the text to help grasp the plot   it s amazing to see how  filthy  the film is  given that it was shot in dublin in   the irish film censors only  finally  unbanned it for viewing by general audiences in ireland as late as    it was shown to restricted audiences in a private cinema club  the irish film theatre  in the late  s  joyce s eroticism is not simply naturalistic and raunchy  it offers many wildly  perverse  episodes  never mind that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in     they were still utterly taboo when the film was made in    it is astonishing and heartening to watch the cream of the irish acting profession of the  s  respected players all  daring to utter and enact joyce s hugely transgressive text with such gusto   bravo
