farewell friend aka adieu l ami honour among thieves isn t perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault  one to return stolen bonds  the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend  naturally things aren t quite that simple even after they open the vault  leading to some neat twists and turns  on the debit side  there s a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park  bronson has a very irritating fonzie like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments  brigitte fossey  sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the  s  it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind  is something of a liability   her  i ll cook spaghetti  i ll learn to make love well  i ll read shakespeare  speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways   and it s a shame about the horrible last line shot  but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that s worth checking out if you can find a decent print   cinema club s uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack  but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that s no great problem  especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality
