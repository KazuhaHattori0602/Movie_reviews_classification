the film transported everyone back to october     where we seemed to be part of the great philippine  i shall return  landing scene
 it was on that leyte shore where general macarthur reaped his fame
   above all  gregory peck triumphed in his portrayal of the great general
 it is the stride  the set of the shoulders  the intensity
 it s what both men have had in common  intensity  total absorption  devotion
 with macarthur it was for the military
 with peck it was for the challenge of acting
 an academy award winner for  to kill a mockinbird  an oscar nominee for  keys to the kingdom   the yearling   gentleman s agreement  and  twelve o clock high he has played everything from an apparently homicidal amnesiac to a crusading journalist  from a troubled gunfighter to an obsessed attorney  from biblical david to captain horatio hornblower
 he has brought to them all his own unique insight  his character  his sincerity  warmth and love  and especially  his humor
   there is a scene where  macarthur  stands on deck with the  president of the philippines  we can hear the dialogue   general  i hope the water isn t too deep  says the  president   because my people will find out i can t swim  then come peck s sonorous voice   and my people are going to find that i can t walk on water    as  macarthur  peck once again justified his reputation as a giant in the film industry
 through him we felt macarthur s emotions  we knew his anger  his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family
