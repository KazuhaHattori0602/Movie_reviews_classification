it is ironic that during the  s  when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal  he was virtually ignored by the critics
 he is now seen  however  as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama
   written on the wind  is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation  alcoholism  and nymphomania
 it is about the twisted  fatal connections between sex  power  and money   stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration  arrogance  jealousy  insanity  and some deep insecurities
  dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites  degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in town
 her best line   i m filthy  in one frantic scene  we see her shaking  quivering and sweating to a provocative mambo
 in another weeping alone over a model oil derrick at her father s desk symbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny
  the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirk s magnificent use of colors  lights  and careful use of mirrors
