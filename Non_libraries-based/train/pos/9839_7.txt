hmmm  yeah this episode is extremely underrated   even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts  i think the good over wins the bad    i love the origami parts and the big  twist  at the end  i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony  it s actually one of my favorite scenes of season     for some reason  people have always hated the reincarnation episodes  yet i have always liked them  they re not the best  in terms of writing  but the theme really does interest me   i m gonna give it a three star  but if the writing were a little more consistent i d give it four
