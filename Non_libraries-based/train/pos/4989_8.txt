this is very dated  but that s part of the charm with this   movie  you can say the same for most pre code films  they re just different  and usually in an interesting way   it was the short running time  the great acting of spencer tracy and the beautiful face and sweetness of loretta young s character which kept me watching and enjoying this stagy but intriguing film   you d be hard pressed to find a nicer girl than  trinna  played by the  year old young who was already into making her  th movie   she started acting as a small child  that  and the fact they made movies quickly back in the old days  the camera  although in soft focus throughout much of the film  zoomed in on loretta s face and eyes many times and i was mesmerized by her beauty   playing a crotchety man with a cynical outlook on life  tracy s  bill  slowly transformed into a loving man  thanks to trinna  spencer delivered his lines here with such naturalness that you hardly knew he was acting   although they have small roles  supporting actors walter connolly  marjorie rambeau  arthur hohl and glenda farrell leave lasting impressions long after viewing this  minute film  i was particularly fascinated with connolly s role as the minister father figure of the camp   the story is a little far fetched but   hey   that s the movies  this story is about two lonely great depression victims trying to survive in a  hooverville type camp and it winds up to be a very touching tale
