i thought the movie was fairly well done for a made for tv movie  and it contained both a lot of action and humor  i found the entertainment value worth watching  and would watch it again or a similar show again  i m disappointed that sean was not credited here on imdb   i can see a possibility for an action series based on this concept or a sequel with sean once again playing for even higher  cash  stakes  since his life would be on the line again anyway   i felt that sean played the role very well  and reminds me of an actor by the name of matthew ashford who plays jack deveraux on days of our lives   the soap opera
