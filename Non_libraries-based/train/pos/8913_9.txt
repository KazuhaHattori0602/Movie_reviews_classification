this is my favorite classic  it was filmed a little west of philadelphia  pa when i was   in   and released the next year  then in   i found myself working the very same county as a rookie pa state trooper  i have always enjoyed checking out the different places where scenes were filmed  i knew the owner of the downingtown diner well  and he had a road sign out front which told all passing motorists that this was the  home of the blob  the theater scene was in phoenixville  near valley forge park and it is still showing films today
