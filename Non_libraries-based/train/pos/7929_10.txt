there have been  race  pictures almost from the beginnings of the movie business  films starring almost entirely black casts have been made by segregated poverty row studios  more often than not owned by caucasians  for ghetto theaters  with the growing urban blight during the  s  this idea was revived with a wave of  blaxploitation  pictures made for urban grind houses which overlaid black actors and funky atmosphere over traditional b  movie plots  this trend even spread into horror features  with titles like blacula  blackenstein and sugar hill serving up blaxploitation versions of monster standards  and it didn t die with the closing of most urban theaters   it just slowly eased into the video age  and continues with low budget direct to dvd releases like this one  ed and jose quiroz s hood of the living dead  adopts the recent popularity of horror movies for the hip hop audience  ricky  carl washington  is a young scientist in oakland trying to keep his younger brother jermaine  brandon daniels  out of trouble after the death of their parents  after jermaine is shot by drug dealers in a drive by  ricky decides to use the experimental cell regenerating formula he s been working on in an attempt to save the teen s life  apparently his efforts are for naught  and jermaine s body is taken away  however  the body never makes it to the morgue   jermaine re animates in the coroner s van as a flesh hungry zombie  he kills the drivers  then goes after the gang that killed him  spreading the zombie infection wherever he goes  having heard from jermaine s friends kevin  derek taylor ii  and marco  raul martinez  about the attack on the gangsters  ricky feels that the only thing to do is to capture jermaine and try to cover up the whole matter before he and his accomplice scott  chris angelo  get arrested for the mayhem they ve caused  however  they soon find that the contagion is spreading too fast for them to control it  by keeping things simple  the quiroz team manages to produce an entertaining little horror feature without overextending themselves to the point where things start to look shoddy  along the way  they also add in a few interesting bits of business  when first confronted with a zombie  scott tells ricky   shoot him in the head like in the movies    an effective as any way to discover how to kill zombies  an extra twist is added when the first head shot doesn t kill the brain  adding to viewer unease  another good point is that the soundtrack makes only limited use of sub eminem style rap  laying in standard  creepy  music throughout
