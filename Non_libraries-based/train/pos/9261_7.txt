which do you think the average person would know more less about  iranian cinema or iranian football  interestingly  the two come to the forefront of controversial iranian filmmaker jafar panahi s latest film entitled  offside  a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one s right to do something or go somewhere and an individual s right to extend that courtesy if and when they d like to  the odd thing is  you don t come away from offside having learnt about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema  unless it s an education in panahi s controversial style  but you do come away feeling enlightened  that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran  and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it   i can remember the   world cup  i m sure many people can  it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year  a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic  needless to say  i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in spain   when it was thought west germany and austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of algeria   anyone in britain that was watching the bbc s broadcast of the iran   mexico game  both nations  first of the tournament  may remember that at the top of the show  the bbc s football anchorman gary lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match  it went something like   we ve seen giants germany  england  argentina and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it out  the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore  it s a shame because there are people  and films like offside present them  who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it s sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem  inferior  when there are others who d do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage   when immediately thinking of the words  iran   football  and  world cup  my mind flies back to the france   game between said nation and america  here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around iran s famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them  director panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude  you can imagine a heavy handed film detailing iran s  victory  as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they  defeat  a western power or  enemy  at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in   a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are   indian film  lagaan  in which the indian peasants defeat the ruling british at cricket  similalry   s  the game of their lives  sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the   world cup  the differences between these films and offside are immense  offside is looking at a situation behind a state s mentality and dares to explore an essence of feminism as the girls  trying to see their beloved iran defeat bahrain and qualify for the world cup  are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game  the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men  may  not will  but  may  use during the game  the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man s right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman s right to see the game all together   it is no wonder panahi s film was itself banned in iran   but panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones  two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match  panahi pays special attention to the title of his film  offside  which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an  attacker  is  caught  trying to gain an advantage in the field of play  the parallels run with the womens  position in the film as these advancing  supposedly without right  individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team  that being the state itself   i think offside is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding gulf area that i ve seen  it s a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus  the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo realist aura to it all  the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful  i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i ve mentioned shows a distinct level of callous  either that or you work in the iranian government
