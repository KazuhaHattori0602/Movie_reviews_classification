the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive  it s too much for my budget at the moment  or i would purchase it  because the film is a good example of film noir and i enjoy watching richard widmark  jean peters and thelma ritter   criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much  that s the case here for an  minute black and white  mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary  cinematography wise   the story is the story here  as opposed to visuals  actors  sound  sets  etc  as a pickpocket  widmark  inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters  purse   say that three times  everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie  widmark  the cops  the u s  agents and the communists and  especially ritter as  moe  an informant  she and widmark are the stars of this film   peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by  falling in love  with widmark on the first meeting even though he s nasty to her  only in world of film  too bad  because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it   this an average film noir which means good  but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of   for that price  one could do a lot better in the film noir market
