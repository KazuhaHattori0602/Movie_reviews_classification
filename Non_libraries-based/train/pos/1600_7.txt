this is not a bad film  it is not wildly funny  but it is interesting and  entertaining  it has a few funny moments  cher gives a good  performance in a role that is very opposite her real life self  her  performance alone is worth the watch  if this movie had come out  today it would not have been nominated  but by  s standards it  was excellent
