it s just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project  so refreshing and educating  not only to a filmmaker  who can learn what can be achieved in   minutes of screen time  but also as audience  who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time     short films about love in paris are all unique  but some of them  as expected  stand out  i thought the tom tykwer  natalie portman  segment was the best  although the mimes made me smile inside just the same   i clicked on  spoilers  option for this review bus alas what you read is a spoiler enough  just watch it  don t read what i write  but watch the movie instead   and smile
