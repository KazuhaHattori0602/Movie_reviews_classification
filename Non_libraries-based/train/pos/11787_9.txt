it s a short movie from david lynch with just   minutes  but it got all the  lynchian ingredients  it s mysterious  dark  inconclusive  eerie  and strange  and before the blond girl starts to talk it s even a bit scary  the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it s also sinister and mysterious
   about the setting itself  it hasn t the  traditional  red curtains  but it has socking purple painted walls  which give it an equally effect of eeriness   the plot is about a girl who s locked in a dark room and she cries for help  then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way  saying she s there just because of her fault
 we don t know what did happen or what will happen next
 it ended unsolved and puzzling  as a good lynch movie must end    it s a great short  despite some amateurish acting  the girls are professional actresses  but i think their acting could have been better in this short
