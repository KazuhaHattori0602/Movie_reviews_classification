every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing  before davis co stars with leslie howard in  of human bondage  she d been in over a score of movies  legend has it that davis was  robbed  of a   oscar for her performance as a cockney speaking waitress  unwed mother   manipulative boyfriend user  mildred rogers  the story goes that the afi consoled davis by awarding her  st oscar for playing joyce heath in  dangerous  i imagine davis  fans of  of human bondage  who agree with the oscar robbing legend are going to have at my critique s contrast of the   film for which the afi didn t award her performance   the   film  dangerous  performance for which she received her  st oscar in    i ve tried to view all of bette davis  motion pictures  tv interviews  videos  advertisements for wwii   tv performances in popular series  in hindsight  it is easy to recognize why this film   of human bondage  gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance  she was only  yo when the film was completed   just about to reach hollywood s red carpet  the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in  of human bondage  that is what makes it her legendary performance  but  rko saw her greatness in  the man who played god    borrowed her from warners to play rogers   i m going to go with the afi  in hindsight  some   years after their astute decision to award davis her  st best actress oscar for  dangerous    years later  by doing so  the afi may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of hollywood s most talented  th century actors  because  from  of human bondage  onward  davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue  doubtless  she deserved more than   oscars  perhaps as many as     dangerous  provides an exemplary contrast in davis  depth of acting characterization  for  it s in  dangerous    that she becomes the greatest actor of the  th century  davis is so good as joyce heath  she s dead center on the red carpet  whereas in  of human bondage  davis is right off the edge  still on the sidewalk   ready to take off on the rest of her   year acting career   perhaps by not awarding her that legendary oscar in   instead of a star being born  an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor s greatest work   it is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was joan crawford  a star whose performances still don t measure up to davis  even anna nicole smith was a  star  howard stern is a radio host  star  too  lots of people on stage   the silver screen are stars  few became great actors  the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense  the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck   try comparing these two movies as i have  viewing one right after the other  maybe you ll recognize what the afi   i did  davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the  th century at  yo   achieved her goal by the time she was   she spent her next   plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached       yet   had the afi sent her the message that she d arrived in  of human bondage  davis  life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck dom  instead
