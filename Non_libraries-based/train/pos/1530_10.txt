old people show  i m   and have been watching the show since i was   recoding it onto my sky  box everyday from hallmark and bbc   i really wish they hadn t cancelled it  they didn t even get a proper farewell  but what an adventure  all those episodes  i think i ve seen them all  and not one comes to mind that i didn t like and enjoy   its a shame the bbc keep swapping between diagnoses murder and  murder she wrote  never watched it and don t intend to  anyways  he characters in diagnoses murder are so in depth  and the chemistry between the actors is amazing  it really was a sad day when they cancelled this show
