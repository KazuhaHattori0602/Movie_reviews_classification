this movie is pretty cheesy  but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it s principles  there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well   the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie   i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran  sure it s not all that well done  but the premise is not at all bad   tom
