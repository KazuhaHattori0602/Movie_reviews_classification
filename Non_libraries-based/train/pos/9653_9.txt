first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema   the all encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or  worse  slightly ridiculous   lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving  sexy  thoroughly engrossing tale of love  disaster and possible redemption  while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence   the core story is of mathieu    a solitary  introverted boy who meets c dric  brasher  more outgoing but just as lonely  while on holiday with his family  as the summer warms on  they fall in love and  when the holidays end  decide to live together  a year later  the relationship ends in catastrophe  c dric cheats on mathieu who  distraught  tries to take his own life  he survives and  in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met  this time cloaked in the chill of winter   if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does  much of it is implied  all of it happens non sequentially   the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced  through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective  fortunately  the three time lines used  the summer of love  the post suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction  are colour coded  warm yellows and oranges for the summer  an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside   both main actors put in excellent performances though  whilst it s a delight to see st phane rideau  c dric  used to his full capacity  i m more used to seeing him under stretched in gael morel s rather limp dramas  j r mie elkaim  mathieu  has to be singled out for special mention  you can feel his loneliness  then his almost incredulous passion  then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia  beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could   the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema  our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling  our difficulty in communicating fully  the shifting sands of meaning
 the film s title  presque rien   almost nothing  points to all of these and  indeed  to one of the key scenes in the film  in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself  a psychiatrist asks c dric if he had ever cheated on him
  non
 enfin  oui
 une fois  mais ce n tait rien   no
 well  yes
 once  but it was nothing  c dric still loves mathieu   he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt  none of which we see  and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves   but cannot understand that he has lost him forever  because something that seemed nothing to him  a meaningless affair  is everything to mathieu   whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest  it is not without hope  we get to see c dric s slow  painful attempts to get back in touch with life  first through a cat he adopts  then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre  who may be his next love  but here the story ends  a teenage passion  over within the year  another perhaps beginning  so what was it  almost nothing  certainly not when you re living it
