this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen  and  in my opinion  a lot better than hero or chrouching tiger  hidden dragon  the movie is a unique combination of several genres  it s a beautiful love story  action movie  comedy and horror at the same time  and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this   this movie definitely makes it to my top   and should be enjoyable to every movie lover  the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying  but the way it s shot differs from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense  ghosts can fly   see this movie  you won t regret it
