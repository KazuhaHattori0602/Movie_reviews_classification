and this is a very disturbing film  i may be wrong  but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor  who transformed the role  and delivered a message   jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent  they are unassuming and unaware  businessmen wanting to enjoy the country  little did they know what would happen next   the photography and sets are realistic and natural  this was before the days of wes craven   what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist  in america  country folk still detest city people  it is almost a century and a half since the civil war   you will enjoy this film  it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia  which still exist  just don t drive past that to mobile  alabama  that area still has not been repaired since hurricane katrina
