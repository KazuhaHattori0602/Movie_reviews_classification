this is such a great film  never mind the low rating here  i really have no idea where that came from  they must be discussing a different film then  because i absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure    it s story was so original and charming  i really can t think of anything bad to say about it  maybe it has to be  your type of thing  but  i saw this with my sister and my mother  and we all were taken by it    the acting was also very good  and that is hard to do in a film like this  but i found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic    i ve always been very fond of dougray scott and found his new  dark  role very interesting  it is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy  but i absolutely had no problem with that this time  even more so  i adored him    everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film  no question about that  anyone wanting to see a film with   bloodshed  should go rent something else  though  but i guess the title already kind of gives that away  this is a love story  not saw    i give this film   out of five stars  good job   xxx enjoy
