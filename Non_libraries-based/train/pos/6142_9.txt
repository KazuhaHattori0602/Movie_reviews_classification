delightful disney film with angela lansbury in fine form as a middle age spinster whose interest turns to witchcraft in world war   england   lansbury was about age   at the time of the film and she is just ideal for the part  she is jessica fletcher again but this time it s for the benefit or children and for mother england during a time of great peril   the film follows the adventures of miss price  lansbury  and david tomlinson as the professor of witchcraft in trying to obtain certain information on sorcery  those   little darlings sent to live with price to escape the london bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting film for all of us regardless of age   too bad that tessie o shea  roddy mcdowall and sam jaffe are given so little to do in this endearing film   i really thought of the ben stiller film night at the museum  at the end of the film when the relics come to life to do battle with the nazi invasion in the small british coastal town
