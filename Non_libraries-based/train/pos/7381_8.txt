ivan  marco ricca  and gilberto  alexandre borges  are partners in a company together with estev o  george freire  but the first ones contract a professional killer  anisio  to murder estev o  the plot  at least at the beginning  doesn t explain very well why  the guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners  appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there  as supervisor or something
  at the same time he meets marina  mariana ximenes  daughter of estev o  and starts dating with her    in a story like this  where crime  corruption  betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand  no one is innocent or can be victimized  exception made to marina  which is the only person who doesn t know what s going on and didn t betray anyone
   this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like s o paulo  where crime is every day s presence  we can feel irony but also veracity in characters like anisio  brilliantly played by paulo miklos  which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples  and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed  he really must be a monster to do something like that  but of course i know there re people like him out there  in brazil or any other place
   it s a very good movie  cruel but truthful  about a sad reality
 the acting is great and the soundtrack too
