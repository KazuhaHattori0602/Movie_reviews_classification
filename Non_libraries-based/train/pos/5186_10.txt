i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd  i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series  for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs   or   episode collections or when sci fi would re run the episodes  however  when sci fi would host the re runs  they generally stuck to the same episodes  there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn t repeat  does anyone know exactly how long this series ran  it says   to   at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years  if you loved the twilight zone  night gallery and outer limits  you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
