as a popular sport  surfing was liked by many people  just after watched the documentary  i realized how dangerous it could be  in fact the surfers also scared of big waves  even somebody got killed by it  but they still kept on surfing and enjoyed themselves  only brave people can do it   according to what the surfers said  we can clearly knew what they felt when the big wave came at them  you have to adjust to your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave  when you win it  that will obviously bring you huge satisfaction   the amazing cinematography cannot be overlooked  that is absolutely visual enjoyment   an excellent sports documentary
