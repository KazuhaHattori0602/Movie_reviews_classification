i ve seen this film literally over   times it s absolutely jam packed with entertainment  powers boothe gives a stellar performance  as a fan of actors such as william shatner  impulse    and ron liebmann  up the academy   i never thought an actor could capture the  intensity  like shatner and liebmann in those roles  until i saw boothe as jim jones  as far as i m concerned  powers boothe is jim jones this film captures his best performance
