director   writer michael winner s feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film  although still schlock efficiently catered for  which really does by go unnoticed  sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period  but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material  of good vs  evil  and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive  if somewhat exploitative set pieces  as a whole it s sketchy  however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang busters with the scares  actually there s always something going on amongst its busy framework  but it s rather down played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring  up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation  winner s dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian  however it s the ensemble cast that really holds it together
 as you try to spot the faces  there s plenty too  some having more to do with the scheme of things than others  but there s no doubts every one of them are committed  despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all  it s interesting to see names like sylvia miles  who s significantly creepy  beverly d angelo  likewise  deborah raffin  eli wallach  christopher walken  william hickey  a neat cameo  jeff goldblum  jerry orbach and tom berenger in bit parts  then you got a mild mannered chris sarandon and movingly gorgeous cristina raines in the leads  offering able support jos  ferrer  martin balsam  ava gardner  john carradine  burgess meredith and arthur kennedy  the script does throw around many characters  as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in  however it s disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what s really going on here  is there a reason for all of this  and why is it surrounding raines  character  the emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle  as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange worrying experiences she encounters when she s moves into her new apartment  this is where winner tries to pull out the eerie shades  which projects some icy moments  gil melle was the man responsible for the grand  overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and richard c  kratina instruments the sweeping  scope like photography
