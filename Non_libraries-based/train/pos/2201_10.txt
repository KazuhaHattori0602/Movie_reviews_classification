i ve just finished viewing the  st disc in a  disc   episodes  collection created in conjunction with the ucla film   television archive  s more entertainment  inc  so far  aside from the  st episode  the image quality is quite good  the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb    mr  peepers  is just as charming as when i first saw it  years old at the time  and wally cox is truly endearing in this role  if you re in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you  as opposed to hitting you over the head  you ll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood  although some of the gags are a bit corny  most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun  this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it
