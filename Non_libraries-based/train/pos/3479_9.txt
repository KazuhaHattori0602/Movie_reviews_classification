this show started out with great mystery episodes  i think everyone is in the first   or   episodes  after that  the show started playing short episodes with shaggy  scooby doo  and scrappy doo   i think hanna barbera productions had to change   minutes episodes into short episodes  some of the voice actors became unavailable  after   or   episodes  frank welker  who played fred  became unavailable  i think the voice of velma changes after first   episodes  because the first voice actress who played velma was unavailable   and the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy  scooby doo  and scrappy doo  because the ratings were high  so they had to make more shorts  i wish they were mysteries like   episodes  still it is a good show
