much like the comedy duo of its title   the sunshine boys  has become a forgotten classic  odd years later  it s hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the  s  this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film  perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote   walter matthau plays willy clark  once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark  now a bitter  year old solo act who can t get a job in a potato chip commercial  his nephew and agent ben  richard benjamin  is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis  george burns  for an abc tv celebration of show business nostalgia   nostalgia is what  sunshine boys  has going for it in spades  right from the start when a series of  s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter s  be a clown  then there s the film s present day setting in manhattan  where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound  the periods collide in willy s glorious mess of a manhattan apartment  where framed photos and cartoons of long dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags  if you were alive in the  s like me  you might even feel like you were in that apartment   willy clearly has been living there too long  he s sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils  willy wakes up and picks up the phone    hello  who is this  a pause   never mind  it s the tea   old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else s hands  but simon s deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his   stage hit into comedy gold  the amazing thing about  the sunshine boys  is how much it rubs your noses in willy s almost existential condition without turning you off at all    years old and just like that  he dies of nothing  willy says of one old songwriting friend  before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed  lady  with  baby   burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis  but it s matthau who brings this one home  his make up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already   when he made this  willy is obnoxious in the extreme  fully deserving ben s description  crazy freakin  old man  but you root for him throughout  enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others  patience  his lines kill you  too  especially when he s trying to kill lewis  for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea    you re out of touch  willy tells lewis at one point   i m still in demand  i m still hot    if this room was on fire you wouldn t be hot  lewis replies   director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way  with low lighting and mid range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film s overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance  you never get the feeling you are watching a movie  one of  the sunshine boys  many charms  and ross s direction  like the acting of the three principals  goes a long way toward achieving that end   comedy is hard  especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by  but  the sunshine boys  makes it all seem a pleasure  because  for us watching  it is
