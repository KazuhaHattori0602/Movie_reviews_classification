before  zavet  there was similarity between tim burton and kusturica artistic vision  they find their own  poetic style  and then they cowardly become prisoners of it  burton has  and still have  depp  kusturica has miki manojlovic  and somehow they got critical praise for repeating same formula over and over again  however  there are persons like me who find joke funny only when they heard it first time  that s main reason why kusturica s worst movies are  black cat white cat  and  life is miracle   zavet  is something completely different  you may like it  you may hate it  but this is not just another kusturica poetic   balkanic dreamlike stuff  of course  if you want to be praised  you have to play safe  it was very easy for kusturica to make just another flying gypsies movie and get award  fortunately  as a brave person he chooses to make movie that will be ironic look to his previous works   zavet  can be described as a strong and very harsh parody on previous kusturica movies directed by kusturica himself  it is beautiful to see one big movie director to not take himself too seriously  this is quality that kusturica have and even the biggest  like bergman or kubrick  didn t have  this movie is so meaningless that becomes absurd  so absurd that becomes deep  and so unfunny that becomes hilarious  same stuff that make  plan   from outer space  cult would made this masterpiece to people who knows how to watch it  average western viewer would not get few references  most notable  tire shop owner is srbljanovic   and this refers to biljana srbljanovic  famous serbian dramatic writer  politically  she is very active as left oriented liberal  and she despises kusturica s political views and anarchism  kusturica s  everything but not subtle  take to her work was to castrate miki manojlovic in srbljanovic shop  second reference is made to goran bregovic   previous kusturica s composer  he formed  funeral and wedding orchestra  and start performing around europe  although he is praised as big composer  bregovic is just performer and most of his songs  if not all  are poor covers of traditional serbian songs  kusturica s take on bregovic was to confront one wedding and one funeral  with funeral mocking the wedding  also  music is covering western classics as  london bridge is falling down  or french lullabies  you find this unfunny  now you see how we feel in serbia when listening bregovic s horrible covers  i really liked this movie because it is not pretending to be deep  it is so overfilled with symbols that it becomes parody  and it is beautifully directed  as all of his works are  if you like previous kusturica s movies  there is a big chance that you will hate this  if you don t like couple of his last movies  you may find this as pleasant surprise  because this is like fellini directing  pink flamingos  on purpose  i have massive respect for this guy after  zavet  next tim burton movie would surely have main character with pale faces  next kusturica movies can easily be about aliens invading earth  that s the reason why he is most interesting director on earth  whether you like it or not
