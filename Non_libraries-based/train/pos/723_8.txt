riff randell is a wildly  obsessed fan of the rock group  the ramones and so are most of the students in the school  but a new tyrant of a principal  ms  togar thinks rock  n  roll is a bad influence on the students  especially the music from the ramones  so  when riff finds out they re performing in town  she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends  but when ms  togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets  while  this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff  but riff s friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom  but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song   fun  fun  fun  yep  that s right  rock n roll high school  doesn t drift away from it main focus
 a boisterously  daggy romp  it wasn t what i was expecting  that s for sure  everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they re having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit  which makes it a priceless experience  that s not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be  but watching this passionately  crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks  i just couldn t wipe the grin off my face  it s tacky  very cheesy  densely chaotic  but damn it s funky dory    this low budget  b grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co writer   and plus he co directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot  is basically a glorious homage on the rocking  s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clich s and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults  who always know best  these features might not be particularly fresh  but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically  gusto treatment  the film has just one thing on mind  to go out on a bang  and they manage to do that  courtesy of  the ramones  who play themselves  really  you could say its one big trendy video clip  since it s all about the ramones
 well  most of it anyway  i see a lot flack towards the ramones  acting ability  these are musicians not actors  which means it s not about their acting here  it s the music we re suppose to dig  they re here to perform  which  they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe  especially  their flamboyant concert performances  the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo  the velvet underground  mc  fleetwood mack  eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper  but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well  especially in the scenes involving ms  togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set  the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it s sometimes clever  tongue in cheek dialogue  thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags  which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself   what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles  better known for her performance in halloween  who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell  other exemplary performances were dey young  as the extremely cute kate rambeau  vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who s stupendously played by clint howard  also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who s excellent as the demanding ms  togar who s pushing her unfair reign on the students  paul bartel as mr  mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end  the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy  but that goes down well with the material and there s a certain likability stemming from these characters  but we totally despise ms  togar and her hall monitor goons   there s no beating around the bush here when i say  rock  n  roll high school  is an intoxicating hoot  of a rad time
