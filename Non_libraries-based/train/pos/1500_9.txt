now days  most people don t watch classic movies  such as this  most of friends only watch movies from the  s to present  thats kinda stingy    most old movies like this are masterpieces  unique in their own way  only because  back when these movies were being thought of and made  thats when ideas were fresh  now people strain just to think of new ideas    anyway  to the movie  for true fans of classic horror  this is for you  the movie is based with a investigator from scotland yard investigating the disappearance of an movie actor  and stumbles on to three other strange occurrences with past residents of the same house    i won t say anymore  for i will ruin the movie more than i already have  but it is a terrific movie for as old as it is  and would never mind watching it again
