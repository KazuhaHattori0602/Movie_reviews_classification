the first time i saw this film  i loved it  it was different   i am a christian  bible believing  i don t go along with the crowd of right wing believers  i dropped out of that atmosphere   to me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what judas tried to do  i call it the judas syndrome   judas didn t get it  even though jesus said his kingdom was not of this world   this film certainly showed some of that   i also liked that jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples   also he was a very gorgeous jesus   it s a watch over and over movie   very satisfying
