i only wish that return of the jedi  have been directed by somebody else  i mean  there is far too much ewoks scenes  completely unnecessary  besides this time our heroes look like different people  princess leia no longer fights with solo  luke looks boring  darth vader is not as evil as before  and yoda just dies   but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just can t hate it   some spoilers   jabba the hut   the sail barge attack sequence   the emperor  now that s evil    the speeders chase at the endor forest   the last battle   the dark side seduction scene   the return of anakin to the good side of the force    and the last celebration   some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes  if some scenes would have been cut  and another director was hired  this would have been as perfect as episode   and   but still is extraordinary    out of
