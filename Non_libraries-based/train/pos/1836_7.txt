time for a hit   waqt dir  vipul amrutlal shah cast  amitabh bachchan  akshay kumar  priyanka chopra  shefali shah  rajpal yadav and boman irani  written by  aatish kapadia rating     eureka  we ve got it  yes  ladies and gentlemen
in vipul shah s  waqt  we have probably found this year s first bona fide hit  replete with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial bollywood fare   waqt  has all that it takes for a movie to click with the indian audiences  it s the kinda film that makes a distributor feel happy and contemplate his next phoren visit  in this  saga of indian emotions  then  we have a happy family isn t it always  of three  ishwar amitabh bachchan  the postman turned millionaire don t ask how there s something about selling toys while delivering letters and all that
seriously  who gives a damn  married to sumi shefali shah  is a doting father to aditya akshay kumar  ishwar has to make a serious decision about his son s careless attitude towards the responsibilities of life  his love for aditya though  results in his procrastination of the grave issue  however  when faced with a situation that will test his race against time  ishwar has no alternative but to throw aditya out of the house  hoping that the new predicament might make him more conscientious of his own life  but this presumed solution becomes a problem in itself  as the rift between the loving father son increases and the fences continue to grow    you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story provides ample opportunities to infuse comedy and drama alike  so  pre interval you have the initially funny  later annoying comedy track of boman irani and rajpal yadav  and post interval there are the go for your kerchief moments between aby and akki  writer aatish kapadia he also penned the original gujarati play  aavjo vhala fari malishu  on which the film is based  does a good job of keeping the narrative fluid  the dialogues tend to get inconsistent at times  it doesn t help that songs appear like acne on a teenage face and mar the proceedings  clearly  a couple of numbers could ve been done away with  on the directing front  vipul shows that he possesses a natural flair for story telling   waqt  as well as his earlier debut effort  aankhen  manage to keep you interested till the last reel  on a personal note  the seesaw of emotions was a tad jerky for me  but gauging from the audience reactions  it was working to the hilt   finally   waqt  is all about its performances which amount to one whole point in the overall rating  amitabh bachchan is dependable as always  his energy is visible and so is his age  shefali pitches in a finely nuanced performance and matches the superstar at every step  boman and rajpal bring the house down with their histrionics  priyanka has little to do than fulfill the perfunctory role of a heroine  when it all boils down though   waqt  is akshay s vehicle  i have always maintained that akki is as good as the role suits him  put him in a  mujhse shaadi karogi  and he s fantastic  but in a  bewafaa  he is woefully bad  here  akki is probably at his best  whether it is his comic timing or his emotional renderings  he is near perfect  there s also an action scene for his fans  ironically  his previous best endeavour was in  aankhen  with the same director and big b at his side    waqt  is by no means a memorable movie  it s not one that will feature in the better films of our industry  but it is one for the masses  and at a time when the industry is waiting desperately for a universal hit   waqt  might just do the trick     abhishek bandekar  trivia  this is akshay kumar s second consecutive film after  bewafaa  in which he performs on stage during the climax   rating       poor   average   good   very good   excellent   nd april
