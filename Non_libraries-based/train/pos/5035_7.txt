mcconaughey in a horror thriller  i had to see this  i was pleasantly surprised   the plot is told in flashback mode  and it concerns an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament  i can t say much more without spoiling the whole movie  sorry  just know that if you decide to watch it  you ll be  in the very least  surprised   all the main players are very good  bill paxton did a great job directing those kids  and his acting is awesome  mcconaughey s acting is solid throughout and fits the bill perfectly   this movie challenges you to think  is dad crazy  is there a god  do demons exist  how far would you go to right a wrong  and what is  right  anyway  i m still thinking   and thus i recommend  frailty    and this is one of those movies that deserves and rewards a second  or even third viewing
