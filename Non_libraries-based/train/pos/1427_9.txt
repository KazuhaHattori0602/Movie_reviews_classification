i ve heard nothing but great things about the   television mini series   planet earth  narrated by my childhood idol david attenborough  nevertheless  whether it was screened down here in australia or not  i never caught up with it  and when i happened upon the opportunity to see  earth     a feature length compilation of the same nature footage   on the big screen  i jumped at the chance  the theatre was basically empty  just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me  and it was as though i had  not only the big screen to myself  but  indeed  the entire planet earth  for   minutes  i was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness  amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film  awesome in its scope  and yet painfully intimate at times   earth  is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet  and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction   though the film  directed by alastair fothergill and mark linfield  obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness  it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda  and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether  indeed  there is not a human in sight  instead  we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world  to experience the resilience  and also the fragility  of life on earth  i hear that the original mini series  which ran for eleven episodes  delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems  but i think that  here  the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact  i can t remember the last time that i felt so inspired  and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time  by establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals  anthropomorphising them to an extent  we are suddenly able to appreciate the  human side  of each species  and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy    earth  is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes  whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the arctic ice  or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life saving seasonal floodwaters of the okavango delta  the documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death  most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator prey interactions  though occasionally  perhaps to cater towards a younger audience  the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment  i regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature  and the raw instinct that fuels these animals  final  hopeless efforts at survival  there s even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt  both in the slow motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey  the result of a single fateful misstep  or the majestic mid air leap of a great white shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion  it is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species   aside from these main stories  we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world  including the birds of paradise of papua new guinea  and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes  of course  entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone  and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly  by choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear  elephant and humpback whale   tracing their lifestyles  via some astonishing high definition time lapse photography  throughout a calender year   the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show  and only   minutes to show it  consequently   earth  left me thirsting for more  and  fortunately  i now have approximately eleven hours more  as soon as i can track down a copy of the dvd box set for  planet earth  uplifting and tear jerking  awe inspiring and heartrending   earth  is a truly magnificent documentary experience  and it might just be my favourite film of
