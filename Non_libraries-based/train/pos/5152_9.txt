 hitler  the rise of evil  is clearly produced by people emotionally unburdened by the horrors of world war   which makes watching a refreshing experience   i think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the nazi mechanism  of the utterly corrupt ways hitler used to make it to the top  having arrived there  this film ends   when on top  the  fuhrer    german for  leader  led his germany to the biggest   most devastating war in history of mankind  ending six years later in germany s utter defeat  as a result  germany lost its eastern provinces   about   of its prewar soil  and was forced to accept a   year split of its remaining territory  both west and east germany had to be rebuilt from scrap  their reputations severely damaged by the many nazi atrocities inspired by racism   as i said   hitler  the rise of evil  makes an good watch  set in an acceptable thirties environment  with  more than  competent acting  in particular peter o toole s role as the aged president von hindenburg stands out  even adds an extra dimension   my copy of  hitler  the rise of evil  also provides a second dvd with two good documentary films  one is about hitler s personality  the second deals with the forgery of the hitler diaries  in   this forgery caused a hilarious scandal in england and germany  damaging the reputations of several historians and journalists
