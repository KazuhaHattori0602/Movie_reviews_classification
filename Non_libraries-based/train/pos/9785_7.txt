let me be the first non australian to comment on this   i got the movie for hugo weaving and i watched it to the end  it s one of those  drama of life  films  as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive   i liked the light and the girls  the rest was without too much fault  but without too much merit either  i yearned for something like the interview  or at least some matrix villain element here and there  but nothing out of the ordinary  the story does teach one about facing one s own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you  but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close  so not much of an effort to change things is required   the  smart  american beauty sound alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack  but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after   minutes of film   in the end  i guess it did his job of presenting a part of australian life  but to me it didn t seem specifically australian  it could have been placed anywhere  and it didn t seem attractive as a story   i guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie
