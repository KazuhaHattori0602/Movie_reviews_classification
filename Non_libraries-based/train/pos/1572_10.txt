when reading a review from another user  saying that it s a terrible game  i could not stand idle and do nothing   well  this game is great  from the news clips  with two real persons  full of humour sense and credibility  to the story  i find it very good  i only complain about the enemies start blinking when they die  until they disappear  and some frustrating situations on the leila vr missions  when riding the bike  here and there   except that  it s a great game  with a great story  good graphics  excellent characters  great soundtrack  i recommend it  surely  it can be a bit old  but still enjoyable  at least  on the dreamcast  but the ps  version shall be the same
