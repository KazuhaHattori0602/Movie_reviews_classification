zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats  i don t typically go for military war movies  but this was worth my time   it was serious  but it was also humorous  beringer s character proved to be heroic and honest  no matter what  you know that he s got your back   zane s character developed throughout the film  he wasn t just a suit  he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun   the ending through me a little though  it didn t really go with the action throughout the film  but i m glad that i saw it  nonetheless   it s worth checking out
