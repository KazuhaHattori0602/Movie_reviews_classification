it s only   episodes into a   part drama  but i can already state that this is one of the best things i ve ever seen  that s on tv  silver screen or even in real life   as a writer  it s so good it s almost demoralising  as a viewer it s so entertaining that i m annoyed the episodes are over a fortnight instead of monday to friday  it s clear that all these negatives are actually positives   i m a modern guy who previously turned over from tv dramas  in comparison to movies  tv dramas always seemed to be dated  quite tame  and well  generally boring   five days  has really brought tv drama into the  st century  so for me at least  it s mind changing  go watch it
