farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful   drama  where she plays marjorie  a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would be rapist  well done to farrah for being a golden globe  best actress  nominee   when her rapist joe  terrifically played by james russo  comes into her home  which she shares with her two roommates  who are conveniently out  marjorie has to play along with joe s frightening demands  it does make for some disturbing and shocking images   when her roommates come home  they are astounded  to say the least  by marjorie s actions  and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police  makes the film even more nail biting   i do find diana scarwid quite irritating  but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all  it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed   overall  extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now  well done to everybody involved
