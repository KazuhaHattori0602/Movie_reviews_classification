my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times  i can t imagine how it could be better  this isn t the  complete  history of wwii no library could hold such a history but it is the best summary of that history  lots of detail  lots of personal stories  and still keeps the overall picture in view   olivier s narration is excellently written and  of course  superbly given  the interviews are from all sides  except the russian  because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians  it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd  we treasure our copy   the producer s do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive  there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles  for instance  but still  the episode on this subject is very well done
