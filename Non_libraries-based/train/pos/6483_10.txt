this excellent series  narrated by laurence olivier  brilliantly  it should be said  charts the beginning to the end of world war   the origins are not entirely examined fully from germany s fall at the hands of the versailles treaty which helped propel hitler s demonic rise  but as one reviewer says  that must be hard to do  in a  part series with so much to cram in    apart from the expected combat photography action  there are plenty of personal  emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight  especially if you re not necessarily a world war   buff fan  episodes showing  testimonies  and what life was like on the home front of the main allies adversary  britain  germany  japan  russia and the u s a  were quite eye opening  showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians  the death camps etc  were very well handled and exposed  i d fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation  of which it could be said i am one at    certain things are quite strangely left out  like the advent of the new jet era beginning  with frank whittle s experimental gloster jet and the gloster meteor s combat debut as well as that of the german messerschmitt me     especially as the v  was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the v  this is probably a small oversight  not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which ww  brought forward from a more barren old science  but a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated    a series to own as a box set in history terms  on dvd for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan  jeremy isaacs and thames tv should be well proud
