it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest  if any  without his presence   despite a not outstanding direction   in fact  there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly   a seemingly low budget  a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points  the presence of pierre fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible end   i have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance  even paul scofield acting in  a man for all seasons   actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to church by performing a crime    je suis maurice morand  pr tre catholique   i am maurice morand  a catholic priest is said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that end   the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich morand   who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest   consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into christ s blood   g rard   the man that wants to return morand to the church or replace him by himself   has to drink it if he doesn t want to leave it in the cabaret  he does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vine   in next scene  the dialoque between morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable   do you carry away men too  asks morand  who hates himself for what he has just done   that would be too much work  is the smart answer   the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the time   i think that  le d froqu  is a very strange film  but has to be seen by all viewers   if the are good catholiques it is mandatory   because it is a very rare jewell in film history
