some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the  s  but although it is undoubtedly brutal  violent and very downbeat  this film from pou soi cheang isn t really sleazy  lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison  however  it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch  particularly if gritty  hard edged action is your thing   edison chen plays pang  a cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge  sam lee is wai  the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down  whatever the cost  with wai closing in on his target  pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape until he meets yue  a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse   a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography  amazing sound design  a haunting score  and solid performances from chen and lee  as well as newcomer pei pei as pang s love interest  dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence  think along the lines of chan wook park s vengeance trilogy  stabbings  shootings  merciless beatings  all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang   of course  this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved  and sure enough  pretty much everyone in this film dies  rather nasty deaths  unfortunately  there is a fine line between tragedy and  unintentional  comedy  and in its final moments  dog bite dog crosses it  in a laughably over dramatic final scene  pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on  eventually  after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas  a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on  a now dead  yue  delivering their baby moments before he himself dies   whilst this film might not be a  classic  slice of hong kong excess  with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals  it s still worth seeking out
