and i gave it a high    why  because it bloody well rocked  at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories  as others have said here it was ahead of its time    sadly this is why the show was doomed  they have released   dvds with   episodes of the series so far  i am hoping that more come out    how does this compare watching it now   years after it first came out  i don t know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation  and that imho is it s only flaw  the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition    i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order  the dvds are good but i don t think the stories are in their proper order  but despite this the show rocked
