since the advent of literature  people of all nationalities have been fascinated and easily touched by accounts of unhappy love  even more fascinating have always been the tales of impossible love  love that cannot be  the israeli filmmaker eytan fox  latest film  the bubble  is about that  and then it is also not  the title of the film refers to the  bubble  that is tel aviv set against the background of the political realities of israel  the country s cosmopolitan and unofficial capital city doesn t have much in common with nablus  a city in the palestinian west bank which also features in the film  it doesn t have much in common with the tense and hateful atmosphere at the palestinian checkpoints  actually  it doesn t seem to have much in common with anything surrounding it  the  bubble  of tel aviv allows people to have a lifestyle which isn t much different from what you may expect in any western city  teenage girls looking for britney spears  records  a lifestyle magazine editor looking for a sexy cover for his next issue  trendy people sitting in trendy cafes discussing trendy things over cups of cappuccino and other similarly trendy drinks  while those at home are watching the local edition of pop idol  it is this  bubble  that also has the potential to lull one s mind into a false sense of reality   the film evolves around the lives of three young israelis who share a flat and  for the most part  try to stay out of politics  yelli  the camp owner and manager of  orna   ella  a hip cafe  rarely leaves the city and prefers not to think about the  crap that surrounds them  noam  a soft and easygoing employee of a slightly avantguard record store  seems to be equally unwilling to engage in long political discussions and contemplations  lulu  the only female of the lot  is on the contrary linked to the israeli left  although her political activities seem to be confined to  raves against the occupation  yelli and noam naturally don t object to participating in these  lulu and her political friends make t shirts with the rave s logo  put up posters and hand out booklets advertising it in the neighbourhood  their main concern seems to be that there are never any actual palestinians participating and that the police might come and spoil all the fun for them again  the closest they come to an actual confrontation is when they get into a scuffle with some not so palestinian friendly locals who try to prevent them from handing out the leaflets  in other words  predictable products of the  bubble   the opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to nablus where we also find noam doing his reserve duty  a group of palestinians is being thoroughly checked before entering israel  among them a pregnant woman who suddenly goes into labour and gives birth to a stillborn child despite the best efforts from noam and the doctor who eventually arrives in an ambulance  the woman is comforted by a young man who later turns up on noam s doorstep in tel aviv with his id which the latter obviously dropped during the ordeal on the border  his name is ashraf  he s palestinian and he s gay  and he hasn t just come to hand back the id  he has come to see noam  without a permit to live in israel and despite the initial hesitation from noam s flatmates he stays  he soon gets a jewish name and a job at yelli s cafe  having grown up in jerusalem with hebrew  he doesn t have an arabic accent which makes it possible for him and his newly found friends to conceal his identity  the sky is light blue and the air is sweet  but it cannot last  for he has become part of an equation which was never meant to be   at one point  noam and ashraf watch a play called bent about two prisoners in a nazi concentration camp who have a love relationship which can never become physical or visible to the surrounding guards  they find a way of being together on another level  a metaphysical one  a level where no one else has access  this is also where our couple arrives in the end  and it couldn t have been much different for them  not in today s israel    the bubble  is a political statement about the bubble that bursts when confronted with the political realities of today s israel set against the background of a beautiful and awkward love story involving an israeli and a palestinian  the impossible love story in a divided world where no such things as compromise or other colours than black and white exist   the bubble  is also a beautiful film about people  gay and straight  inhabiting that strange city  tel aviv  shown through the eyes of people who really care about them  the film s premise may have its flaws and the fatal chain of events may seem somewhat construed  but its strong message and emotional impact will not leave you untouched
