good luck finding this film to even watch   it s not yet released on tape or dvd  i saw on release in the early  s  was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheque s preservation efforts  and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years   no reason to repeat rwint s accurate comments here  as a come out director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces  jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible  and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re cutting  but it s also a memorable icon for it s time  the all very intense clashes of late  s college sports  student movements  sexual revolution  and more    why see this film  it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes  the frisky male bonding in the after game showers  karen black s scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard   but it s the first use of a word i hadn t witnessed in film before  and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall  there are probably others i m omitting   look for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films  a thin david ogend stiers  mike warren fresh out of his powder blue ucla uniform and readying for a dark blue tv uniform  robert towne   actor  and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves   now  any connection between harry gittes last name  robert towne  and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakes   it gets a   based on karen black  you ll see why
