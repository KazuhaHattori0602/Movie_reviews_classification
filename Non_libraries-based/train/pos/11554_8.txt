i don t think i ve really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer  he s certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles  but i guess i always put his success down to his characters  grumpiness and ruthlessness  a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star jack lemmon  and  i suppose  a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures  watching gene saks   the odd couple   adapted from a popular neil simon play  the realisation suddenly clicked  matthau is  in his own right  absolutely hilarious  initially striking the audience as filthy  crude and generally unappealing  his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts  culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own  at the same time  while holding his own as a comedian  his interplay with lemmon is  of course  pitch perfect  indeed  the film rightly belongs to both actors  who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves  let alone together   calling to mind billy wilder s screenplay for  the apartment   this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise  compulsive house cleaner felix unger  lemmon  having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years  attempts to commit suicide  but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window  dejected  he arrives at the house of good friend oscar  matthau  a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches  that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat  oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay  but is soon overwhelmed by his friend s finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness  the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement  with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife  and oscar as the sloppy  unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he s supposed to  this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks  and  by the end of it  we can completely sympathise with felix s ex wife  who remains unseen    the odd couple  is a terrific comedy  most of all because it has a lot of heart  for all their arguing  it s obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other  most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade  instead   perhaps inadvertently   ending up informing oscar how  tops  he his  the pair s four poker buddies  john fiedler  herb edelman  david sheiner and larry haines  are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance  but you can t deny that they ve got the best of intentions  their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory  but maybe being ignored wasn t quite the correct solution to felix s gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality  unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays  i was recently disappointed by wilder s  the seven year itch   this film doesn t simply strike at the same chord throughout  and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed  through tears  laughter and much disagreement
