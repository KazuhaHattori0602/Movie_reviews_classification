i must have seen this a dozen times over the years  i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b   w on the local pbs station   i bought a dvd set for the children to see  and am making them watch it  they don t teach history in school  and this explains the most critical event of the  th century  it expands their critical thinking   impartially  with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why  it details what lead up to the war and the actual war   buy it for your children  along with alistair cooke s america  watch it with them  and make them understand  you ll be so glad you did
