okay  i am a fan of the nightmare series and everyone says on here that this is the worst  but it s not  haven t s you seen freddy s revenge  wtf  that was the worst of all  now this movie is pretty decent and it sticks to the freddy story and it s cool that he had a daughter etc  etc   and then i found out it was in  d  i was so excited  i remember when i saw it on the dvd box set i instantly skipped to the  d sequences  quite a lot was in  d though like lisa zanes hand  dream demons  freddy s claw  more than once  lezlie dean holding a knife  lisa zane with a baseball bat  doc s hand  freddy s head exploding   i truly loved this movie because it was in  d  but i wish the whole movie was in  d not just the last   minutes   by the way it s   minutes not ten
