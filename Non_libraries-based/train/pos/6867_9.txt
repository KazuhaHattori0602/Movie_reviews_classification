i was born in   most of my childhood memories are in the extreme late  s and  s  i watched the groove tube for the first time in   when i was    and i found it hilarious   so for anybody who thinks that something  dated  can t be quite funny   years later think again  it s funny even if you have no idea what the  s were like  and the thought of bell bottom pants make you cringe  who can argue with a bozo the clown type who reads adult literature  there is plenty to laugh at  the scrotal puppet show at the end is the best
