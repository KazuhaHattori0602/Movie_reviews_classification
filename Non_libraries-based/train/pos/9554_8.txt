lock up your daughters is one of the best high spirited comedies i have ever seen   it is misunderstood since it lacks the  social commentary  values that many films of the day   required to be successful   the characters are over the top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors   christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington  a noble with hair too big to fit in the door   the plot involves the usual  th century stuff  mistaken identities  thwarted romances  corrupt government officials  and jokes at every turn   it answers the questions  what happens when   rambunctious  eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town  and  who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out   despite doing poorly at the box office  it has great costumes  excellent music based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name  great lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic   that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame  since so many bad movies are released every day
