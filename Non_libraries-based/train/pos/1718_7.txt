this period melodrama is one of griffith s earliest claustrophobic films  characters trapped within a room are prevalent throughout his work and  as time went by  he would become increasingly adept at portraying their helplessness and involving the audience in their terror  in the bluntly titled sealed room there is one major difference to the normal plot line  in that there truly is no escape   griffith achieves the claustrophobic effect here in two ways  first is his use of space  while the typical biograph short might utilise a dozen or more sets  the sealed room features only two adjoining rooms   the king s court and the dove cote that becomes the eponymous tomb  the set design in these shorts is rarely referenced  but here it is crucial  the court is a large interior  with a backdrop hinting at greater depth and showing us a window and a staircase  actors enter and leave from various directions  suggesting the room is not only spacious but also free and open  by contrast the dove cote s back wall is very close to the camera  and the angles in it suggesting a hexagonal or octagonal shape make it seem even more confined   the second technique on display here is the cross cutting  anyone with an interest in griffith s work will probably know about his heavy use and development of cross cutting to build excitement or tension  many will also know that strictly speaking it wasn t his invention  however what makes griffith s cross cuts so effective is the way he paces the opposing images so they complement each other  the sealed room contains a good example of what i mean  the shots of the masons shifting the heavy bricks have a slow  step by step pace to them  with tension building as the wall gets higher  this movement is matched by the shots of the blissfully unaware lovers  in which marion leonard tears off flower petals one by one  as the couple realise their predicament  their rising panic is complemented by the opposing shot of the king madly thrashing his sword against the wall   at this point  griffith was yet to realise that the action could be heightened further by introducing a third strand to the cross cut  the dramatic  ride to the rescue  here absent  was later to become a standard climax to griffith s pictures
