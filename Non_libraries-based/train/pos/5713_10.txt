   please note that they were wrong in one important respect  not every line in the film is sung  in fact  it contains no more songs than a regular musical  it is actually a lot more like a chaplin or buster keaton or marx brothers film  my criticisms of the disc are not that important  heck  criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints  the fact is  their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only    now   people have voted for on imdb  and only about a hundred people  if that  will ever see the film  heck  if you look at the criterion web site  le million is nowhere to be found  i have no clue why not  it s something they should really be proud of  of course  their web site is surprisingly horrible  they did a fine job on this film  bravo  they deserve all the money i can stand to give them
