i have looked forward to seeing this since i first saw it listed in her work  finally found it yesterday   on lifetime movie channel   jim larson s comments about it being a  sweet funny story of   people crossing paths  were dead on  writers probably shouldn t get a bonus  everyone else sro for making the movie   anybody who appreciates a romantic movie should see it   natasha s screen presence is so warm and her smile so electric  to say nothing of her beauty  that anything she is in goes on my favorite list  her tv and print interviews that i have seen are just as refreshing and well worth looking for   god bless her  her family and future endeavors   this movie doesn t seem to available in dvd or video yet  but i would be the first to buy it and i think others would too
