  about it being  hammy acting  quite perplexing   i found every aspect of paperhouse to be exhilarating  even in minor scenes of brilliance like when charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door  it s quite powerful   you don t have to be an arthouse type to enjoy paperhouse  just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more  there is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and i m still in awe of the cinematography and sets  for me  it s never like watching the same film twice  as there are so many details to absorb and savor  a very emotional experience indeed   while there are many films i adore  there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me  films like paperhouse  static  resurrection  and donnie darko  when i see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins  all i have to do is watch paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed
