idiotic hack crooks  a babe  a safe  a plan and a baby  add them all up and you get the best comedy you ve never heard of    even with some a list star power  at least a minus okay  b plus  this movie got very little publicity   but that does not diminish its genius   terrific writing  solid delivery and a believable group of characters  some truly classic lines  and a fun twist at the end   this is not some watered down  nutty professor  comedy  these are low life bad guys  they speak low life bad guy language and they do low life bad guy things  but they do it for your amusement and entertainment  and they do that well   one of the best comedies i ve ever seen
