i entered my first comment on this film almost five years ago  then  the ideas presented in the movie still seemed mostly fictional  if indeed they could ever transpire at all  not any longer  now  the politics  society  and media in the running man seem very close to home indeed   consider the following factors  which were mostly absent in    the year the running man came out  that are present today   concern with  as richard dawson s character damon killian puts it   traditional morality  check  entertainment in the form of extreme reality  including pain  fear  and discomfort on the part of contestants  check  cameras everywhere  check  restricted travel for citizens at the whim of the government  controlled by a centralized computer system complete with barcoded passports  travel passes  in the movie  and sanctioned under the guise of national security  check  an increased intermingling  bordering on incestuous  of government and media  check  computer generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real film footage  such as the  digital matting  of ben richards  image onto the stunt double  check  jailing of conscientious objectors or detractors of the current administration  check  flagging economy further widening the gulf between the wealthy and not so wealthy  increasing numbers of fringe groups reacting to the tightening noose of big government  civil unrest brewing just under or at the surface of nearly every sizable public event regardless of its origin or intent  check  check  check  then again  maybe it s just a movie based on a stephen king novella  but just to be safe  i m moving to switzerland
