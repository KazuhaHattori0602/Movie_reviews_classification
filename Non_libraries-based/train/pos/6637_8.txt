story says that on that on december     a small group of thirty three people was gathered at paris s salon indien du grand caf  to witness the cin matographe  a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named august and louis lumi re  the small audience reunited that day  some by invitation  most due to curiosity  didn t really know what to expect from the show  and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen  most thought that the cin matographe was just another fancy devise to present slide show projections  until the photograph started to move  what those thirty three people experienced in awe that cold day of december was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen  history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day   of the   short movies that were shown during that historic day   la sortie des usines lumi re   literally  exiting the lumi re factory  was the very first to be screened  the film shows the many workers of the lumi re factory as they walk through the gates of the factory  leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work  while a very basic  actuality film   movie depicting a real event  the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise  as their concept of moving pictures was limited to edison s  peep show  machines  the kinetoscope  the brothers  invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe  as the people and the horses moved across the screen  the idea wasn t entirely new  le prince shot the first movie as early as   but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary    la sortie des usines lumi re  would become the first in the long series of  actuality films  that the lumi re would produce over the years  this primitive form of documentary was the brothers  favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the cin matographe could have  despite the initial lack of enthusiasm  after the first showing the cin matographe became a great success and  la sortie des usines lumi re  quickly became an iconic image of that first screening  it definitely wasn t the first movie the brothers shot that year  and it probably wasn t the best of the   movies shown that day  personally i think that  l  arroseur arros  was the best of the   however  it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates  as literally  this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it
