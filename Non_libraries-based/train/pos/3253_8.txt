not a film to be taken seriously  but a great little film nonetheless   it s definitely not just a piece of fluff  the acting  imo  is excellent   one of those films you wouldn t go out of your way to see  but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable  like an old friend   definitely worth seeing if you get the chance
