first off  consider that this film is nearly fifty years old  yet  it still stands up as one of the great films of all time  i wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in    the story is simple  yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day  i can still recall the first time i watched this  as a kid  when the monster enters the force field protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first  and only  time  had me shivering in fear  i can tell you  looks dated today  but still more than effective enough   the scenes with the tiger show their age now  you can see the outline where the tiger was matted into the shots with altaira  but they are only just visible   likewise  the effect whereby the creature melts its way through the krell doors are wonderfully done   it s also amazing to see leslie nielsen  better remembered for the airplane and naked gun movies  as a young  but still mature man  he was   when this film came out  nearly   now   all in all a good movie that is sure to continue being a favourite for years to come  timeless
