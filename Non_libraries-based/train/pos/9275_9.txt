panahi  whose previous films such as the circle and crimson gold have seemed to range from dour to grim  has produced in his new offside a funny  obstreperous  joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun   yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he s done  by focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre world cup bahrain iran match in tehran stadium  panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent mindedness  and the contradictions   and sheer absurdity   of the regime s religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves   as the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus  with a father pursing a lost daughter  this one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint  but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what s going to happen  she s still easily spotted  the thing is  most of the men around don t really care  still  rules are rules  and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would be soccer girls  or some of them anyway  get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young  green  and rustic soldier cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls  independent ideas and would rather be watching the game   whose roar we constantly hear in the background   themselves  each girl is different   represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it  one wore a soldier s uniform and got into the officers  section  one is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative  she could pass for a pretty boy  and teasingly hints at that   are you a girl or a boy   which would you like me to be  one doesn t care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade  one  aida sadeghi  is an ardent soccer player herself   and so on  these tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them  safar samandar  one of the rural cops  mohamad kheirabadi  takes the girl soccer player to the men s restroom  of course there s no ladies  forcing her to wear a poster of an italian football star as a mask  a comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes   later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the vice department   violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice  a male gets mixed in with them   a kid who s chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games  the van turns out not to be so spiffy  the radio aerial is broken  but one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart stopping reportage  cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now  there s no score  the game goes to penalty kicks  and the winner will go to germany   in the background through all this is a real game  a real stadium  and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event  the excitement is tremendous  and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an iranian win and united in their excitement   what makes this film so good  as may be clear by now  is that it s shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around  this  in contrast to panahi s previous highly calculated narrative trajectories  is spontaneous v rit  film making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling   the essence of offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro islamic social prohibitions repressing women   the latter existing at a time when young iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit  how exactly do you reconcile the country s ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval  a lot of offisde is astonishingly real  including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything  the director s decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary  polemic  and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick  and that ends in a way that s brilliant and moving   i ve had reservations about panahi s films before  but this one kicks ass  panahi does something remarkable here  he critiques his society  presents an unusual drama  and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation s aspirations
