i rented domino on a whim  not even knowing it was inspired by a true story  and even though it s the least likely and true biopic you ll probably see  i found it to be rather awesome   with richard kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into   hours of pure entertainment  and once you ve seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it    domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career  it has an edgy acid trip style provided by director tony scott  and with fast paced music and editing  it provides the visual flare to keep your attention  with slick performances and unexpected comedy  the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience    i suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for   hours
