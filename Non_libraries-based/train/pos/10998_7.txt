it s actually a good thing sean connery retired as james bond  as i m sure he wouldn t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying business  where fast cars have been replaced with hi tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment   cypher  is a pretty inventive sci fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright   claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible  you know the trend in these types of movies  nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot  the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again  the events in  cypher  supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world  where the major companies don t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other s thunder  company digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity  only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor  the sunways corporation  sunways  on the other hand  constantly tries to unmask the digisoft rats and recruit them again as double spies  in between this whole unprofitable business stands morgan sullivan  a seemingly colorless thirty something employee who s been selected by sebastian rooks  the  ber spy  to diddle the secret policies of both companies  trust me  it s actually less complicated than it sounds and director vincenzo natali  the dude from  tube  carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters  the first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated john frankenheimer gem  seconds    starring rock hudson   as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style  even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that  s film  with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless  there s also plenty of great action and suspense  most notably when morgan soberly experiences how the digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing techniques during boring conventions  the middle section of the film drags a little  mainly because you already realize that it s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot twists  and i hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not so distant future  jeremy northam is perfectly cast and the adorable lucy liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side  regular director s choice david hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric suways engineer virgil c  dunn   cypher  is well made and adrenalin rushing sci fi entertainment  highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time
