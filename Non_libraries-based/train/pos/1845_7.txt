why this is called  mistresses  is a puzzle  because it s about four women  three of whom aren t mistresses
 except  wait  ah  i see  it s a salacious title and we all have to merchandise i suppose  the series itself  delicious  most of the characters are hell bent on cutting metaphorical chunks off themselves  great fun  reminds me of lwt s   miniseries  bouquet of barbed wire  where every character and their dads wielded the machete   siobhan  orla brady  is the only actual mistress and she s getting herself in proper trouble  husband is infertile  so no chance of a baby there then  but at work  there s dominic  played by uber sexy adam rayner  who looks so good that there s no surprise when heavy lust breaks out  dominic  it turns out  has no fertility problems  i expect his sperms do swashbuckling   probably each carries a little sword   and now siobhan is inevitably pregnant that way instead  what siobhan should do is to shut up good and tight  and go with   it s a miracle  what she actually does of course is say to her friends  i have to tell my husband  no you don t  really  you don t  stop  stop   katie  sarah parish  was a mistress once  for we learn that she d had an affair with a married man before the series started  unwisely  she s now taken up with his son  the father died of cancer and katie  who is a doctor  helped him on his journey  so  she s an euthanasiarist  has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in carelessly ignoring the incestuous undertones  it s not going to end well for katie   jessica is an experimental lesbian  she arranges events and she s busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets underway  she quickly gets into steamy eye exchanges with one of the brides alex  played by anna torv  and the script hurries along to a lesbonk with great haste  however  it can t think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together  so it invents a very lame  you re not having a hen night  well i can t let you get away with that  i ll organise one and the guests shall be   me  which achieves the result but isn t exactly winterson  i thought script writers were supposed to earn their living  lazy  torv s interpretation of her character is good  alex treats jessica as possibly unsavoury and alex s body language always points backwards when she s moving forward  mind  once she s over the wall  in she happily goes  and unsurprisingly  for shelley conn is so mouth watering that so would a good percentage of the human race given the chance   which brings us to trudi  who s a widow  of course there should be plain people in a community but  if you re going to have a plain character  then you have to invent something to admire in them  it s quite possible to be a lump and engaging  however  small s trudi looks like one of those characters that casting put prominently in a medieval crowd scene after the director said  that s ridiculous  not every single character would be pretty  more tellingly  you can t find anything to admire in her  nothing  she s a turnip in a bowl of apples  appallingly  she does  sexy  from time to time  i won t forget her appearance in bright red corset with stockings tucked into her crotch for a long time  and for all the wrong reasons   so  good  delinquent fun all round  there s easily enough material here for a second series and i hope that they do one  i trust they learn one lesson though  the characters never take off their underclothes in bed  having spent abandoned hours of unbridled lust  afterwards they surface still wearing their bras  or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits  after several episodes  no nipples yet and you can go beg for a cock  what s this  early  st century puritanism  so production team  are you listening  your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they do abandon as well as talk it  at least they ll have more fun in the fun scenes  poor things  in a series dominated by either being in the bedroom  or wanted to be in the bedroom  or having just been in the bedroom  it s a bit silly  and jars a lot  that the characters bonk in their underwear   overall  i was going to score    top end medium  but the series does one trick that s rare enough  when each episode ends  you always want more  and you look forward to the next one with anticipation  so i score
