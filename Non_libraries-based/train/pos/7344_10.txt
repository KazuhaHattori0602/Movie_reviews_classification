in my opinion  this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short   years earlier  i doubt it would benefit from modern technologies  but it would have looked much better if it was at least   minutes instead of    the artists and animated did a great job  in my opinion  this movie can boast the best background art and one of the best character design  animation are extremely smooth and realistic  for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see  so everyone did a great job  it can also boast one of the sexiest female animated characters  if not the sexiest  that beets typical anime girls with ease   unfortunately  there are a couple of bad thins about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment  first  the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies  and is really old fashioned by modern standards  second  due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra   minutes of dialogs  finally  the setting is not so popular at the moment   conclusion  a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian  but not to a novel
