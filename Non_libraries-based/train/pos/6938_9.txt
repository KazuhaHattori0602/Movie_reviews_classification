for the viewer who comes upon it long after its making   winchester   has something in common with  casablanca  while you watch it  you get this feeling that you re looking at a string of clich s encountered so often in the genre  then you realise that the clich s became clich s only after being copied from this particular film  and that they were so widely copied because this film was so great  in other words  it s a seminal work    winchester   is a joy to watch  the broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable  but mostly because you ve seen them copied so many times in later movies  and nevertheless it still contains a number of twists which surprise you  the dialogue  the pacing and mann s direction are excellent  stewart shines in particular  and if you re a fan this is a  must see  but he is not alone in delivering a good performance  remarkably  many of the most thoughtful and or witty lines go to minor characters  because this makes these characters  much  more than cardboard cutouts  it lent additional realism to the film    this is a remarkably underrated film  and well worth keeping an eye out for  the dvd also contains an interview with stewart which provides some background on the film
