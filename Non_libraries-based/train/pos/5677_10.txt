the  rd and in my view the best of the blackadder series   the only downside is that there is no lord percy who was the funniest character from the previous series but hugh laurie s prince regent is suitably madcap laugh a line   as a package it s quality through and through with convincing regency sets  superb cutting sarcasm and little bits of the wacky  the  macbeth  actors standing out and prince georges  lucky us  chicken impression  and the missing words from dr johnson s dictionary   few comedies have been quite as both clever as they are funny  okay the odd lame observation or line gets in but mostly it s a scream
