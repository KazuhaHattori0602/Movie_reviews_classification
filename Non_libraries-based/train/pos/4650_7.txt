as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp    mbb bo   flight scenes in this movie  one of the few disappointments was the ews   jammer pod  in this case an inert rb    maverick  missile painted black with the letters  ews   in white along the side  real jammer pods definitely do not look like that  at least not the ones i ve seen   but apart from that  it s an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending  the last minute  anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units  including the now legendary ssg  on film should see this one
