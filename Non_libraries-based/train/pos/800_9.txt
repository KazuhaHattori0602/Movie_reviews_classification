i couldn t have been more thrilled  just eight years old back in   i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater  the best day of my life was about to happen  to that time  my only star wars experience had been a few hbo showings of star wars  i hadn t even seen the empire strikes back yet   and boy  did that day deliver for my less critical eyes  jabba  big rebel spaceships  the emporer  a green bladed lightsaber  wow  since that magical day  i must have watched this movie hundreds of times  i can t even form an accurate estimate at this point  with those multiple viewings  i have of course observed that this movie   the real episode iii   does have its flaws   of course in the context of a star wars movie  those  flaws  are more like  quirks   millions had had their magical day in   and   in may of   i had mine  and this was my star wars movie
