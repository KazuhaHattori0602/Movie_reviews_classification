greetings again from the darkness    directors of   seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights  a very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer  we are so accustomed to character development over a   hour movie  it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an   minute segment   the idea is   love relationship stories in   different neighborhoods of this magnificent city  of course  some stand up better than others and some go for comedy  while others focus on dramatic emotion  some very known directors are involved  including  the coen brothers  wes craven  alfonso cuaron  alexander payne  gus van sant and gurinda chadha  many familiar faces make appearances as well  steve buscemi  barbet schroeder  catalina sandino moreno  ben gazzara  gena rowlands  gerard depardieu  juliette binoche  willem dafoe  nick nolte  maggie gyllenhaal and bob hoskins   one of the best segments involves a mime  and then another mime and the nerdy  yet happy young son of the two mimes  also playing key roles are a red trench coat  cancer  divorce  sexual fantasy  the death of a child and many other topics  don t miss alexander payne  director of  sideways  as oscar wilde   the diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch  but as a film  it cannot be termed great  still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer
