not as bad a film as i thought it would be   it has a good cast nice to see roger moore back on screen as well as the use of other british actors   would like to see more of olivia d`abo in future projects maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy maryam d`abo   also a good use of unseen locations such as luxembourg   hopefully we will see more uk european co productions like this
