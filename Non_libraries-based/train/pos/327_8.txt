i ve read one comment which labeled this film  trash  and  a waste  of time  i think this person got their political undies tugged a bit  too much   i just rented the new criterion dvd s of both yellow and blue   these films although hardly great have at least become of  historical interest as to the so called  radical student  political social movement of the late  s   i hadn t seen either picture and from their notorious reputation  i  was expecting some real porn  there isn t any  there is frontal  nudity  including the still verboten frontal male nudity  automatic  nc the orwellian x  in the u s  but i wasn t expecting the films  in your face democratic socialist message    though it tends to the simplistic   i thought it occassionally made  its points well  both films occassionally had me laughing out loud  and the director s commentary made it clear there was plenty of  parody in the film  especially the supposedly  pornographic  sex  scenes  the first such scene is very realistic  the lead couple is  clumsy  inept  funny and endearing in their first copulation scene   the second which caused the most complaints has faked  cunnilingus and fellatio  and the last is the end of an angry fight   that is believable   the extras include an informative introduction to the film  an  interview with the original american distributor and his attorney   excerpts from trial testimony in the u s  and a  diary  commentary  by the director on some scenes   this is the film that  blue noses  wouldn t let alone and led to the  pivotal  prurient interest with no social redeeming value  standard  that  thankfully  still stands   those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must  see
