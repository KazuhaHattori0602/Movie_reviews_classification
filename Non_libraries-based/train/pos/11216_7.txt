the story is extremely unique it s about these   pilots saving earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly the whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time friends and mentors   the ending could have been fantastic it started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy disney note and annoyed me very bad   the animation is decent for   but can t compare to nowadays i have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity i actually found it to be somewhat decent the nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode   where there was an excess   overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
