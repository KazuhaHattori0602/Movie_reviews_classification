the cult movie for every true russian intellectual  everything is brilliant  especially acting  it s beyond any praise  the movie  as the book  is full of symbols  my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha  colloquial russian word for  devastation  often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the   civil war    the wide opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch black hole of the doorway behind it   now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the   sound  there are well translated english subtitles too  though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation  i don t know is that dvd available abroad but if you ll find it grab it immediately  it s really worthy of watching   and  in conclusion  a fact  about the   of russians today  mostly youth  can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree  it s the post soviet effect  soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization  tv producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive  soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian  even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it s amazingly common in colloquial speech
