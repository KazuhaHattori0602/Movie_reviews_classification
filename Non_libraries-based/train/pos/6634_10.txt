how can t you rate this movie with   i admit to say that this movie is not very entertaining but the goal is not to tell you a story but history  this is the first `real  movie of cinema history  `le prince de galles  was first but it was not technically perfect enough
  and it has an undoubtedly huge international value  these people that you can see finishing their working day in the movie had the chance to participate to a historic moment  becoming the first persons to be able to see themselves moving  and above all the shot is a beautiful shot  and it s very moving when you think about the first persons to have seen that  what a moment  historic for science first  because the lumiere brothers first invented the cinematographe for scientific reasons  and for art later  a movie to venerate
