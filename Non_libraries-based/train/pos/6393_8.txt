this is a must see for independant movie fans  but it also holds up well against mainstream movies  i think we have the makings of the next woody allen or  trentin tarrentino here   the budget is painfully low  no special effects whatsoever  and they seemingly used ambient lighting  shot in digital video   and yet this movie grabs hold of you and never lets go  the screenplay is somewhat bizarre  yet the actors and director pull it off with complete realism  it has humor  it has intrigue  and it has pathos  and it all works together   no point in describing the details  if you want to see an independant  masterpiece  a virtual lesson in how to make a low budget flick that really works  see this one    oh yeah  it s also really entertaining
