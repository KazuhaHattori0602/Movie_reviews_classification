disney  the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages  has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse  such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years  films like  tarzan  and  the emperor s new groove  have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song driven routine of disney s past and into new  uncharted territory   atlantis  is the boldest step yet  but we have to remember  this is still disney  the first ever serious film to come out of disney s animation studio is a major achievement for them   in fact it s so serious it makes it into pg territory  perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer   but despite the more mature subject matter  this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with  not just mature audiences  so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand  but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of  the little mermaid  et al   so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot  unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a  minute movie  ultimately  this is an action film about atlantis  not about the exposition preceding it  so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency  suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly  you re unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood  if you want epic levels of detail in the plot  turn to james cameron s  titanic  both films feature a boat in some manner   and let s talk about love  shall we  yes  as with a lot of films  the lead male  one milo thatch  a bumbling archaeologist  and lead female  kida  the clich d atlantian princess  are set to fall in love with each other  but what i found was not as clich d as i was expecting  by film s end  for once  the characters touching feeling kissing sequence was far more subdued  there s various points in the film where the attraction grows  but it s just not in the ballpark of  say   the little mermaid   a good thing   you may have grasped that this is a rather clich d film  correct  you have your leading hero and heroine  backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition  all being given their moments during the film  numerous other characters appear  take up the few minutes of screentime  then disappear  it doesn t take a genius to do the maths   a  minute film with a focus on action and visuals  and with a considerable cast  has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent  so what does it rely on  clich s  and lots of them  every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before  you have the bumbling scientist  the attractive princess  the square jawed colonel  the rich eccentric  the maniacal sleazebag  the russian femme fatale   need i go on   i don t know why this got to anyone   i found the tongue in cheek nature of this film quite amusing  alright  this is meant to be a serious flick  but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history  at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue  and sometimes it even is a little inspired   but in the end it s those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake  the cgi animation is truly amazing in places  and doesn t dwarf the characters  which was a flaw that let the recent  titan a e  down  speaking of characters  disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs  bringing an anime style to the film  infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime  much more so than any previous disney outing  this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime   nadia  for the film s overall similarities with said cartoon series  having not seen this anime  i can t comment   with picture  there is sound  gary rydstrom heads up the sound team  and what a soundtrack  from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat  james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score  which compliments the film in every way  never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it   perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended  to me  the film conveys that it s an adventure thrill ride  albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it  if you don t like the clich d tongue in cheek attitude  then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight  heck  at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts  cough hercules cough   this is a positive    out of   review  from someone who was blown away by this film  i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film   after all  the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium  so sit back  enjoy the ride  and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film
