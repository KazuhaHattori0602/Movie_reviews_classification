it s hard for me to assign the  fair  number of stars to this film  but i settled on   because of its high production values and what was  in   an innovative approach to the war film  remember too that i haven t seen it since   but it did make a strong impression   the long day s dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made  it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in   no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail  and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves  there is no preaching  no sentimentality  no comic relief  no complicated scenarios   unfortunately  there s no subtlety either  partly because of their situation   trying to stay alive   the characters come across as flat  familiar clich s  as  entertainment  the film doesn t make it  though it was clearly not intended to  entertain  it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general  this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan  both of which are far more  watchable  films  here the flat and generally disagreeable characters  the lack of an actual plot  and the realistically unpleasant images  including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history  make the film hard to sit through  though it is only   minutes   so    stars for production and realism    stars for the feeling you ll have when it s over  a bonus star for having its heart in the right place  average     like carl foreman s underrated  the victors  an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film  the long day s dying seems not to be on dvd  why not  both films have been on cable a number of times
