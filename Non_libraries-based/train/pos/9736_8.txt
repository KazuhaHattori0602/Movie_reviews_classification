pegg has had a few hits in the past few years  starting with  shaun of the dead  in   movie on to  hot fuzz   early   he came out with  run fat boy run  and now comes this   how to lose friends and alienate people  which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy s of the year   the film is about sidney yound  a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity s mostly because he is not one of them  anyway  one of the most successful magazine owners  played by jeff bridges  invites him  out of nostalgia  to work at his magazine  sidney is of course excited and moves to america  there he meets a girl currently writing a book  and hilarity ensues   this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future  pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy  paul  i rate this film
