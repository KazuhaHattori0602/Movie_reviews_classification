star trek hidden frontier will surprise you in many ways  first  it s a fan made series  available only on the web  and it features mainly friends   neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to  as mickey   judy once put it  put on a show  it s definitely friends   neighbors to  you can tell  a lot of these people aren t the most beautiful looking folks you ve ever seen  or the youngest  or the thinnest
 some of them stumble through their lines like they re walking on marbles
 some of them have thick accents  or simply don t seem to speak well in the first place  whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they re saying  still  you have to admit  for everything these friends   neighbors have put together  it s actually fun to watch  yes  some of the dialogue is hokey  yes  it s a little odd  though admittedly a little cool too  watching two starfleet males kiss  although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on  yes  you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from st tos  tng  other shows and the movies  or when you hear the theme from galaxy quest played at the beginning and end of every show  okay  we can get by that  why  the graphics are first rate  better than almost anything you ve seen  and sometimes  a show or two really stands out story wise
 some of them are actually real tear jerkers   hidden frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word
 but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due  it takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude  people  sets  costumes  graphics
 it s a huge effort on a lot of people s parts  we watch  we return  and we thank them
