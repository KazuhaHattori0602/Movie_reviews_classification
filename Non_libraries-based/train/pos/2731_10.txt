sorry  i don t have much time to write  i am not a psychologist but have known one for   years  she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath  no conscience  extraordinarily well  i agree  she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn t control himself superbly  i agree  what a chilling and tremendous film  i have seen over   films and would rank this in the top   my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly  my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film  many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these   losers did
