set in the cameroons in west africa in the  s  claire denis  chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of french rule  the theme is similar to the recent nowhere in africa  though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis  the film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country  france dalens  mireille perrier  a young woman traveling through cameroon  recalls her childhood when her father  francois cluzet  was a government official in the french cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant  prot e  isaach de bankol  the heart of the film  however  revolves around france s mother aim e  giulia boschi  and her love hate relationship with prot e that is seething with unspoken sexual tension    the household is divided into public and private spaces  the white families rooms are private and off limits to all except prot e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors  exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family s gazes  it becomes clear when her husband marc  fran ois cluzet  goes away on business that aim e and prot e are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged  in one telling sequence  she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other s image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes  knowing that any interaction is taboo    the young france  cecile ducasse  also forms a bond with the manservant  feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky  in spite of their bond  the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when france commands prot e to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home  and when prot e stands beside her at the dinner table  waiting for her next command  when a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains  the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located  each visitor shows their disdain for the africans  one  a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room  another  luc  jean claude adelin  an arrogant white frenchman  upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower  eats with the servants  and taunts aim e about her attraction to prot e leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant   chocolat is loosely autobiographical  adapted from the childhood memories of the director  and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed  denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters  there are no victims or oppressors  no simplistic good guys  prot e is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where aim e and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena  it is a sad fact that prot e is treated as a boy and not as a man  but bankol  imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain  because of its pace  western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and denis does not  in roger ebert s phrase   coach our emotions  the truth of chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart
