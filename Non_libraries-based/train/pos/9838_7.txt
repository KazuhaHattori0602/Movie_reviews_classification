born again is a okay episode of season   the reincarnation bit  in my opinion  is cool  the more i watch it  the more i like it  yet it will never rise above  very good  for me  even though it is not very memorable  i ll always remember it as the reincarnation episode  anyway  now i will say what is good and bad about this episode   the good  oragami  oh yeah   that fish tank was nice   ]  thrown out of a window  very classy  x]  the bad  marry your best friend s wife  o_o  what a random pick to reincarnate   why didn t the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up  try to take his scarf off instead   conclusion  okay episode  not very memorable
