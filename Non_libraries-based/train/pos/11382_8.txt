what makes for best picture material  the oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly  and ignoring the  auteurs  who would be deified in decades to come  it wasn t because hollywood was against art or creativity  the academy awards are the selections made by the industry itself  and that is why  at least in the classic era  they tended to reward the greatest collaborations  the most sensational meetings of creative minds   the arthur freed unit at mgm had been bound for oscar winning glory for several years by this point  it was only a matter of time before freed  aided by his strongest director vincente minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business  would land a best picture  freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else  crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the  s musicals  the point about freed musicals  is that the lyrics of the songs  unlike those of hammerstein or lerner  don t have to tell or even relate to the stories  what s important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film   an american in paris was the first of three freed musicals  the other two being singin  in the rain and the band wagon  which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story  the words don t fit the plot  but the routines fit the show  so  when gene kelly sings i got rhythm  he hasn t even got a girl yet  but the way it s done with the french kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation  and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point  an american in paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story  such as the series of dances which accompany the description of leslie caron s character   and what better director for this project than minnelli  himself a painter and a pianist  at this time there wasn t really anyone who had a better feel for technicolor  while some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades  minnelli s colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced  in the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted  but not drab  and in particular there is an absence of red  during oscar levant and georges guetary s meeting in the caf  a few more vibrant shades are introduced  then  during the first musical number   by strauss  minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red   a table cloth  a bunch of roses   until it eventually dominates  as if the song has awoken the picture s colour scheme  for most of the songs  the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people  however  in some numbers  such as  tra la la  he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated   the achilles  heel of an american in paris is its story  i personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable  playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the  s  the headstrong  independent woman gets rejected while the meek  delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero  even if you don t mind that  it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances  compare this to singin  in the rain  which doesn t really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as an american in paris  but it has a winning storyline  singin  in the rain was overlooked at the   oscars  yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today  but i think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment  not just a means of telling a story  an american in paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but  like a certain demille picture that won the top award the following year  it certainly is a great show
