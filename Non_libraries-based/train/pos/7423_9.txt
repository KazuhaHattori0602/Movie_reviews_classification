i recently watched the   version of this film with judy  and while i appreciated the story and music  i found that the film failed to hold my attention  i expected the   remake to be the same story  except with a barbra twist  i was pleasantly surprised   it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame  money  love and the price of it all  this version is so much more real than the   one  with arguably better music  better acting  a more gripping plot line  and  of course  a deeper love  i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institute s top   list  while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic s list
