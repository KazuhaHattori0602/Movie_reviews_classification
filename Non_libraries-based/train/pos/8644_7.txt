    a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten      a classic in time  simply a must see      a solid  worth while  very entertaining piece      a good movie  but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws      may still be considered good in areas  but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable  e g  genre       mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments  bomb   not of a viewable quality    kalifornia        unrated  for strong violent material  considerable sexuality  and language   i rented this film expecting an in your face summer blockbuster quality celebration of brad pitt s face  but was happily surprised and disappointed  this really is more of a drama  and very grim at that  i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice overs   pitt plays out his possibly un sexiest film ever with startling talent  who started out as a hopeless yet harmless  white trash  husband became realized as a violent  disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind  during some of the latter stages in the film  i found it hard to keep watching him   he was unpredictable and scary  this proves very good writing and acting   the whole movie is filled with bizarre  sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once  and i don t mean action scenes  i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing  it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death  again  i am very impressed with the screenwriter s  whoever they are did the impossible  mixed oil and water   i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis s performance  it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy  some of her moments in this film brought me to tears  i mean that  the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible  and i clearly remember getting blurry eyed on a few occasions   i almost feel like i m cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving  kalifornia  a   rating  but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it  i do believe that everyone should see this movie though  i truly do
