 i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner  surely he isn t the avatar of subtlety  as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting  but so what  they re awesomely entertaining  his most famous action movies  like the first three entries in the  death wish series for example  are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns  but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres   like the religious horrors of  the sentinel  for example   he doesn t stand a chance with any of the critics   the sentinel  generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release  when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth  pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd s browning s masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema  freaks  to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years  and why  just because certain prudish and easily offended people  who shouldn t watch the movie in the first place  claim it s an unethical thing to do  i don t suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films  so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place  another major reason why critics didn t warmly welcome  the sentinel  is because jeffrey konvitz  novel   and thus michael winner s screenplay   is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus  according to the merciless pens of horror critics  little more than pure plagiarism  admittedly  the sentinel  borrows multiple substantial elements from  rosemary s baby   the omen  and  the exorcist  but let s face it   s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories  if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and  in all fairness  a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots   the sentinel  honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying  s horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you re not likely to forget easy   alison parker  a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas  moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn  deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to wed her several times already  alison s physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after  and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery  she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats  even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants  she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide  it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building  but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this  it s truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison s brownstone apartment is the earth s gateway to hell itself and she s the chosen one to guard it  because the film s script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation  for nearly   minutes  and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences  michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison s own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fianc e s odd behavior are strictly red herrings  multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius  like alison s flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs  the whole climax  with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above  is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements i ever witnessed   the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive  especially considering  the sentinel  still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn t the most popular among prominent actors  but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective  with such an extended cast  obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos  martin balsam and john carradine  for example  only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together  several others  like christopher walken  jeff goldblum  beverly d angelo and tom berenger  perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays  but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers  my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector  the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up  even though he sports a ridiculous mustache  in my humble opinion  the sentinel  is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie  and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics
