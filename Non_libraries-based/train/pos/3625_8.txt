this is the best picture about baseball since redford whacked the natural our way  dennis quaid and rachel griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives    laced with dreams   dripping in reality  the american dream reignites after   with a true story about the devil ray s mid life rookie  jimmy morris  australian born actress  rachel griffiths  plays a native west texan better than a lot of texans i know  and dennis quaid was perfection 
 cast as the wannabe  gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience  it s real  the on screen chemistry works  if you like baseball heart warmers  you re going to love this film  the ingredients for americana and apple pie were all in there  my popcorn became the  a la mode    and hey  buy the cd  the music rocks and carries the story magnificently  syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should  an area that disappoints me more often than not   criticisms  i d have given the baseball to somebody else  but quaid has something to teach us all about  character  and heart  st  rita and the nuns were a nice decoration  but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them  a little long  worth every minute in the last analysis
