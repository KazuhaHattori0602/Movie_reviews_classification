macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great man
general douglas macarthur  this is of course  the story of one of america s great military figures  and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory  though there is a continuity issue  there may be others  e g  macarthur s speech portrayed in the film as his   address to the u s  military academy on accepting the thayer award did not contain the phrase  old soldiers never die  they just fade away   that was in his speech to congress upon his dismissal by president truman  in   for his alleged insubordination  these two did not see eye to eye  gregory peck is im peck able as the general who vowed he would return to the philippines in world war ii  the film moves quickly and easily with the general  his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career  this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both ww ii and the korean war  nevertheless  peck s portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed   in war there is no substitute for victory
