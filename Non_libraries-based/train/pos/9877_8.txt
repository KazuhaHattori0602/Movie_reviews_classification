  presenting lily mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system  ok now that you know my bias  here are some reasons i think this movie does stand out     although the basic plot   lily mars  judy garland  goes to new york  becomes a star  and wins the heart of her director  van heflin  is a pretty stock hollywood story of the period  the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual  although lily gets her big break when the star quits  she isn t successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show     judy garland  enough said     the supporting cast includes some really great performances  spring byington as lily s mother is truely wonderful  as is fay bainter  the mother of the director   john thornway  van heflin  the standout supporting performance though goes to character actress connie gilchrist as frankie  a one time actress turned theater custodian   worth a watch for sure  one of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams
