i remember this show from swedish television  i was only   years of age and it scared me beyond belief   i would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed   although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the  s and the political climate of the  s  when i think of it  this was a real sci fi  a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are  the term sci fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space ships in them
