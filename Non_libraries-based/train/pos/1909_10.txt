i originally watched   simple rules on the disney channel uk for the first series and got completely hooked  when they didn t show it any more \ was annoyed  but then abc   satred showing the  nd series  i didn t think another series would start after i read john ritter had died  however the  nd series wasn t amazing the latest series is back to it s old excellent standard  i hope they go on to produce more shows soon even though i could watch each show a thousand times  kaley couco is my favourite character as airhead bridget and also performs amazing in charmed  rory is also good  he shares my name and grampa as well i ll keep on watching it until it ends until then i hope it carries on as funny as ever
