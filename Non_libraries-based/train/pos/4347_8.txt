i won t go into too much detail about the plot of this movie as other reviewers have covered pretty much the same ground   just wanted to say that i really enjoyed the film very much  peter falk s performance alone is reason enough to watch the film   a small scale  road trip  movie with falk   paul reiser in upstate ny in the fall is the setting for most of the action in the film   very well written with an adult target audience in mind  plenty of reality based humor   some well played drama give the film a feeling that it could be your own family   really can t say enough about this film except that it s a damn shame that a lovely movie like this doesn t get more exposure while other trashy junk out there does   it s great to see falk with a big leading man role again   he makes the most of it  it proves that his famous friend   writer director john casavettes was right in casting falk in many of his ground breaking films of the  s    s
