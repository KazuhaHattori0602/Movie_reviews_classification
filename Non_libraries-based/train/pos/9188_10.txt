its too bad a lot of people didn t understand this and the next episode   but don t worry  ill explain it too you    this episode is split in   parts   first part is tony s  dream  in his coma  second part is what happens in real life   now what people didn t understand is that tony s dream is more then just a dream  in this episode its about his preparation for his death  he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself  thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world  you will notice what i m saying at the doctor scene  where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains  his life  they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they re own thoughts of what happens when you die    if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing  with great spiritual meanings   like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb    only thing i didn t understand was what the role where of the monks  gonna re watch it till i get this   anyways this episode really touched me  and i don t think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience     no doubt
