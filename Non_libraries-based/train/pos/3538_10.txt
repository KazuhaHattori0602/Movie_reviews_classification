the goal of any james bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy  step into the shoes of agent    frwl  comes closer to this goal than any other game  because this time you control the real james bond  no offense to pierce brosnan  who made a fantastic bond and loaned his voice and likeness to  eon  but sean connery was the original james bond  and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool   i must say at this point  like many others who have reviewed this game  that sean   year old voice doesn t fit his   year old image on screen  and this takes some getting used to  but it s certainly worth it  he makes lines like  bond
 james bond  and  shaken  not stirred  into a big deal again  but controlling sir sean as he takes on the evil organization known as octopus is  as bond said in  octopussy   only the tip of the tentacle  the awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel  it s the original gun barrel from the movies  then you take on first mission  rescuing the prime minister s hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at parliament  and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro  the world of the game is truly the world of the original james bond  right down to the classic rock n roll rendition of the james bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game  as bond infiltrates a secret factory   after the game s opening  the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie  frwl  james bond is sent to turkey to retrieve a lektor device from a russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him  in turkey  bond teams up with lovable sidekick kerim bey  bond must retrieve the device  protect the damsel in distress  and get both safely back to london  bond screenwriter bruce feirstein worked on the script  and he s done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie  the characters from the movie are all recreated well  but some are better than others  the impersonators voicing villains rosa klebb and red grant are uncanny  and there s a moment early on in the game where you interact with a miss moneypenny  m  and q who all look and behave as they did in the original sean connery   movies   what puts this game miles ahead of the other bond games  besides sir sean s voice and likeness  is two notable features in the game play  one is bond focus  while you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other  an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots bond would shoot at  such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death  the other notable feature is the stealth and m l e kills  when you re in close enough range  just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only sean connery s james bond displayed   sean connery s bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent  so you only have a few gadgets  but they re good ones  the q copter is a remote control helicopter that can self destruct and explore areas bond can t reach  like the q spider in  eon  only better  the classic laser watch is useful  not just for getting into sealed rooms  but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available  sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with  but you must experience them for yourself  besides the gadgets  you can go dress bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game  including the gray suit from the movie  the standard black tuxedo  a retro stealth suit  and that classic white tuxedo  all which look exactly like they did when sir sean wore them in the movies  when you drive in the game  you drive the aston martin db  straight out of  goldfinger  it can t turn invisible  but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie  and when you re not flying down the streets of istanbul in the  goldinger  car  you can fly through the air in the  thunderball  jet pack   then there s the multi player  of course  it has to be compared to the standard of the  goldeneye  game  and it fails  also  you can only play bond villains rather than bond himself or the other heroes of the game  but the multi player is amusing  and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing  the basic game does have other flaws  some of the movie s most exciting moments  particularly the gypsy camp shootout  bond s brawl with red grant on the orient express  and a confrontation between bond and rosa klebb s bladed shoe  aren t done justice in game form  and the game is a fast play  even on the hardest difficulty  but overall  this game is the best james bond experience so far
