it is no surprise that writer director michael powell considered  a matter of life and death  his and emeric pressburger s spellbinding fantasy from   to be his favourite of their films together  released during the aftermath of world war   this colourful romantic adventure would have provided just the tonic for a traumatised  recovering nation in need of a good uplift   following a string of other patriotic war films   the archers  made this one their quirkiest  skittish and most patriotic of the lot  quintessentially british for upholding british heritage  shakespeare  beer  fair play  good manners  it is also visibly americanised in its baroque compositions  technical inventiveness and a fine multi ethnic cast   oddly echoing another   classic   it s a wonderful life  amolad opens on a grand firmament  with one of those jolly voice overs preaching about the earth and the heavens  and what a big  wonderful world we live in    it then cuts to the inside of a british cockpit  badly hit  up in flames and with the co pilot already dead  it sounds misconceived  but the connection is soon made lucid with the events that follow   clocking in at nearly   minutes  the rapid fire exchange between british pilot peter  david niven  and american radio contact june  kim hunter  is breathtaking in its intimacy  resigned to dying  peter nevertheless exhausts plenty of vigour  charm and outpouring confessions  and his warm affiliation with june closes with a mutual exchange of  i love you    keeping with the magic of the moment  peter  by oversight of his conductor   whose job it was to transport him to the  other world  escapes death and finds himself stranded on a beach  he later encounters june riding a bicycle  and instantly matches the body with the voice    but realising their error  the high court want peter sent back  and order the french conductor  maurice goring  down to earth to retrieve him  but peter is adamant to live because of june and the conductor s mistake  and wilfully guards his corner   peter s fate ultimately lies with the heavenly court and american prosecutor  raymond massey  whose jury consists of several deceased war heroes and posh british delegates  the surreal trial  which dissolves from b w back into rich technicolor  once the verdict is announced  may well be a dream  but the final shot in the hospital validates the predictable outcome   the abstract  frame filling  stairway to heaven   the american title of the film  is used twice  the first time in b w  when it elevates peter and his enigmatic french guardian upwards  crossing giant statues of peter s potential attorneys for the trial  including abraham lincoln and plato  the second time  the softly lit colour stairway provides the setting for what is an iconic image in cinema   peter and june frozen side by side  their marvelled eyes fixed forward in the frame  their fate sealed   the unlikely affection shared between peter and june never turns mushy or verbose  it s treated with nobility and the perception that the couple are already suitable enough to be married and simply need to convince people of their love  so it can keep them together    the french conductor  who can freeze time and people s bodies  obtrudes many of their key moments together  lecturing peter about history and among his mischievous tricks  pinching peter s  top   game tricks  book and his coffee cup   as visually inspired as other powell pressburger collaborations  this was the first time they combined colour with b w   the latter having a cheerful quality when used for the heaven scenes  and both are equally captivating    the outstanding script more than matches the imaginative set design  with dialogue that sounds so immediate that is doesn t feel like it was written or performed for the screen  amusing and witty  powell pressburger s writing deserves equal acclamation with their forte for colour and composition   made in    a matter of life and death  is one of those films that defies it age  looking fresh and inventive  even in this age where cgi would vamp up its artificial effects  probably stripping them of their emotional wonder    other jarring changes would include the need for reduced average seconds for cutting and the inevitable plea to shorten dialogue so it can preserve the low attention spans of most audiences  powell weaves a spell that subconsciously absorbs the viewer from the first frame  giving him freedom to experiment with images without betraying the logical development of peter s predicament
