when the matrix appeared in   and questioned existence and identity  it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration  that didn t really happen  surprisingly  and it took till   for a movie of similar theme to appear  but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit   the story is of a morgan sullivan  who applies for a job with a high flying techno company called digicorp  his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company  while under an assumed and false identity  his home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he s actually doing  however  things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what s going on  he starts to question who he actually is  this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up   twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated  and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable   it s an enthralling journey through a not too distant future  and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat   highly recommended
