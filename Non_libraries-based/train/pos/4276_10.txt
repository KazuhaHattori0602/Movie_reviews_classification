at first sight  who s singing over there just seems to be an absurd and excellent comedy
 with only a kind of unusual  quiet and slow motion   what a mistake     beginning with two singers on a desert landscape  then a bus and a wonderful bunch of actors  it hides a gem    the folded story  and a false rhythm induces you to think  yes it is comic  but just lets you guess it will be a gentle kind of movie    not at all   very funny by instant  dark subtle cynical on others  its development surprises you all along the story
 very ingeniously and cleverly presented  all the characters are important  and the actors give them full life   and what is astonishing  it s based on deep observation  great mastering of the camera work and has a great meanings  and really everything  the general direction and how also the details are presented  that it simply makes you forget it s a movie  it is like to watch a kind human society  you yet don t know shot by a friend behind a camera   and you re the one behind him  it is simple  and simply exceptional    don t misunderstand me  in no way that would means the script   the quality of picture  the music score have a kind of amateurish way  no  no   it s great art     because it flows like a river
 from high up in the mountain  down to the sea  with all the different sort of grounds and peregrinations that a real river will face on its journey to the sea
 from a tiny thing to a main stream   this metaphoric image i used is the very best way i can find to explain all the charm that has who s singing over there  for me  again  i take the hammer   simply exceptional   i ve seen that the director is the one who made chat blanc chat noir  which i know is quiet famous
 but as i yet didn t see it  i had no idea about this gentleman   others reviewers wrote dithyrambical comments on that film  i fully agree    european eastern cinema is not well know because seldom translated  but i am lucky to have this exemplar one in original language  with good english subtitles  all in all   deep  delicious and exceptional   for fast and empty exploding types and special effect buffs  avoid it at any cost  it may be too subtle and good for you    but if you re interested in different genres and or classics  i guess you won t regret this one  and in case of buying  it will have good companionship in your personal dvd library  with such no less than merited big names like billy wilder  lubitsch  or sacha guitry among some of my preferred directors   at least for this movie     a film is never really good unless the camera is an eyes in the head of a poet orson welles
