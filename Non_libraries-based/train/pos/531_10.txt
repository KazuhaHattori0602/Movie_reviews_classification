this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made  i ve seen this movie for the first time a week ago  since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh s the pilgrimage   give me my scallop shell of quiet  my staff of faith to walk upon  my scrip of joy  immortal diet  my bottle of salvation  my gown of glory  hope s true gage  and thus i ll take my pilgrimage  
   do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell s and emeric pressuburger s lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening  because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this movie   i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god  i beg your pardon  sir  so  do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime  well  well you ll see  we ve written directed and produced  i know where i m going  colonel blimp  red shoes
 do you think that enough sir  it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god  nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death  the fact that other people s lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody  notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie   of course old timers will be tempted to say  they don t do movies like this one any more  they ll be partially mistaken  they didn t make movies like this in the past times either   i ve have already quoted keats here  but i ll repeat his words  a thing of beauty is a joy forever
