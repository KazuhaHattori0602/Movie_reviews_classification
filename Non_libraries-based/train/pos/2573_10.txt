when my  year old daughter and her friends get together for movie night  there s one movie they insist on watching over and over again  you guessed it  k  the third installment in the highly successful k  franchise starring everybody s favorite tv dad  jim belushi   folks  i knew it was possible to wear out a vhs tape  but a dvd  this has been played so often that it s starting to skip  no joke  but of course you ll have that when you own a film so charming  so brilliant   of course  we have to thank the one and only tom hanks for introducing us to the beloved cop dog genre with turner and hooch  however  even that film doesn t measure up to the sheer excellence presented in all three k  movies   some nay sayers say belushi ran out of steam with this third movie in the series  poppycock  i say  while you might suspect that a third installment   direct to video  at that   may not seem like something worth watching  you d prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie   i won t give away the plot  but i will say that belushi and his panting partner give their best performance yet   one that will have you howling with laughter  it s a shame john belushi isn t alive to see what great strides his brother has made in the acting world   i highly recommend your teenage daughter introduces this film to her bffs at her next slumber party  don t forget the puppy chow
