people call this a comedy  but when i just watched it  i laughed  only once  i guess the problem is that i first saw it when i was    and i wasn t old enough to understand that it wasn t meant to be  taken seriously  there were quite a few scenes that were meant  to be funny  but i cared too much about the characters to laugh at  them   i suggest that you watch this film next time you re falling in love   and try to take it seriously  i think you ll find that  despite a few silly  flaws  it s one of the most moving love stories you ve ever seen
