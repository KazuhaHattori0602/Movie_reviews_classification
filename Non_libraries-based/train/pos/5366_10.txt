i m sitting here nov   and i still can t help rave about this movie  arnold s best movies came in about a   year span  running man  predator  and total recall   all   are amazing  the cheesy one liners by arnold in this movie will make you laugh on more than one occasion  i find the acting in this movie surprisingly good as was the case in predator and totall recall  they did a great job in trying to make the scenes futuristic as it is supposed to take place in   but you can t help but snicker at the  s style haircuts on the men and woman in the crowd and the normal television monitors in the running man studio which we all know here in   are on the way out with the emergence of flat panel and hdtv s  also the computer graphics of the  the running man  game show intro would not look like that in   nevertheless the storyline is absolutely fantastic  not once during this movie did i want to get up and not care about the ending which is something i do often with today s movie s  i really think that arnold s acting is much better than he s given credit for  now i would not have elected him governor but that s california for you  buzzsaw  dynamo  fireball  subzero are fantastic  stalkers  as well and i find the producers don t try to overkill the fight scenes  when the stalker is dead he s dead  it doesn t go on for   minutes each  the stalker scenes are quick and entertaining but they don t try and overplay it  i give this movie a   and that s coming from someone who doesn t enjoy a lot of movies these days  if you get the right actors and the right story then the futuristic graphical displays that you d see in   are not important or necessary
