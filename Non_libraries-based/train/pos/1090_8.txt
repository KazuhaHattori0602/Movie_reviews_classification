one of cary grant s most enduring comedies is mr  blandings builds his dream house  although judging by the size of it the dwelling would be a dream mansion today  still cary was making a good living in the advertising field even though he was having a devil of a time trying to come up with a slogan for ham with the brand name of wham   what made this film so popular was the housing shortage of the post world war ii years  returning veterans from the war were claiming their entitlements under the gi bill of rights which included home loans  the problem was there literally were not enough houses to satisfy the demand  around the time the book by eric hodgins and the film were so popular congress passed and president truman signed the taft ellender  wagner housing law which put the government for the first time in the home building business   i had an uncle and aunt who were around the same time building their own home which they moved into in the early fifties  like cary grant and myrna loy they had two daughters and were looking to get out of inner city rochester  their place wasn t quite as grand as a house in connecticut with eighteen rooms  still they lived there the rest of their lives the way cary and myrna most likely did   of course it was expensive and the costs just keep adding up and up  threatening to send cary to the cleaners  cary and myrna also have melvyn douglas around to offer counsel  usually too late  truth be told he s kind of sweet on myrna and cary knows it   myrna loy s role is simply an extension of nora charles  if you can imagine the charles s moving to the country and william powell having the headaches cary grant does  the film would still work just fine   mr  blandings builds his dream house still works well as comedy because the situations are universal  and this review is dedicated to my uncle walter and aunt kate who lived in their dream house together for over   years
