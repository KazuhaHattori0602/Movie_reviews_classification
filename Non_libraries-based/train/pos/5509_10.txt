i m going to review the   films as a whole because i feel that is how it should be considered  and watched  when i talk about  the film  i am talking about parts       together when watched one after the other  as they should be   thank you jon anderson  steven soderbergh   benicio del toro   this film is a refreshing  bold  gritty and true film  and  it hearkens a new style of film making  no faux drama  no swelling sound track  not faux documentary style  just clean shots and an attempt to stick to the facts  i have been reading jon anderson s  che guevara  a revolutionary life  and recently finished fidel s auto biography  and this had helped my ability to soak this film in properly  but i have to say that it is jon anderson s exhaustive  penultimate and wonderful biography that has given this film the proper historical back bone  anderson was consultant on this film  or these   films  what makes this film a true thing is that it is clean  no swelling music or slow motion photography to heighten drama  and even more importantly  no fake documentary shaky camera  just square shots and straight forward shooting style  the type of camera used makes you feel right there in the jungle  benicio del toro should be given full honors for this  i never doubted him as che throughout the film  not once  he did a wonderful job and i will respect him for ever for this  some people complain that the film only deals with   slices of his life and not the whole  but i think this is one of the true beautiful aspects of this film  it doesn t try to be everything  it doesn t try to  tell the story  a person s life is too multifaceted to try and tell in         or   hours  this is one of the subtle beauties of this film  it resists that temptation  and stays focused on the intent of letting us get a feel for che  his developing militaristic mind and the forces around him  it focuses on   slices of time  the battle to over throw batista  che s u n  speech and the gorilla preparations in bolivia   motorcycle diaries  already told his young man side  and i applaud s  soderbergh for focusing on other aspects instead  i keep referring to jon anderson s book and the film stays true  the only weak link for me are the casting  not the performance  of matt damon  in a film so loaded with true to life performances  an american   matt damon  playing a bolivian is a clunky stretch   he does well  but after so much care in the casting  this was an over site  small and completely forgiven  the reality that the rest of the casting gives you  and most notably benicio del toro s amazing job  put s this film at the top of my list   the fact that this film went almost straight to video say s something about how the cold war ethics that would never allow the  revolutionized cuba  to become what it might have  are still at work keeping it s story quiet  if not out of clandestine muffling  then out of the effects of properly done propaganda that has prejudiced this topic   this is a must see film  and jon anderson s  che guevara  a revolutionary life  is a must read if you want to start to get a grasp of the early effects on the global mind set regarding the expansion of international   political financial chess moves of the  s   s    s that placed unfair pressure on our south american neighbors  and the effects it fostered
