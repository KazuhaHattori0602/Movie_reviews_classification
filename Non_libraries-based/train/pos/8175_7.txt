before we begin  i have a fear of dentists  this movie gives me the creeps and even makes me cringe  that is what i love about this film  the movie is kind of boring  for that  i take   stars off    spoiler alert   the movie revolves around dr  alan feinstone who has just found out his wife has been cheating on him  soon  he begins to have hallucinations and begins torturing his patients  killing co workers  and he has even tortured his wife to death and killed the man he was having an affair with    end spoiler    the movie is very bloody and gory  i would recommend it if you are into gore   i give this film   stars out of   dr  alan feinstein is not your normal everyday dentist
