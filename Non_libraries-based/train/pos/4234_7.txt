attention  spoiler   many people told me that  planet of the apes  was tim burton s worst movie and apart from that much weaker than the original film  so i decided not to see it  another friend of mine who hadn t seen the movie yet  advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a tim burton movie is still a tim burton movie  i decided to do it  and i found that he was right   it s clear that a remake of such a famous film as `planet of the apes  is automatically influenced by commercial thinking  still  tim burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `beetlejuice  or `batman  if you are already fond of burton movies  it s hard not to like one of his films  even if it has some flaws  nerve racking monkey squeals  over dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been  without difficulties  replaced by anbody else   what the film gives us in the first place  is an answer to the question  what s the result when tim burton is instructed to create a remake  first of all  burton wouldn t be burton  if he wouldn t refuse to call it a remake from the start  it s a `re imagining  on the other hand  burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring charlton heston  as human  and he knows that a remake doesn t exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared  so all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film  e  g  by referencing to quotes  concerning the story line  burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first  and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with   and here is the spoiler   leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever    now  this is the burtonesque answer to people s expectations they hold because of the astonishing  shocking ending of the first `planet of the apes  an ending  even more unexpected  more astonishing and  completely confusing  because   and here i m disagreeing with various `planet of the apes homepages and  platforms   it does not make any sense  there cannot be a meaning to it  or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective  tim burton is playing his cruel games  he does it with a grin and he does it well  burton fans will sure like it  others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism  well  and i don t think producers will ever ask burton to direct a remake again
