here s what i knew about  atlantis  before watching it       it s officially disney s first animated sci fi adventure  i m not sure how accurate that is  i like to nitpick  but it made me curious first time i heard it described       the preview looked  for the most part  damn cool  evidently  it was also  too cryptic  according to some critics after the fact       it apparently did so badly that disney said   screw it  let s re release  spy kids   so  with all that said  how is the movie   hella cool   i m a sucker for animated fantasy that involves stirring music and rampant special effects anyway  but  atlantis  goes all out  it s a throwback to all the cgi eye candy shots in  beauty and the beast  and  aladdin  so much so that it s almost an effects animator s best of show  the characters maybe aren t that memorable  except  perhaps  for the ship s medical officer  and the plot s a little dull  but this isn t a movie you watch for the plot   here s a controversy that bothers me  the  failure   as in  it  only  took in  like  five hundred million or something  i know animators who d kill to see fifteen bucks of that  of this movie compared to the popularity of  shrek  and  monsters inc  has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation  i don t think that s true  how do you account for the  south park  movie  what about  final fantasy  really  the story and the artistry is everything  not the method  i don t know what disney s comeback movie will be like  but i don t think they re out of the picture yet
