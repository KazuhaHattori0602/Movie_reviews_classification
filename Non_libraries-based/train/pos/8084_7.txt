  i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night  i ve been a fan of tolkien s work for about   years now  ever since i got out of high school  i didn t grow up on this movie perhaps my mother kept me away from it  it s definitely not for children  not that it s bad in a graphic sense  but that the themes would go right over most   year olds heads  overall  the animation was excellent considering this was made in   i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense  but i am bothered that bashki didn t just add another   minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts  that would ve made it the ultimate movie  i was bothered by it s abrupt end  and then when i heard return of the king sucked  i was bothered even more  too bad it wasn t one great animation film  it might have garnered a higher vote from me  i give it a   i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr
