i was not really a big fan of star trek until past   years  thanks to the advent of netflix and post   video technology distribution  i am able to embark into the past of all the great star trek episodes  for those that don t really watch every single episode and know them by heart  through tng  ds  voyager  etc  general popular consensus will say    i like the next generation  the best  that s because captain picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of star trek starvation  but to be quiet honest  i appreciate the creativity of voyager s episodes more than tng  voyager s episodes also progresses through time unlike tng  granted data from tng is great but it eventually gets old but voyager s doctor   now that s creativity  instead of making artificial intelligence awkward and jerky  give him the freedom to express beyond anything you imagined  not only is picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive  self growth  as a doctor  self realization now that is science fiction at its best  endgame portray him as a husband married to an  organic  inventing neuro implant transceiver for human machine interface  and even   in the episode before endgame  to disobey captain s order and make  human  mistakes  unlike ds  which are blessed with   beautiful women right from  st episode  voyager has to survive   seasons without jeri ryan and i believe it is picardo that carried them with his personality  of course the rest of the voyager s cast chemistry just flows effortless  harry kim and tom paris   very natural  i love tuvoc occasional humor  despite being a vulcan  finally  i m so glad they got rid of that original female captain   oh  if you get to watch the rare footage   thank god for kate  she has developed through the   years into an extremely confident  believable  and respectable female captain  what a great job  thank you star trek for making voyager  i enjoy every episode  the creative exploration of possibilities  of morals  and of our cosmic expanse
