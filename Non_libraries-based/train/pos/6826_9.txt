john cassavetes   opening night  is fantastic and fascinating  fantastic because it plays with the deepest fears we have inside our imagination  fascinating because it never ceases surprising us  with its very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes  anyone who appreciates characters won t be able to take their eyes off the screen   the story of an unstable actress  myrtle gordon   gena rowlands  trying to put herself together for a play  fighting her demons   opening night  is not only about a woman on the verge of a breakdown but also about the complexities of the lives of theater actors and the theatrical world  all of cassavetes  characters here are experienced people that know about the world of theater  so half of the film takes place on a stage  either where the performers do their job or at backstage  where producers and writers and directors do their job   cassavetes is so harsh with his characters that this unkindness turns towards the audience  but the audience in the cinema  because there is another audience  in the theater of the film  that doesn t know what is really happening and laugh because they think everything is performance  and that s essentially what it is  it s just that the audience in the theater doesn t get to see  backstage  the way we do  they don t experience gena rowlands  exuberance before she goes out to that stage  but most importantly  they don t know the reasons why she acts the way she does   i always thought that it would be difficult to be friends with an actor  myrtle  rowland  says she s an actress and that s the only thing she knows how to do  and i imagine that if i had a friend who was a professional performer  it would be really difficult to tell when he s saying the truth because i would know he s an actor and he can fake anything at any time  a lot of the things that myrtle does during the awful experiences the film puts her through
we suspect if she s being real  the rest of the characters suspect too   there is the writer  sarah  joan blondell  who can t understand why myrtle doesn t understand the character she s written for her  there s the director  manny  ben gazzara  who can t accept the fact that his best actress might be losing it  the producer david  paul stewart  who doesn t know where to stand and myrtle s co star maurice  cassavetes himself  who can t deal with the love they have for each other   when she witnesses the death of a teenager  a fan  all of this comes together and affects myrtle  but no one knows if her delusions are for real  they don t say anything because they don t want to upset her  but the movie enters in a state of subconsciousness that only myrtle accepts  at times  we can tell that everyone has had it  during these moments  cassavetes  brilliant script depicts a scary brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a discussion backstage  and not only what everyone tells myrtle but also what she says to them   here are people who are not afraid to speak their mind and constantly change what they are thinking  just like cassavetes  way of making cinema  and in this aspect  the performances are more important here than in  shadows  because the characters are involved in a bigger picture  a bigger story that steps out of the trivial   but in another aspect  the actual way of making cinema  this movie is no different from  shadows  there s a beautiful thing in the way al ruban s camera shoots the characters  when someone s talking  the camera doesn t focus on him  it shoots the person who is listening  so we can see how he or she reacts to the things the other one s saying  sometimes they don t care  sometimes they are happy  sometimes devastated   improvisation might still be there  though  among all these wonderful performances  near the end  there s an unexpected scene where cassavetes and rowlands start talking  non stop  whether this was improvised or not is not something we have to wonder  we have just got to watch  and watching both of them exchanging life experiences and seeing words come truly alive in a conversation that means a lot more than what it shows
it doesn t get more natural than that
