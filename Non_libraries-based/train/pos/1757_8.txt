the key to the  year old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a  year old virgin  but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one  in a genre of crass  comedy  that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters  the  year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent  heartfelt script that doesn t use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes  that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke  in fact  as it is a curiosity   carell  a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show castmember  uses the concept of the film to expand his character   we get to understand why andy is the way he is  it s the little things that make this film work  when andy s co worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend  andy describes his failed efforts at cooking  when andy rides his bike to work  he signals his turns  he doesn t just adorn his home with action figures   he paints them  and talks to them  and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood  a lesser comedy wouldn t even begin to focus on all of these things   the plot is fairly simplistic   andy s co worker pals find out he s never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman  it s a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility   andy s friends are a complement to his neurotic nature  david  paul rudd  has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her  jay  romany malco  is a womanizing ladies  man and cal  seth rogen  is a tattooed sexaholic  their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times  and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic   finally andy meets single mom trish  played by catherine keener  and  much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren t worth it  he falls in love with her  they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days   trish being unaware that andy is still a virgin   the  year old virgin was directed by judd apatow  the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy  and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and geeks  apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor  and the script   co written by carell   offers plenty   however  in the end the most interesting and  indeed surprising  aspect of the  year old virgin is its maturity  by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics  and even i was surprised by its warm reception  but after seeing the film  it s easy to understand why  we like andy  we care about him  he s not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy clich    he s a real  living  breathing person  his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety  his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet  it strikes a chord with the audience   although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor  it doesn t offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen  the best sex comedies work this way   from risky business to american pie   and that is the major difference between something like the  year old virgin and   days and   nights
