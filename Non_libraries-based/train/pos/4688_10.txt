i showed this to my  th grade class about   years ago and the students loved it  i loved it  too  the story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is amazing  the cast of creatures is deep and they all play their parts well  the battle between the two cold blooded titans is truly classic footage   alan root has done some incredible camera work and this should have won the best documentary oscar  the copy i have doesn t have orson welles narrating it  derek jacobi  and it isn t called the  mysterious castles of clay  just  castles of clay  this makes me think that it must have been done with welles added for star power and an oscar push   i was lucky enough to find this vhs just recently and it is now my children s favorite movie  they brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a disney movie  if you can find this movie you are indeed lucky
