it is a real shame that nearly no one under   knows the  over the top  writing of michael o donoghugh  magazine articles and snl skits that were genius for the time and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos  thus leading them to mr mikes mondo video    this movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone  the viewer experiences such things as cat diving swimming with the man who thinks he s found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence  then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired  hula hops  pet rocks  rainbow dread wigs etc  then we enter the music world  punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film  where  d  rate bar performer rootboy slim performs  boogie till you puke  in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze  now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music  in many different styles with many different instruments the sound of telstar plays and replays  for those who don t understand telstar was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph  mr mikes seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes  now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of sid vicious  ex sex pistol not the wrestler  singing my way  his version is very different than sinatras as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen it s good  that is the sad part  in the vhs release paul anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience     minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol    i would give the theater release a   or   the video is closer to a   and now that so much is pass  i can see where many people would give it a   or   if you want to see a good o donoghugh script watch scrooged it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent
