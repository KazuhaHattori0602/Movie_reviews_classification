some kids are hiking in the mountains  and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator  he puts on the gladiator s helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers   this thing is just so utterly senseless it s maddening  here s a short list of things that don t make any sense     a guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside  the guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside  then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent   arriving the next morning  he was only   feet away     these two dunderheads then hear another girl scream  what    feet away  but don t investigate because they re afraid they ll get lost     another guy and a girl are walking around  and in about their  th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances  protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor  i mean  what the  first off  that s just a really stupid thing to say  secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together     a wounded girl attacks demonicus and he stops her  telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing  um  yeah  we kinda noticed she s wounded and not dead because she s up and walking around  but  thanks for that tidbit of information     one girl is tied up in demonicus  lair  and when someone attempts to free her  she instead instructs this person to go and get help  um  look  idiot  if she set you free  which would take about   seconds  there would be no need to get help   and it just goes on and on  the whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods  then they fight  then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends  then they wander around some more  it s just so damned boring and pointless that i turned the dvd off halfway through    none of these characters are sympathetic  especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time  demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time i saw him   he looks like a kid in a halloween costume  scrunching his face up to look evil  he runs  or should i say scampers around like he s gay  the special effects are comedic  the acting is for the most part awful  and nothing makes any sense   overall  maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it  getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue  creating characters with actual likable personalities  having some sort of logical flow to the action  and maybe even making demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit  but no  instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death
