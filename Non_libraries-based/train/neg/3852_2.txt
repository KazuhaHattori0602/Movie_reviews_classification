this was one of the most boring movies i ve ever seen
 i don t really know why
 just your run of the mill stories about guy who is about to get married  and starts to fancy someone else instead  story has been told a thousand times  nothing new or innovative about it at all   i don t really know what was wrong with this film  most of the time when these kinds of actors actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before  it s really entertaining  there are usually little clever thing in them that aren t really in any other  for some reason  this one just doesn t hold your attention  you can pick out some funny parts  or clever ideas in it  but for some reason they re just not funny  nor clever in any way
 i wish i new how to explain it  but i don t
 just don t waste your time on this one
