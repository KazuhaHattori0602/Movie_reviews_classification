as some other comments show  this movie might scare you  when you re a little child   and that is probably all that it is good for   however  if you re older  this movie only does one thing  suck majorly  and thereby i don t mean the acting  its soundtrack  cutting or s th  like that  i m simply talking about the  plot   if you can call it that    spoilers ahead    i don t want to give any more spoilers than necessary  if after reading this  you really still want to watch this movie  but if you graduated from any school  this is just a big insult of your intelligence  when watching this  i was stunned most of the time  because what was happening was just that stupid   this includes    the forming of unite  an evil un association      we are just supposed to believe it s evil  is it even evil at all  if so  why is it evil    the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo     there is no necessity to impose this on the people  so why the hell  no pun intended  are they doing it     inviting christ to your heart merely as lip service    because there s nothing anybody  who in this movie is considered  a real christian  ever does  besides saying that stupid prayer  so just say that prayer before the rapture and you re saved   no matter what    thus  rating
