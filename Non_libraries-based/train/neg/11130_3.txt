despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky  or think he s a tired relic from the  s  i really had no opinion of the man  save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist  although i could not elucidate any of his theories  and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings  so  stumbling across the dvd of the   documentary noam chomsky  rebel without a pause  in a used video store  a film which followed him on a   book tour for his book   i decided to get it  just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person  pro or con  spoke of him  while glad i got the film  my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was  so what s all the fuss about   for a man with so many degrees  lauded as  the most important intellectual alive  by the new york times  according to the dvd s case  there sure was not a lot there  intellectually speaking  i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate  and i wouldn t even want to watch what a william f  buckley could do to him  granted  the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere  and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he d say  rather than being on linguistics  so maybe that s the reason he came off so badly  but  again  if he is a linguist  and tops in his field  why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise 
  even worse are his acolytes  who seem to further insulate the man from reality  by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins  what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film  this much i knew  he was generally considered a has been  and pretty much irrelevant intellectually  since the fall of the soviet empire  the film is so poorly structured  and without a narrative thread  that it s difficult to separate all of the jumble  his wife  carol  as example  apparently gave one interview  which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film  she seems a nice enough woman  but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life  the lone interesting thing she says is that   was a great thing for the chomskys  for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then   not surprisingly  this sort of film gives almost no biographical background  it s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this  great man  bears  chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one  stylistically  there are no camera movements  no interesting edits  nor any signature touches  and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky  videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that  and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial  that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him  this is really poor film making by director and editor will pascoe  who in the dvd s filmmaker statement  shows he s yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky s  other than that  one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary  but mere agitprop  and a vanity piece of agitprop  at that  is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer  he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds   given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky s lectures at mcmaster university  in ontario  canada  prior to the american invasion of iraq in   much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era  yes  he makes some good points  here and there  on american media complicity before the war  but he follows them up with sheer lunacy  for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc  and not fully plotted out cabals  as example  he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace  but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled  similarly  he claims trilateralists run the world and that people s fear of crime is yet another cabal s result  of course  that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers  and all that wasted time and money district attorneys  offices consume  he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades  when castro and company were great sponsors of it  in latin america  asia  and africa  until the soviet union fell  i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in idaho   in his simpleminded world without grays  chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco  whom he reviles  are  even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals  in short  chomsky is a man living in the past  in over his head on most issues  and out of his depth intellectually  near this film s end he warns   be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice  yet one can only laugh  as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn t like  no matter how barbarous their crimes  and anti intellectual their posit  please  pause before you waste your time and money on this silly  and already irrelevant  dvd
