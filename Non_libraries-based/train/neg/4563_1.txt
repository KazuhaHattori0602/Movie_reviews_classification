this movie is possibly the cheapest  cheesiest  and poorest sequel ever made   yet  it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by disney  and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish   it s a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions    spoiler alert  the first one s all about beast and belle being petty over a pathetic argument  then  three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to belle  part way through this little episode  belle has wall eyes  which made my siblings and i laugh so hard  then  she and the beast fight more over the letter  and later learn the meaning of forgiveness  how old are they  certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness   then  the next one s all about lumiere being the world s biggest dope when it comes to romance  this coming from the man who could woo anything female  and they make fifi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill belle  and winds up getting off scotch free by the end of it  what a message to send the kids   then  the next one s all about mrs  potts being angsty  and the next one after that s all about beast becoming overly possessive of a bird  to the point where he just seems downright silly   the animation s so ugly  it kills  there are at least   mistakes you can plainly see  and the coloring is awful   belle s a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong  plus  she s petty and very different from the usual belle   and the side characters are annoying   i mean  cogsworth and lumiere fight almost all the time  i know they did that in the movie  but it was overdone in this   but the worst character is mrs  potts  she s ruined in this  i can t even describe it  just buy it and see for yourself   i give it a   for the sap  but i give it a   for comedy
