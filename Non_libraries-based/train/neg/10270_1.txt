 american nightmare  is officially tied  in my opinion  with  it s pat  for the worst movie of all time   seven friends  oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of  friends  gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare  a pirate radio show  it s hosted by a guy with a beard  that s the most exciting aspect of his show   chandler  monica  joey  and  oh wait  i mean  wayne  jessie  and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj  unbeknownst to them  a crazed nurse serial killer is listening   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and  wait  sorry again  by making their fears come to life  these fears include such stunners as  voodoo  and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures   no  really   this movie was  in a word  rotten  crazy nurse s killing spree lacks motivation  there s nothing to make the viewer  jump  the ending blows  and again voodoo   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones  rent  american nightmare  with them   if you care for your loved ones even a little bit go to your local blockbuster  rent all of the copies of  american nightmare  and hide them in your freezer
