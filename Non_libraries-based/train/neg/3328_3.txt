apparently there s a very good reason why i never heard about  dr  hackenstein  before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance  that reason is  it sucks  it s a very pointless  dull  imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy parody  actually  to be honest  i m not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late  s horror effort  in the year   at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences  dr  elliot hackenstein needs exactly three women   no more  no less   to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed  she s only just a living head left now  but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers  so when dr  hackenstein yells out  i need three female bodies to bring back my wife  his words aren t even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females  and one really annoying nerdy kid  with car trouble show up at his doorstep  why doesn t that ever happen to me   i need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem  
 see  nothing  anyway  the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled  but unfortunately   for science that is   he develops sympathy for one of the three girls   dr  hackenstein  is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of  re animator  and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic  like a severed head talking one liners  it s easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere  as it doesn t appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre  the funniest character is undoubtedly the loud speaking female grave robber ruby  depicted by the anti cherubic anne ramsey   s horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes craven s  deadly friend  where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball   dr  hackenstein  supposedly takes place in the early  s  but there are hardly any attempts to re create the atmosphere of that era  except maybe for some automobiles  dr  hackenstein s laboratory is a quite clich d  s set piece  with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors
