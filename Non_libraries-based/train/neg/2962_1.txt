movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining  so can whoopi goldberg movies  but whoopi and dinosaurs   after the first   minutes of  theodore rex  i had come to one conclusion  this movie is evil  evil  vile  wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience  nothing this bad is made by accident  this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber   first of all  whoopi does not make good action movies  watch  fatal beauty  if you think i m lying  but the film makers don t care   she s a tough cop here  yet again    seen a million cop buddy flicks this week  well  here s number one million and one  pal   don t like cute  humanistic animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them  too bad  here s another one and he s a cop  too   you one of those people that hates car chases  shoot outs  sloppy dialogue  boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people  goldberg  mueller stahl  roundtree  stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write off  a big tax write off   and you read this review all the way to the end  you deserve a sequel  seriously   no stars  not a one  and if they really make a sequel to  theodore rex  hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise cracking foam rubber dinosaurs   now  i d pay to see that
