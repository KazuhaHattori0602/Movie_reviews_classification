this is by the far worst piece of cr p i ve ever seen in my life  it barely made sense  it wasn t scary at all  unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming  sarah michelle gellar needs to stop with these sh tty horror films  i think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted  shite  when the credits rolled up    on my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go     the return   cabin fever   silent hill  the reason i made silent hill  rd is because it showed some frightening scenes  but the rest was absolute cr p  same with cabin fever  made no sense  but the return topped that list  its worse than silent hill and cabin fever put together
