this film is a pure failure  i am a steve martin fan  but even he can t save the tired idea and swiss cheese script  think  police academy   and apply it to a military parody  yuck   i do not feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received  and rightfully deserved  it is extremely misleading  i have often seen this film marked down to   in the grocery store and now i certainly know why   if only i could get my   minutes back
