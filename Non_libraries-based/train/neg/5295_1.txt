a teenager who seems to have it all commits suicide  it leaves his family and his best friend  keanu reeves  asking a lot of questions and blaming themselves   good idea  badly handled  for starters this has been done before  mostly in tv movies and after school specials  aside from some swearing and dialogue  hence the pg  rating  this added nothing new  the outcome is predictable and reeve s attempts at acting were truly painful to watch  he s good now but not in   aside from that his character was dressed like a slob and always looked so dirty is was hard to build up sympathy   that aside the movie is dull  i saw every scene coming and every  surprise  was telegraphed  i basically couldn t wait for this thing to get over   i have a vague recollection of seeing it in a theatre in   and hating it  it bombed badly  it still looks lousy almost   years later  the subject is worth handling but it s been done better  with better acting  in countless other movies   ordinary people  comes to mind  you can skip this one
