there are a lot of highly talented filmmakers actors in germany now  none of them are associated with this  movie   why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this  you could have made   good films with the budget of this garbage  it s not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs  pretending to be funny  what is funny though is that the film s producer  who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch  is playing the youngest dwarf   the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying  you re supposed to laugh now  it s hard to believe that this crap s supposed to be a comedy   many people actually stood up and left the cinema   minutes into the movie  i should have done the same instead of wasting my time   pain
