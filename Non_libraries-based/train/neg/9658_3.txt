my god  what an incredible movie it is  reminded me so much of the similar scene in mel gibson s movie  we were soldiers  when  the company is not lost  they re just cut off  and the other scene in pearl harbour when the british officer says to ben affleck  if all americans are like you  then god help the nation that goes to war with america   put all   movies together and you would have enough bullshit to fertilise the entire sahara desert   the story of the cut off battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that american preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it  there were audible groans in the cinema during the above mentioned scene in pearl harbour  no kidding either  the lost battalion however is really in a class of its own 
    americans think they are unbeatable
inspired bravery
    i actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster  the movie that is    the fighting scenes were well made   stars for that  but if the script is manure  then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons  it is still manure  the writer  james carabatsos  also wrote those other screamers
hamburger hill  no mercy   heartbreak ridge  someone  please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage   the director  russell mulcahy is an australian too  god  the shame
