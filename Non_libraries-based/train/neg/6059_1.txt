i have to say as being a fan of the man who created halloween the fog christine the thing   probably his best films   then you got this pos  i can t logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with cigarette burns  at least his son made a decent soundtrack   you have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn t seem like a movie  it looked as if someone else directed it for one thing  i won t believe carpenter put any effort into this at all   i was just listening to his old school h h the fog soundtrack and it was awesome  especially for the times   he was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films
