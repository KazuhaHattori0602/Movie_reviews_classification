this is an interesting left turn for reel   indies  two harbors is a b w   minute film from minnesota that features non actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life  i applaud the boldness of the reel   programmers of thinking out of the box when selecting this film  i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with  as a matter of fact  i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself  not that two harbors is completely without merit  but i ll get to that a little later    as is common with independent films  two harbors is limited in terms of location  there are only two real locations   a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer  which is the home of the middle aged main character  vic  played by alex cole  writer director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic  who is one of the dealers there  he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information   vic sells space toys  he prefers to call them  outer space action figures  and he is a caustic asshole  this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors   all the chatting  i ve said it before and i ll say it again   we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually  there are exceptions  of course  but generally  endless patter is not so engaging on film   particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition  pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose  a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store  he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don t even advance the plot one iota  this is the kind of thing that makes even a   minute film feel long   the other problem with two harbors is the acting  i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film  but i really don t feel like there s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films  there are plenty of good actors out there  many of which willing to work on low budget projects   even in minnesota  many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals  but that is na ve  in narrative film making  next to the story  nothing is more important than the acting performances  if you don t believe the people enacting your story  your audience is lost   originally  i thought vculek was using non actors  but as the film went on  i decided that they were probably community theater type actors  it wasn t that they were uncomfortable on camera  it s that they were overly theatrical  i e  big  granted  the best of the actors were the two leads   cole and catherine e  johnson as cassie  a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic s extra terrestrial hunt  they seemed to have the most training  but they were still a little rough around the edges  the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only   not coming from a real  organic place within  ms  johnson  in particular  is an interesting case  she definitely has a presence   a midwestern charm about her  but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have  she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and  slave  labor  relying on stock gestures like eye rolls  lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world   i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here s what i mean  without giving too much away  there is a fade to white an hour into the film  after that  the story takes a stunning turn  which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful   it s like a sucker punch to the gut  but in a good way  it s almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters  the last five minutes of the film don t have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film   subtle  detailed  cole does his best work of the film  and most importantly  cinematic  then  with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all   that it s based on a true story  which got me to thinking  with all the dialogue  the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities  it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re write  two harbors might make a really kick ass stage play   maybe even a one act  if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this  i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker  reel   or whomever  there might be something to this story after all
