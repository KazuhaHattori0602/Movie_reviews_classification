somewhere between the food court and zip s  the mall in this film  has an explosives store  this is the only place the title character  can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale   a fictional town has a new mall  built on some land that was  condemned  cute girl  i didn t catch her name  gets a job as a  waitress there  she lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the  mall stands  the villainous mall owner hires the arsonist  responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security  guard ends up dead  rob estes  eons before  silk stalkings  is a  photog reporter trying to find a story  he hooks up with cute girl   and their mutual  funny  friend pauly shore  and try to find out if eric  is still alive  he is  living in the mall basement   and traveling  through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his  former girlfriend  including the arsonist  eventually  he kidnaps her  and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the  scene before the big kablooey  morgan fairchild is along for the  ride as the mayor yes  she s the mayor   of course  you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire  story is in the title  someone named eric is taking revenge against  people as a phantom of a mall  this also means there is no  suspense  we know eric is behind this  but we still have to see  estes and cute girl go through the motions of a silly investigation   watch as fairchild  who we know has been in cahoots with the  mall owner all along  pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of  a crowded party  yet no one says a word as she leads them to her  office  and her eventual death  the fictional town is huge  yet nary a  policeman is ever called  everyone relies on mall security for order   eric has been hiding since the mall was built  but i am not sure  where  he seems to live in a basement area  but you would think  some construction worker would have found him  he also has  furnished his love pad quite well  and found a few outlets  since he  has electricity  it might be nicer than your own apartment   pauly shore fans  both of you  take note  he tricks a security guard  out of his booth by mooning the camera  yes  stop scanning  celebrity skin and playgirl  this is where you get to see a grainy  black and white shot of pauly s south shore  although no weezil   this is just junk  and proof positive that i am down to renting just  about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section  this  film is not eric s revenge  it is the film maker s revenge for me  being dumb enough to watch it  here is my revenge  i do not  recommend it  that ll show  em   this is rated  r  for physical violence  some gun violence  gore   some profanity  some female nudity  brief male nudity  and some  sexual content
