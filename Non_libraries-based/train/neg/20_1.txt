this movie was terrible  at first i just read the plot summary and it looked ok  so i watched it  the acting was terrible  it was like the actor were almost camera shy  everything seemed fake  i feel bad for edward furlong  terminator   was my favorite a few years ago  i ve watched it at least   times   the plot was also crap  the writers were probably sleep deprived when they came up with the lines   on the plus side  it s the good kind of bad movie  the one you keep watching just to see how much worst could it will get  so that later you can tell other people how you couldn t believe how terrible the movie was   i think everybody should watch this  so that then we could appreciate better other  real  movies
