basically there s a family where a little boy  jake  thinks there s a zombie in his closet   his parents are fighting all the time   this movie is slower than a soap opera  and suddenly  jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie   ok  first of all when you re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama  as a drama the movie is watchable  parents are divorcing   arguing like in real life  and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film  i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots     out of   just for the well playing parents   descent dialogs  as for the shots with jake  just ignore them
