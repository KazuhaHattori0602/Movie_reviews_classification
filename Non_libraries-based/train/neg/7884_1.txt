things i learned from  the list   a decent cinematographer  a hot girl who can act and malcom mcdowell couldn t stop this movie from sucking   blockbuster won t give you your money back   even when he reads the script and says  ugh  really  malcom mcdowell still tries   chuck carrington desperately needs acting classes   hire a writer   jesus hates me too and punished me by making me pay     to see this movie   when making a movie  you don t need an ending  just leave everything unexplained  unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep before the ending  genius   any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window  so make friends   your maid can sing you back to life   chuck carrington still needs acting classes   your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie   apologies will not be accepted
