this film looked interesting  i d read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly   started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations  in fact  i didn t bother watching the whole thing  utter drivel   bad performances  bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters   that was the point of the film  i guess   watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend   do not bother with this feature
