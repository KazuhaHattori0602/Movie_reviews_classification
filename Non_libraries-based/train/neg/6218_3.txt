my thoughts on the movie     it was not good  not good at all  visually  it was great  i was pleased with the pacing  the camera angles  etc  however  the characters  eh  kinda bland  plot  it sucked   this movie seemed more new age crap than anything else  organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful  science isn t portrayed any better  it creates a monster weapon that kills everything  but  souls  have the power to destroy monsters and bring life  really   that s something that bites my ass a bit too  here we have a cgi movie  created with science  and they re using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us  at least they had the decency to have one of the characters ask    okay  so now what   or something similar  i couldn t hear it too well because of the crowd immediately getting up and making a break for the exit  it was a  okay  it was just barely entertaining enough to sit here for the entire movie but now let s get out of here as fast as possible  type of exit   this is one of those movies where you can t think if you want to enjoy it  just look at the visuals and nod your head prettily  any thought as to   what s the point of that  will suck you out of disbelief and make you eye the exit sign with longing   okay  spoilers follow   so  basically  a scientist creates  the machine  that is capable of creating other  intelligent  robotic life  evil humans use it as a weapon  however  the scientist realizes that he is also at fault  he gave the machine his intellect  but didn t give it his heart    the machine goes skynet on humanity s collective ass and wipes out all life on earth  finally slowly powering down  however  the scientist manages to survive and create walking sock puppets  each one  containing a piece of the scientist s soul   the last one    wakes up not knowing anything about the world  he sees a strange device nearby and picks it up  he meets up with another like himself      well    gets captured by a last surviving robot of the machine    finds more like himself ands sets off to rescue     they succeed     notices that there is a matching hole that fits the device perfectly  he inserts it and the machine comes back to life  pulling out  s soul in the process   the movie then continues with action scenes with   trying to rescue his soul yanked compatriots    they eventually succeed and destroy the machine  they release the souls of their fallen friends  who go up into the clouds  it then rains and we see life returning back to the planet   hunh   that makes no sense  none at all  why the heck did the scientist want to split his soul into   homunculi  what did it accomplish  were they created to stop the machine  everything is dead  the machine was dead  why bother   why did he expect nine little critters to succeed when nothing else had  why not create a second intellectual machine  but with a  soul  to fight the first  at least that would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance at success   why did they have to have their souls sucked into the device by the machine and then destroy the machine and then release the souls in order to bring life back to earth  why not just wait for the machine to power down and bring life back without all the rest of the insane steps
