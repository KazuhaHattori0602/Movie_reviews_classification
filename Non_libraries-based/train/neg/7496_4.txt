it s difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred i have of this film  but i ll try   every other word was an expletive  the sex scenes were uncomfortable  drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm  if not offensive to italian americans   i m not saying the acting was terrible  because leguizamo  sorvino  brody  espisito et  al  performed well  but almost every character in the film i despised  not since the bonfire of the vanities have i disliked every character on screen
