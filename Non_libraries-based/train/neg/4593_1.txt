as a physics student  i ve become aware of many idiot professors  and other so called experts  in the field  as i continue with my studies  i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on  and about the people who are doing things right   then  my friends tell me of this  physics movie  they want to see  knowing nothing of it  i m excited  hoping that the information will be presented well   i ve done real quantum mechanics  this wasn t it   this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can  and will  occur to you  if you just open your eyes  let s think about that  for just a moment   our bodies are composed of somewhere around  ^  such subatomic particles  that is a million billion billion billion particles  the more  mysterious  quantum effects of just two particles can have a   probability of cancelling each other out completely  as you add more and more particles into the mix  it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result  to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption  with no rationality behind it it s just stupid   my friend  also in physics  and i counted   facts during the course of this movie  but they were presented in the most misleading manner i ve ever seen   i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie  as i have not had any kind of medical training  it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it  remembering my days in biology  but i cannot say   at least this film had a redeeming quality  the dancing peptides  or whatever they actually were  scene  not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie  but the main character goes to a wedding  where she sees all different types of personalities  driven  by their peptides  and then the film cuts to the dance floor  where we are spliced between people dancing  sometimes surrounded by cg peptides  and a fully cg scene  filled with dancing peptides  the film  at that point  was trying to tell us how we re  addicted to emotions  so we re treated to the full song of that smash hit   addicted to love   this scene was redeeming  because anyone who could go through that scene  and still take this movie seriously well  you are the ones that need to  open your eyes
