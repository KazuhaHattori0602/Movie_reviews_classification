summer holiday is the forgotten musical version of eugene o neill s ah wilderness and deservedly so with the broadway musical adaptation of take me along  with the exception of the stanley steamer song  none of the other harry warren ralph blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable    it was right after the release of this film that mgm let mickey rooney go and i don t think it was a coincidence  the film was made in   and released in   so mickey was   playing an andy hardy like teenager  he was just way too old for the part of the   year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion   rooney made four films for mgm from   to   this one  killer mccoy a remake of robert taylor s a crowd roars  love laughs at andy hardy and words and music  in all of them rooney was playing an adult part  even in the andy hardy film  mickey played an adult andy hardy returned from world war ii  why he was in this louis b  mayer only knows    rooney s bad casting makes summer holiday all the worse because in the original ah wilderness the emphasis is on the father s character played here by walter huston  and in the broadway show take me along which won a tony award for jackie gleason  the great one played the inebriated brother in law uncle sid here played by frank morgan and that s the central character   gloria dehaven steps in for judy garland as rooney s sweet and adorable girl friend and marilyn maxwell plays the show girl who gives rooney an adult education  in the original play o neill has her as a prostitute  but this was the hollywood of the code so all marilyn does is get young rooney soused   a lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best  but summer holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn
