a black guy fights   and supposedly wins   yeah     obviously fiction   so we re presented with a damm nice title  a real nice tag line and even a nice plot line   thats about it  thats where it ends  we move into fiction after that   michael jai white  the black guy so don t get confused with the name  portrays a black guy  umm  thats all there is to the name   its so hard to find decent help  must have hired the black guys friends to help cause the low budget  low ineptness of this movie  has the camera s shadow trailing the first scenes  yeah obvious idiot moment for the average guy like you and me  but yeah     lines  review submitted  if you paid to see this movie  you got screwed
