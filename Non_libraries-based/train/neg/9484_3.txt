if i have to give this movie a score on a linear scale  then i have to give it a low score    but it was entertaining  and there are several good things to say about the movie   the psychiatrist candidate james bishop is assigned to st  andrews hospital for his resident  and is exited and eager to  change the world   from the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth  but james thinks he can make a difference and doesn t recognise this evil    the story builds fairly well  you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil  and wonder when and how james will discover this  also when the break comes  james is in a way hunted by the evil  and you feel some suspense until  the fight  is over   add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements  and you get the picture   the character buildup is actually fairly good  you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed  some of them you  get to know   the film sets an unpleasant scene  this is also done fairly well  there are mysteries that are unveiled   in an acceptable way   the main character  james is very believable   the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting   what kills this movie is    stupid special effects   a modern version of  plan   from outer space type bad  the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow    some bad acting  or probably very few takes when filming    the main characters sometimes acts badly  and somtimes good    the sound is at times very cheap   i kept thinking  i could make a movie like this with my home video camera  throughout the film
