 and an extremely bad one at that  how long did this train wreck last    episodes or something  i can see why now   i bought the  serenity  episode from amazon unboxed  it was my first purchase  so was free  that is the only good thing about the experience  incident   i won t comment really on the acting  since these were  i guess  fairly new people who hadn t really gotten the job down just right yet  at least i ve never seen them before in any type of major show  theater or tv  if i did  then i have easily forgotten them   but the special effects were absolutely horrendous  true  this isn t exactly a multi million   project  but the original star trek did better than this   that was thirty five years ago  i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys  reapers or something like that  ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly  with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket  i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top  while chasing after the roadrunner  modern jet rocket engines don t even do it that bad   and that wasn t even the worst of it  the wild west type shoot outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci fi film or a gene autry one   regardless of the hype  don t waste your time i did all  something minutes of the disaster called  firefly
