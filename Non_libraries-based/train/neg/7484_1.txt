within   minutes  my whole family was rooting for goldie hawn s character to die  or at least for steve martin s character to leave her  at   minutes  we turned it off  there are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we can t even stomach it long enough for the story to get established   normally i like both steve martin and goldie hawn  and i remember enjoying the neil simon original  so i blame marc lawrence and sam weisman  combine the director of  whats the worst that can happen  and the writer of  miss congeniality   and i guess this is what we end up with
