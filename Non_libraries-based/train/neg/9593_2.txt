judging by some of the comments in imdb  i was expecting an action movie   perhaps a dramatic one or a stupid one or a simple one or a comicy one  but essentially an action movie   whatever it is that i watched  it certainly didn t feel like a movie  the story is simple and straightforward  even though the prologue tries to make it seem complicated  take three interest groups    the government   the rebels   a group of assassins   now subtract the first  they never appear in the movie  then simply let one of the assassins  the princess  become a rogue on a revenge trip  add in a rebel love interest with a guilty conscience  and you ve got the ingredients   but they still did not manage to turn it into a story or a movie  between some random action sequences and some odd visuals trying to be sci fi on a low budget  what you re left with is a feeling of emptiness  the movie just does not feel like a movie  but a weird  incoherent  boring dream   avoid
