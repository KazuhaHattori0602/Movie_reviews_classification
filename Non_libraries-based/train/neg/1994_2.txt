this film  originally released at christmas    was long thought lost  a very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a cd  now for sale  don t buy it  the film is unspeakably terrible  the casting is poor  the script is awful  and the directing is dreadful   picture roland young singing and dancing  and that was the highlight   perhaps this movie was lost deliberately
