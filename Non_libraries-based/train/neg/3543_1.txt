been lurking for a couple of years or so  i have never been moved to post on here before  so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that  but i doubt it  i just watched it on dvd  having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now  i had not read extensively about it  certainly not even thought about the movie in some months  it was just what the buddy picked up in the store  so it got watched   bad mistake   the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster  right from the off  jason statham has hair  like in no other gr movie  or any js movie that i ve seen  at least not in the quantities on display here  and ray liotta in underpants should be advance warned  it s scary and funny but not in a ha ha humour way  its more in an almost theoffice but slightly mutated and so failing sort of humour way  they each say the same thing   this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be   now  based on previous  extensive  movie watching experience  i expected this movie to be a few things  like     coherent     interesting or engaging     not a complete and utter farrago of navel gazing     something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a  cool  modern  self aware art form     hopefully better than  the idiots   as you may have guessed by my tone  it thoroughly failed to check any box above  instead it was    x  badly edited  pace all over the shop   s amateur high  style jump cuts  incomprehensible  plot   twists  delivered through hackneyed flash back montages  i could go on    x  shot as if by a depressed  yr old goth who d just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drapes drawn   x  so up its own behind with the whole  i m really smart  me  motif  message  that it feels determined to repeat it every   minutes or so  just to make sure the dumb people  ie  everyone who doesn t like it  in the audience make sure they get the point    x  a genuine waste of my time   as for the undoubted ability of some people to  get  something from this  fine  i m glad you enjoyed it  one poster said something that caught my attention  under s probably understood it better because of the editing  maybe  but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible  not less  as for the  genius is only recognised by the enlightened  brigade out there  go suck an onion and grow up  there is nothing more presumptuous and self serving than people who say the reason another person doesn t know great art is because they don t understand the  craft  materials  moon cycle  filaments of supreme rational thought  which the  auteur  poet  artist  palm reader  idiot savant  is using to explain his or her  vision  grand scheme  oneness with gaea  great big bucket of dog sick   for me and many  many more people  its garbage    movies  art  stories  poetry  anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving  in some direction be it metaphorical  spiritual  emotional or whatever you re having yourself   the only way this moved me was forward in time  two hours closer to my own inevitable demise   the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all   and now  please  by all means  toast my buns for me
