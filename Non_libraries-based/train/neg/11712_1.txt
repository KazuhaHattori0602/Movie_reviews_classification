the only reason i remember this movie is because it was  and still is  the biggest waste of time and money ever spent  i was   and my friend was   we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most  ok  nd most  we walked out feeling so insulted  we wanted our money back  but the time could never be regained   the editing is what killed this movie  as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in  x  vw bugs shooting rockets at the truck  please  rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium  what s worse is the these vw s manage to get   shots off of a   rocket launcher  you would see on vw with   rockets fire   of them  cut around the truck with the last one attached  come back a second later with two rockets attached  fire another  then go in front of the truck and now it s back to a full set of   rockets   we toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened  it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped   just ridiculous
