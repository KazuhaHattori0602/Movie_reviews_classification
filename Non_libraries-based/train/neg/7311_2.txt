okay i had heard little about this film  so when it came on the movie channels on tv  i wanted to watch it  being a horror aficionado  i think i can do a collective  huh  for everyone who watched it   i decided to move on with my life  but at a party with my closest friends  we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it  both of us proclaiming  this is the dumbest thing i ve ever seen  it wasn t scary  ill give it to roth  who i think is a young hack  characters do change throughout the film  ala  cube   however despite your typical  rats in a cage  scenario  who will turn on who  etc  it was pretty average horror   a few points    what was with that kid  i m not even talking about him being weird and biting people  i m talking about the whole  slow motion karate kicking  what was that    okay i know rider s character liked jordan ladd s  but as a young woman  i was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep  uh  thats illegal     roth was in the movie just so roth could be in the movie  talk about pointlessly writing yourself in    what was with the deputy    so she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog  and there was little to no blood left  just a scrap of her jeans  anyway we were laughing our asses off  and i love laughing during horror movies  return of the living dead   evil dead  but i don t know if we were supposed to be laughing here
