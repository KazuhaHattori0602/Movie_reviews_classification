spoiler alert well i think this movie is probably the worst film ever made  probably in the style of ed wood without the heart  the lightning is terrible  the music is very bad piano and orgue  come on  the acting is  well there is no acting   there s a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger   the killer is a fat  unscary clown who couldn t outrun a turtle   every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clich s of slashers movies in the film without effort   the end is so far the most stupid ever made  think about it  the guy ken hebert  who s acting skill is about the same as his writing he s the brain behind this flop  invite a co worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week end and kills them  on monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen   the tragedy is that mr hebert try to make us beleive that it s a family affair that goes on for generation his uncle is the clown killer   so of course no cops are gonna question him after his co worker goes missing   whatever
