this apology for a movie is about absolutely nothing  rachel griffiths must have needed the money  the film must have been made on a very low budget  because the lighting was non existent  i made a vow if i ever see pete postlesumthingor other i ll commit suicide  i d be happy to know if there was   a plot or  a script  my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish
