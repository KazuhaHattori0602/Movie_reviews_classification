i can sum this movie up using   words or less  way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face  see    words  however  i didn t completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m  my advice  take the   rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck  or you may want to send me the   replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice
