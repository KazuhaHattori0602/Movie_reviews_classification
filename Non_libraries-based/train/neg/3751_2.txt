i am a huge fan of david lynch  this film  however  was a quite disappointing experience  apart from the ambient background music   which really sets the mood of the film   it lacks almost all the qualities that i ve come to associate with lynch s work  the visuals are dull  to say the least  and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest   this feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director  i ve seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera work  scenery  sound and script  this film lacks almost all artistic qualities  i feel as though i m watching one of davids home videos  produced during a weekend trip with some friends
