when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following  the united states of america with its population of   million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside  it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra  conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated   on a per capita basis europe  britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america  it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society  by doing so greenstreet  deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie  this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and clich  idealist left wing ideology  this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition  greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies  the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy  movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash  sensationalism at its worst anti  usa garbage shameful
