it s hard to believe an  action  packed jet li movie could be so boring  but this was transcendant trash  the plot is an amalgam of other hong kong chopsocky flicks  the martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent    it s a comic book story about a group of super human soldiers who are to be killed because they re mentally unstable  one of their number  li  who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian  the saved killers resurface with an austin powers quality plot to take over the world  and li sheds his new life to save the world   the version i saw was dubbed  and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer thin plot and comic book   cent special effects  but i suspect even ninja turtle watching  year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow
