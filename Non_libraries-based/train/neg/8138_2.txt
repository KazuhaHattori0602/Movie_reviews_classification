 the bat people  is a proud resident of the imdb bottom   every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list  depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars  but it always reliably returns sooner or later  and why  because  unlike the majority of crap in that list   the bat people  is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz  this nearly isn t the worst film ever made  since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity  but it s still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing  the script is incredibly boring  with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity  and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film  other than a sensible screenplay  the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make up effects   although courtesy of a young stan winston   are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film  the film s title is inaccurate  as  people  refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person  much more than bruce wayne  the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat cave and a bat mobile  a stolen ambulance  the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon weekend exploring caves  they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal s vicious attack  worried that he might be infected with rabies  he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital  but still this doesn t prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature  he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment  sure  honey  the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat guano  so basically   the bat people  is a variation on the good old werewolf theme  but obviously not a very interesting one  the concept showed a lot of potential  but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters  some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive  the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy  there s a nice bit of gore during the climax  finally  and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at  though not to listen to  this truly bad and boring film s current listing in the bottom   is spot number   and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region  the list simply wouldn t feel and traditional without  the bat people
