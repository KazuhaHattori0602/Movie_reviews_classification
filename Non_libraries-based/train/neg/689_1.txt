what the   is this   this must  without a doubt  be the biggest waste of film  settings and camera ever  i know you can t set your expectations for an  s slasher high  but this is too stupid to be true  i baught this film for   and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back  can you imagine who hard it stinks    who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations  well actually  you couldn t possible care less  and why should you  the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn t care  they didn t try to create a tiny bit of tension  the director   stephen carpenter   i guess it s much easier to find money with a name like that   also made the kindred   wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors  complete crap as well  but at least that one had eliza dushku  this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga     who     yeah that s right  the melrose place chick  her very memorable character dies about   min  after the opening credits  she s the second person to die  the first victim dies directly in the first minute  but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares   the rest of the actors they don t deserve the term actors actually  are completely uninteresting  you re hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their characters  my humble opinion
