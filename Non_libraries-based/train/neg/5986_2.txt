to say that thunderbirds is a horrid  forced  in your face  ugly looking  nasty to listen to and painful to watch film wouldn t be saying enough  there are only two reasons i can think of why you d watch this film    you ve seen thunderbirds when you were young  like i did  and are curious as to what it is like but you will really only be watching to find out how badly they screwed things up  or    you re seeing it with someone under ten years old   thunderbirds manages to cock up everything it attempts  the list goes on and on but there are other more subtle  humiliating things that are painfully obvious when you think about it  from the off  thunderbirds is wrong  wrong  wrong  the whole moral message and  goal  is set up in an excruciating way  jeff tracy  a new low for bill paxton  tells his youngest son alan he s not yet proved himself to be a thunderbird after alan randomly and stupidly decided to go down into tracy island s bowels to fire up thunderbird one  the whole film is then a series of events and miss fires consisting of alan trying to prove himself whilst his father and other brothers are trapped in space aboard thunderbird five   the film relies on kid actors to carry the film  a   year old alan tracy  corbet  a   year old tin tin  hudgens  and a   year old fermat  fulton  who is brains  son  to say that watching the  adventures  they get up to is painful is an understatement  frequently trying to act and utilise the script whilst combating the evil  hood   kingsley  in ridiculously unfunny and hammy ways acts as the entertainment for the duration of the film  it only differs when everyone s in a different location  also  the whole  mind control  thing was very tiresome and basically dragged the film down as it was overused and offered a way for our heroes to see a weakness in the hood   forced and incidental   i know that most  film s for kids  these days try to integrate some sort of material for adults but in thunderbirds it s done in a way that fetishises lady penelope  sophia myles plays penelope and i think it s no coincidence she s a little older than the rest of the kids   at   years old  it s almost too good to be true  her scenes are often highly charged and carry an erotic push  we see her in the bath  bubbles up to her neck watching tv  in comes her butler and sneaks a peek as she seductively changes channels with her wet  bare and bubble covered foot  frequent shots of her massive  bright pink high heeled shoes filling the screen during various scenes  this first happens when she is actually tied up with the second happening during a fist fight with another woman  twinned with this  her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh  dominant  english accent  sounding like a commanding mistress  well  she is lady penelope after all   and you d better make sure call her that  the whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won t notice but it sure as hell is there   the actual plot of the hood doing all that he does just to rob a few banks is very bizarre  the characters that are his bodyguards  a geeky looking woman and hard bodied black man who gets agitated a lot  are we supposed to be laughing at this  what about the fight scenes  poorly choreographed stunts and what the hell was with the silly noises  it s utterly  utterly laughable   the list goes on  the way bill paxton plays it all so seriously  like he was told they were doing it one way but it was made another  the way ford motor company have their logo slapped all over the place  news bulletin  sponsored by ford  the camera even moves to endorse ford several times when cars are in shot  the way the cgi looks like something out of a computer game video clip   it s infuriating  the fact we are told to believe that a   year old girl can swim in the freezing thames  against the current  rescue a downed monorail  monorail over the thames  get back to the hatch and thus  save the day all the time holding her breath  it is absolute bull and the makers know it   i don t even know if a   year old would swallow it   in short  avoid  avoid  avoid  thunderbirds is infuriating  unfunny  poorly scripted and even the rolls royce was taken out and replaced by a flying car   everything that could go wrong  did go wrong
