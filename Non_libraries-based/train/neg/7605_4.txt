i guess that  gunslinger  wasn t quite as god awful as most of the movies that  mystery science theater   shows  but westerns just aren t roger corman s forte  portraying rose hood  beverly garland  becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies  the movie is pretty predictable  john ireland is rose s new hubby  secretly working for unctuous allison hayes  yes  the  foot woman  also appearing briefly is frequent corman co star dick miller as a mailman  miller nowadays stars in joe dante s movies   i do wish to assert that you ll probably want to watch the  mst k  version to really enjoy this movie  they had a great time with it
