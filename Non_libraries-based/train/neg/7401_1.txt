 sigh  leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea  blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool  lordi is a mediocre band at best  and a single gimmick will get you only so far   to all you marketing idiots out there  this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when finland tries to export something   lordi isn t scary  lordi is lame  lordi is over   i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic faced idiocy  sure  they won the eurovision   no  wait   they won the eurovision  that s it  i rest my case
