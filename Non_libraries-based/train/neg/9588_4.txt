 absolute beginners  was a film for the younger generation  a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled  constantly hitting each note  teen s problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow  it could have been dubbed the  moulin rouge  of the  s  but it disappeared  it made its very shallow mark on the world  snuck under the radar  and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section  the comedy section  or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn t need chain money to survive  alas  that wasn t where i found it   but i found it  watched it  tried my hardest to sing along with it  stared into bowie s eyes  but found myself faded by the end  did it not survive the test of time  is  s london too far removed from our current society  is bowie too creepy  i think  absolute beginners  falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang  but withers to a mere sparkle by the end    absolute beginners  opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly  prostitutes on every corner  dance throughout  booze like rivers  and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual  sounds like a place we would all hate to be 
 right  director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters  the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl  suzette  played by patsy kensit  these two have chemistry  and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan  to me they worked  there was a huge spark between them  the chemistry was like lava  and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled  i was ready   but then  something happened  temple takes us out of the nightlife  takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning  and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first  suzette runs away  colin becomes a pervert  and bowie 
 well 
 i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain   i can tell you that much  temple gives us this flashy city  this opportunity to see those that inhabit it  but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger  we learn about colin  mainly  but nobody else  i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom  and what importance fashion had to that era  also  were they teens really   they all seemed like they were pushing their late  s  but maybe it was my tv   character development thrown right out the door  temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger  more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about  one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example  temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin s parents  of which i didn t know it was them until after the film  and a song which screams apathy  great song  too many characters  not enough time  suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency  and it just falls apart in your hands  then  if that wasn t enough  we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs  rubbing our noggin  trying to understand where our characters are or are going  and temple throws in hatred  anger  and politics into the final act  while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme  i didn t think racism would be on the top of the bill  suddenly  friends are missing  people are angry  and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race  somebody help me out here  it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming   nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off  to me  the ending of  absolute beginners  was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number  that first part set the pace  and temple could not keep up   overall  i must say that temple can direct a music video  but i don t think he was quite prepared for the feature film  i don t think this film will ever make it into full  cult  status  and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come  it is a fun film to watch initially  but when we get to that final part  it just explodes from the inside  i wanted some cutting edge work  but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for  i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the  s  but by the end it just felt forced  i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to  motivation  by the ever freaky bowie in this film  it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status  i am glad that i watched this film once  but that is all that my small brain can take  i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning  but he couldn t control his characters  way too many  and the songs didn t seem to match the final moments of the film  it came out of nowhere  and it was unwelcomed  if this was a film about racism  it needed to be from the beginning   absolute beginners  was a welcomed adventure  but i don t think i will be dusting this film off in the future   grade    out of
