i had a recent spectator experience with the perfect witness   because the netflix computer recommendation engine suggested i watch this film  apparently  at some point  i told it how much i liked michael haneke s  benny s video  i don t know about you  but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over thomas c  dunn s film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse  just this kind of recommendation from the netflix computer intelligence  for me  had the aesthetic moral movie bar set to level so high that  upon reflection  it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year    having prefaced my response to the film that way  i m going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal  and i really hate to do that because i think our boy  wes bentley  happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema  but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the us  i m more than moderately concerned that the poor guy s going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this   the perfect witness is about micky  wes bentley  who  about thirty  still lives with mom  you re not drinkin  again area ya s  but he s a  filmmaker  or at the very least some kind of street level voyeur with a pension for shooting would be johns in the seedy back alleys of philadelphia with his dvx  b  out there  doing his private investigator like drills  micky  inadvertently  video tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early twenty ish coed with his hand held camcorder  baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto  and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films  micky approaches the assailant  james lemac  mark borkowski  also takes a writing credit  or  mac the knife   whichever  and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses  holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police   the problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do  while both the writing and direction are amateurish  that alone doesn t make a film bad  it s that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little mac or pc  no film relies on shock value alone any more  unless of course  ironically  it s a film about torture on animals  and therefore cinematic images of violence  real or fake  have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes  also  we ve got this astounding actor talent in the lead all styled up  real hip guy  his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it  backwards  just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest  same guy who just now calls himself a  poet   spare me   i m an artist   i m a filmmaker  okay  please do  carry on with that shtick  cronnie  seems to have bought you a lot of expensive  mm stock  and go ahead  you can wear all the accrutements of a  creative  but don t expect us top respond to you  to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down wes bentley s career  why don t we just let history speak to the merits of what you do  filmmaker guy  my guess is history will eventually have say something about that  like  probably that s in not is good as you think it is  and yeah  odds are you ll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma  end up like our man micky here in the perfect witness  hooked on smack and covered in your buddy s blood with a video camera in your hand  great
