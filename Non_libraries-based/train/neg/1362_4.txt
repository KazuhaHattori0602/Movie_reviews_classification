maggie smith and peter ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all   the film shows promise for ustinov is released from prison for embezzling  he convinces robert morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by karl malden and bob newhart  another unusual duo for films   morley sounds just as he did in  s  marie antoinette  perhaps  he needed to return to that genre   this film is ridiculous at best  hard to believe that the following year  maggie smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering oscar performance in  the prime of miss jean brodie   ms  smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb red head  but by film s end  she is the brains of the outfit  too bad the writing didn t go the way with her
