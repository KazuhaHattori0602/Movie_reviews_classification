many things become clear when watching this film    the acting is terrible  tom hanks and wendy crewson are so so  but the parent child conflict borders soap opera ish  the other two boys  an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical i m a babe but i m really sensitive inside blonde dreamboat    the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing    robbie s dreams and episodes are disturbing  acted by tom hanks    the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice  we are all special friends    the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting  and   this is a really bad movie  expect to be disappointed and probably disturbed
