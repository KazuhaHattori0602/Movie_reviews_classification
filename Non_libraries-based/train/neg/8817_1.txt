no  i ve never seen any of the  santa slasher  series  i e   silent night  deadly night  the original  black christmas  or this one   christmas evil  i ve heard all about their reputation  or  mads  mothers against deranged santas  i thought i would rent this one as i ve heard it pop up as a reference on a  fat guys at the movies  segment   mothers should be against this  but not for the ooooohhhh  killer  santa  but for the fact this movie was just plain crap  boring  long   even at only   minutes  crap   little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in   deliver presents  eat some goodies and miraculously  float up the chimney  boy goes to bed  but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa  sort of  getting it on  apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life  though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphie s dad got the  leg lamp  in  a christmas story  he was sooo disturbed  he went to the attic and  well cut his own hand   fast forward to the future  now  it s   and messed up boy works in a toy factory  we get a whiff of him being a little off kilter  and he stalks both kids and parents alike  who s naughty  who s nice  blah blah  it takes a good two thirds of the film to get him to finally snap   as if that s not foreshadowed from frame one  no movie should take that long   i will admit  this movie had its tension building  but only because i kept expecting him to do something  anything to anyone  when he finally does  well  punish  who s naughty  it s as graphic as a  garbage pail kid  card  and i haven t mentioned the wtf ending  i m thinking it was a metaphor  but in reality  it s just as weird as the rest of the movie   take the brother who s upset his sibling is killing  and his solution is
uh  killing  don t open this mess  even on christmas eve  or evil  again  i didn t watch the other  santa slashers  but this one sucked bad  it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present
