i really hope that concorde new horizons wasn t trying to make a serious horror  or even action movie when they made carnosaur   the movie is flat out silly from start to finish  even the humor in c  is funny because it s bad  definitely a high water mark in the  so bad it s good  genre  if you enjoy the very worst of the worst  this is for you
