i disliked frosty returns and this one  both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices  the voices could have been done but frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew  frosty s winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming drama  the only good thing about this film was frosty the snowman was alike of the classic  s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then frosty walks by the window humming  whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and i barely got the plot  i saw the dvd cover at the library about   or   years ago and the art looked crappy so i didn t pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but i played this film  it was a hassle poorly art characters just like the dvd and it was just terrible about what s going on  i watched this at night and found it dull that i fell asleep on the whole thing  wait i always do that when i watch something while i go to sleep  but this movie was overall boring  overall rating  grade  c  this is like another holiday special bad rip off in the frosty returns and this one  this one is the badly  th sequel like home alone   well i thought that movie was ok but home alone   was great  but it s like a bad home alone   and   people hate like this  my sister didn t watch it that much because when she came into my room to watch   minutes and a half of it  she walked away like  i hate the animation  i agree to her just like the  rd one frosty returns  plain awful
