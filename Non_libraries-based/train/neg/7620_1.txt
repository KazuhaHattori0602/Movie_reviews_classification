i rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my horror this movie was the worst movie i had ever seen  i read the comment from gumby  and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew  unless gumby  is a   year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all   i couldn t believe gumby s comments    quoting   from the  dune  inspired opening animation to the quick pace this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected   the animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving  well that s because you keep looking for any type of suspense  i mean give me a break halloween was shot with a budget of   and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic  as far as  repeat viewing is not unexpected  i think he made a typo   another quote from gumby  the only fan   the acting is also a strong aspect of the film   with all due respect for the actors  their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of robert napton   the catchy tagline   beware the hour between dusk and darkness   that s because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie   mpaa rating  rated r for some violence gore   the only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see  as far as i know it might be a clump of grass   in summation  i have seen horror flicks from the  s   s and  s  i have seen what i thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good  the director of this film either did not make any attempt  was asleep  or took a hit of acid  whatever the case i think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction  i would give this film a rating of   for a  b  movie
