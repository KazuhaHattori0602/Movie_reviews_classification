ritchie s first two films were snappy  stylish entertainment  here  he raids two recent classics    the usual suspects  and  fight club    and still comes out empty handed   despite parading itself as a con mystery  with the sub usual suspects  twaddle  the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you  or whatever it was  and attempting a  fight club  twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations  the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half  by the last third  you know you re being lead down a blind alley  and tediously slowly at that   cons  chess and game theory are all great subjects  but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material   the only thing that keeps the movie  almost  watchable is ritchie s bold way with with a scene and maurice jones s dynamic camera  if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot  and succumbed to tighter editing  there s no reason why he couldn t have made another enjoyable gangster caper   as it is  revolver is a waste of your time  incomprehensibility does not equal profundity  if you want to see a great film that doesn t make logical sense but makes a virtue of it  and  incidentally  which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement  watch  lost highway
