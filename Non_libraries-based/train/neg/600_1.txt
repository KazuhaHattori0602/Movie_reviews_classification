 in a horror movie that is  alright first off   lets start with kate  her main goals include getting laid by george clooney  looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over  gotta love her  she had about   amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but   instead she ran  i mean she didn t wanna bring guy out for   minutes and when she did it was too late  i mean the guy tried to rape her  i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot  i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night  the movie kept going on  and as a result lost all its credibility
