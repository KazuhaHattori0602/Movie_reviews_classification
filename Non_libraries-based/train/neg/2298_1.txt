here are some examples of pat robertsons dubiously claimed  relatively good track record  on predictions  in his widely reported comments from the january   edition of the christian broadcasting network s the   club  during which he predicted that there would be  very serious terrorist attacks  and  mass killing  in the united states in the  second half  of   host pat robertson boasted that he had  a relatively good track record  on earlier predictions  but a review of robertson s   new year s predictions undermines that claim  he predicted  for example  that      president bush is going to strengthen  wrong     the fall elections will be inconclusive  but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the republicans in charge  wrong     the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion  we ll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year  way wrong  further  as a january   associated press article reported  robertson has a history of making dubious predictions   the broadcaster predicted in january   that president bush would easily win re election  bush won   of the vote that fall  beating democratic sen  john kerry of massachusetts  wrong  in   robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term  he said social security reform proposals would be approved wrong yet again    he claims to speak directly with god  if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again
