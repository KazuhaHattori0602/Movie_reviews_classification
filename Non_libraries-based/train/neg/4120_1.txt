absolutely horrific film  ameteurish and it isn t funny at all  lead character played by mehmet ali erbil is very annoying  edits by e t and star wars is just plain stupid   actor yilmaz goksal is the only good think about this movie  he should master his english and move to hollywood  hollywood can not find an actor with his qualities  other than goksal this movie is a garbage   director gani mujde is a comic writer and this movie is his worst written work to this date   music of cem karaca is another plus of this waste of money  actor sumer tilmac also have some presence  actor who plays the three sons has no talent what so ever
