i really don t get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it  even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of   minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus    first of all  surely they could have   found real irish people  and some good looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up  haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film  granted  the gore works  but strangely  it s not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars  hot  formerly  tight bodies left and right  probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain   so  if you don t care at all about the following      acting  seriously  everyone sucked  i ve never witnessed this before  everyone sucked    plot  some crappy horror movies are remotely linear  or at the very least surprising  this movie doesn t make sense unless you re as trashed as the writers obviously were      theme  nothing to learn from this film  nothing to be scared about in bed at night  nothing to contemplate or grasp  or explain to others      soundtrack  crap  crap  crap  music as ordinary and dull as the script      scenery  could have been this film s saving grace  but no nothing pleasing here  even the rocks are fake   so  yeah  if you don t care about that  and you re just a horny teen with bad taste in music and  women  this movie is for you  positive comments  interesting cinematography at times  wasted on the other elements  very realistic gore  again  wasted  but the intestines scene is classic  i agree with the mutant  disembowelment solves the fake accent problem
