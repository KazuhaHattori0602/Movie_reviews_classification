i saw this on tv the other night
 or rather i flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when i couldn t stand watching it any longer  it was bad  really  really bad  not  so bad it s good  just flat out bad  how did it get funded  who thought this was a good idea  an actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he wasn t good enough to play a bad guy but i think what they meant was  save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of   i bet the rest of the cast had been given the option  to be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake american ascents  the shooting was dullllllllllll  the action was awkward and stilted  the dialog was inane  by far the saddest thing was ship  in real life the interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it doesn t scrub up well  instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls  i kid you not  they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness  dumb  dumb  dumb  don t watch this movie  not even as a joke
