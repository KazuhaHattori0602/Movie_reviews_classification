perhaps one of the most overrated so called horror classics ever made  halloween does feature the memorable michael myers and some great acting by jamie lee curtis   however  its rewatchability factor is very close to zero  as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness culmination to the actual events   this is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all   how it spawned so many sequels  i will never comprehend   thank god rob zombie is remaking this  and generally  i hate remakes   surely he will more than compensate for all the random time filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks   this is a movie we feel we have to like  much like the way we re taught that we should enjoy dickens   don t assume this is a classic
