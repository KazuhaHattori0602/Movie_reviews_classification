i just saw  if
  i can remember the advertisements for the movie from   so i was interested in finally seeing it  it may be the perspective of an american who never went to a british public school and misses some of the social references  but i thought the movie was awful  for one thing  as others have pointed out  it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed at the time revolt to break out  for another  whether the last scene is real or imagined  what occurs isn t a revolt  but a shooting rampage  there s quite a difference   i know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events  but one cannot avoid doing it here  one person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at columbine high school and virginia tech  but if there s a scintilla of difference between klebold  harris and cho on the one hand and travis  malcom mcdowell  on the other  i simply can t see it  all four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f___ ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for   which brings me to  why the hell are travis and his chums even in a school they so despise  they are adults  or close to it  they re not in a military prison  like the inmates in  the hill  a much better british film from about the same time  no one is forcing them to go to college and take beatings from the the whips  except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake up about the nature of their sons  i had the opportunity in college to join a frat  except i couldn t stand to be given silly  cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective  brothers  i took the consequences of not having the  in  with the establishment that frats provide  and i can t say i regretted it   if travis fancies himself the second coming of lenin  whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room  he s free to go out and organize a fitter s union or work for michael foot in the next election  if he wants to be jack kerouac  then get on the road and start writing  what possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room   sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in  last tango in paris  where brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes  in the real world  the person said  a listener would say  why didn t you scrape it off  change your shoes   don t allow fictional characters to lay a self pity trip on you because you don t dare point out an common sense alternative course of action for them  so it is here
