went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the jet li we were amazed by in lethal weapon   unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it  the flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you couldn t see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for   seconds and   kicks   too cartoonish and very disappointing
