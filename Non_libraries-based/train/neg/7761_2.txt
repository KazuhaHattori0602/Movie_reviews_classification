after a series of power outages on a remote island zoo  genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island  man  the sci fi channel has made some bad  original  movies  but i think this might possibly be their worst so far  this badly written and directed  jurassic park  rip off offers all the usual clich s  mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are  expendable losses  characters walking down long dark hallways alone  brain dead teen characters who s only function in the film is to die a horrible death  etc  and  unsurprisingly  no suspense whatsoever  the special effects are atrocious the puppet heads in close ups of the title beasties are bad enough  looking like stiff plush dolls  but the cgi which makes the computer generated dinosaurs in  walking with dinosaurs  look life like by comparison are just downright awful  there s some gore  but most of it looks pretty unconvincing  oh  and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things i ve seen in years  i couldn t even laugh it was so bad   don t waste your time  this one is just downright bad       oh  and here s some interesting trivia for you this film borrowed music cues from the   sci fi film  alien hunter  which was far superior to this piece of crap
