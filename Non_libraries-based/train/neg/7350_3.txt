despite pretty bad reviews  i just had to give this film a go   it does  after all  star hk super babe shu qi plus   other oriental lovelies as a team of all action cat burglars  surely that s worth checking out  well  as babe fests go  martial angels is hard to beat  the eye candy is top quality  shu qi looks as fantastic as always  and of the rest of the girls  rosemary vandebrouck and amanda strang caught my roving eye in particular   unfortunately  if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits  it is an absolute stinker  the story is weak  the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic  director clarence fok and producer wong jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else   if shu qi is the only reason you re contemplating seeing this one  you would be better off watching sex and zen   again
