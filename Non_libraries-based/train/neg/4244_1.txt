contrary to my principles  let me first come up with a conclusion  because i have just seen this piece of  art  and still am under strong impressions  the reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary   well  this movie is absolutely horrible  and i would never bother to write a single word about it  if it were not for the fact that   minutes  made me sick to death  which rarely happens to me  the fact that i paid for that does not exactly makes me feel better  as well as the fact the movie deserved the high user rating here   so what is wrong with the movie  it has a fashionable title     minutes  one first thinks about   minutes  which is by the way a much better movie  but still bad in my book  and indeed the two can be compared to some extent  but  as luck would have it  the things they share are their worst characteristics  they both feature mr  oleg taktarov  who with his strong russian accent obviously meets the popular expectations and prejudices  his purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind  ah  do we miss the good old times  now  i don t imply that he is a bad actor  i am yet to judge his true performance  but he is simply not a true individual here  he is more like an archetype  how anyone can still indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension  we can recognize modern american xenophobia here  the point in the movie when taktarov explains to his companion that romanians are not germans  and that they are in america is truly laughable  are we to assume that the greatest desire of the wretched duo is to become  true  americans    then  there is the media issue  yes  it seems that the most of what we learn comes from cameras  interviews and reporters  the director should have made us feel the rhythm of the presumed   minutes  instead he bores us with interviews throughout the movie like in a cheap tv show  trying to reinvent the wheel  in   minutes the issue of media is the central one the point is presented in a way a teacher addresses an obtuse student  but that deserves a separate comment  we are focusing on   minutes now  so  i have been trying to identify the purpose of this movie  what is it  to provide good time for the audience  to glorify weapons  to glorify police  portray violence  oh yes  the officer gives the bible to the underage delinquent  so it must promote peace and understanding after all  i don t think so  but don t ask me  i only know i didn t enjoy any of this   ah  michael madsen  i admit  i am a big fan  i hoped he would be a bright point  but i was wrong  it s not his fault though    as the final note  comparing  firepower  to  willpower  at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines i have ever heard   to summarize  on the scale   i give it a pure  unadulterated
