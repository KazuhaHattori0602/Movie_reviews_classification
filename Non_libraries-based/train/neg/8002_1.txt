what a terrible movie  rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too  don t be fooled by the positive comments  it wasn t scary  it wasn t funny  it wasn t clever  it won t even hold your attention  i just wasted   hours of my life viewing this crap fest  the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times  after about   minutes it no longer entertained  the dialogue was terrible  must be a translation thing  another negative that stood out was the idiot americans    were portrayed and they were all lacking character  intelligence and judgment  now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have   the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter
