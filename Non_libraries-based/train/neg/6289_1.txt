this is the most cliche ridden and worst romantic comedy i have ever seen  every scene is cringe worthy and the two lead actors   corey and danny are soo annoying  corey is very dumb and naive and should have never listened to danny s false promises   neve campbell and the killer from urban legend are the only redeeming qualities in this poor attempt of a film  danny  dean paras  looks in his late thirties and the girl he s trying to bed   corey looks as if she s still in college   here in australia  this film is called too smooth  there is nothing smooth about this film at all    avoid
