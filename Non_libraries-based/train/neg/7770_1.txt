this complete mess of a movie was directed by bill rebane  the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti classic monster a go go  as i was nearing the end of the cold i came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that  s shocker  the story   such as it is   is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games  whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win   it s a very simple plot but rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible  things happen  characters are completely forgotten about  nothing makes too much sense  and then it ends  weirdly  i mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly  i guess you are left to draw your own conclusions  production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard  in truth pamela rohleder  shelly  isn t even that good  she is so unbelievably terrible she s compelling  sadly the same thing cannot be said about this crap fest as a whole  it s just a bargain basement rotter
