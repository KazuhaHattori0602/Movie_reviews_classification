as a huge fan or the cracker series  i have been waiting   years for the next addition  this episode i m afraid just does not live up to the legend   fitz returns to manchester after   years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation were a soldier  tormented by flash backs from his tour of duty in northern irland  goes on a killing spree   what i did not like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is all set up and how fitz is led to the murderer  it is all fat to far fetched   there are however some good scenes in flash backs from northern irland which are filmed great
