this was a truly bad film  the character  cole  played by michael moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped  the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil  it didn t  after about   minutes i had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance  this would have added some sincerity       badly acted     unsympathetic characters     razor thin plot line  yuck
