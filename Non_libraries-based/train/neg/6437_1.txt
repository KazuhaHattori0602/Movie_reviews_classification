spoilers   first off  nothing really happened in this movie  other than a woman bleeding inexplicably  second  it wasn t scary  third  it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever  let me elaborate  the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead   i m not sure which  so let s just go with beavis  the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter  forcing you to turn up the volume  i watched this at home  then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary shocking images  forcing you to quickly lower the volume again  this occurs many times until  mercifully  the movie ends  i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time  if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep  this one is a big mistake  but then it s a big mistake anyway  here s a thought   if you re going to make a horror movie  at least add a gratuitous beheading  a  year old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater  the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range  a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience  some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh  or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil  a la tv s lost in space  these people didn t even try to scare me  they just wanted to hurt my ears
