i love the depiction of the  s and  s in film  i love salma hayek  i was more than ready to love this picture  but        booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo             no sir  nothing good about this  the only entertaining aspect for me was colin farrell s character is an insecure writer and this screenplay  despite tackling the juicy subject of racism  approaches the audience in the fashion of an abc afterschool special   the only person who didn t sound like he was  acting  was sutherland  and his minutes were few   stale approach to a tired plot
