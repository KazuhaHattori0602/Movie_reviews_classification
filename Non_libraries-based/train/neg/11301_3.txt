nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction  this is the case with  the mummy s tomb   the script is leftover ideas from older  better universal horror flicks like  dracula  and  frankenstein  the direction is trite and stale  the acting is mediocre  even chaney s kharis is feeble compared to tom tyler s in  the mummy s hand  and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from christy cabanne s vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film   universal realized how bad this movie was  and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as  the mummy s ghost  with a much better script and better director  the result was likely the best film in their four film  mummy  cycle  although not anywhere near as good as karl freund s   original   cabanne s footage raises this film to a   the  new  stuff is a   at best  dick foran and wallace ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn t have to appear in dreck like this anymore
