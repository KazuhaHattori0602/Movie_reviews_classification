a phenomenal achievement in awfulness  it s actually hilariously awful   first off nicholas cage must now have made it to the finals in the over emoting category in his acting class  wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a  hero  character that you have no vested interest in   i don t know what it is with neil labute and female characters  he makes females out to be totally deviant and evil and pays them back by having cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all  b es  a few times too  i ve enjoyed labute s early films and a few of his plays but it s a strange fascination he has   i d give this film a   out of   solely based on ellen burstyn s performance  by the time she finally makes her appearance  bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead  it seems like all hope may be lost  she deserves an oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue  white  and gold face paint booming about the wicker man you know that working with scorcese and friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well   this movie is so wrong headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed   highlights include  nicholas cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill   nicholas cage stealing a bicycle and looking like ms  gulch from the wizard of oz riding around on it   nicholas cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl   leelee sobieski plummeting from a once promising acting career in a  brawl  with cage   ellen burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu   nicholas cage screaming  who burned it  who burned it  who burned it who burned it who burned it who burned it  for no reason   nicholas cage in a bear costume  i m not kidding  running through the woods  taking off the costume  but leaving the bear feet on  and then doing some karate moves to some villains   and you haven t lived until you have seen the final   minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin s basement   needless to say  if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal  there was actually a point in the movie where i stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this wasn t an elaborate send up of  hysteria  films only to be reminded when cage would scream shout whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously   i think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again just because it s so dreadful
