over the past year  uwe boll has shown marginal improvement as a filmmaker  cranking out the competent  in the name of the king   a  lord of the rings  clone  and the proudly vulgar  post  satire  postal  but then came  seed  and the counter was reset to zero  keeping his bid for legitimacy and respect that much further out of reach  and i m a fan of the guy his films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision  and are never dull   spawned from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received   seed  is a colossally misguided attempt at social commentary  and an even worse jab at creating an iconic slasher mythology  boll often seems to be taking a page from rob zombie s successful reboot of  halloween  the antagonist is maxwell seed  will sanderson  a mute  hulking brute who s slain   people and sits on death row  awaiting execution  after unsuccessfully frying the beast  he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem   trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason voorhees  max seed is too nondescript and boring to leave an impression  ultimately resembling a washed up pro wrestler doing  the toolbox murders  on a succession of equally boring victims  furthermore  seed s character and boll s  message  run contrary to one another  the death penalty is wrong  sure  but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who s left a couple hundred corpses in his wake  i think not   meanwhile  michael pare acts like a listless  long lost brother to james remar s character on  dexter  a cop who sits at his desk a lot  thumbing through newspaper clippings  and watching pointless stop motion scenes of decomposing animals and people trapped in seed s lair  by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm seed s hideout  the sequence is so drawn out  ill conceived  the lighting is almost non existent  and unexciting  despite a healthy dose of gore  that it almost put me to sleep   the shoddy film making isn t limited to just that sequence   seed  appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer  since the camera bobs and weaves endlessly  a technique that s more stomach turning than the gore itself  these protracted takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering  almost non existent narrative  at   minutes  the film is distended enough to be considered a form of torture  which might have been boll s intent all along   pure genius i guess the joke s on me
