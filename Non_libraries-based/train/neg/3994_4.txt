i am a huge  huge fan of john cusack  samuel l  jackson  and tony shalhoub  i m slightly less fond of stephen king  but i like some of his work   this said  i should have loved     possible spoilers after this point    i walked in eager  i walked out disappointed   this is not the fault of the actors  shalhoub and jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the movie puts cusack in the  guy in a locked room  scenario   this wasn t a bad movie  but i can t call it a good one either  it was a muddied mess that had moments of  ouch  that s just wrong  combined with moments of  ouch  that s just painful  and moments of  oh  now that s just unfortunate  with very little continuity connectivity between them  eislin s father shows up once  and there s no seeming connection to the rest of mike s personal life that we see displayed while he tries to survive the room    a previous commenter described the olin enslin argument as worth watching  and i very much agree  but other than that  aside from some clever musical cues  the room almost playfully torments enslin a little bit  and gives him one chance to get out before upping the ante at which point it gives him the one hour countdown clock and the titular line from the carpenters  we ve only just begun  it s mostly  stuff jumps out at you when you least expect it  type horror that was fun when i was fourteen  and surrounded by friends my age  clutching each other in the summer while jason stalked camp crystal lake   the rest of the movie was  let s make him relive some of his most painful experiences  mindgaming  with  let s animate the paintings in creepy ways  clich  cheesiness    end spoilers    i expected better from this movie with stephen king s name attached to it  as well as the actors i mentioned above   we never find out the origin of the evil  we never get to see the evil defeated  though we can presume maybe it was defeated   and the ending was just a jarring  what  moment   wait for it to come on cable  i wouldn t have minded paying for it as a matin e  but i m feeling a bit shortchanged for having paid opening night prices for it
