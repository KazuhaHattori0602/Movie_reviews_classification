i was looking forward to this ride  and was horribly disappointed   and i am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides   the roller coaster part was just okay   and that was all of about   seconds of a   second ride    it was visually dull and poorly executed    it was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior indiana jones and space mountain rides and disneyland  and failed in every aspect   it was not thrilling or exciting in the least
