spooks is enjoyable trash  featuring some well directed sequences  ridiculous plots and dialogue  and some third rate acting   many have described this is a uk version of   and one can see the similarities    the american version shares the weak silly plots  but the execution is so much slicker  sexier and i suspect  expensive   some people describe weak comedy as  gentle comedy    this is gentle spy story hour  the exact opposite of anything created by john le carre   give me smiley any day
