 minor spoilers    i am  like many others  a huge jerry bruckheimer fan  so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front  and the trailer coming by before mi  expectations were rising  a jerry bruckheimer production  big cars  nic cage and fresh from an oscar  angelina jolie  what can possibly go wrong  a lot    the script is neither funny  which it tries really hard to be  nor exciting  you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and wooh haa  you ve got comedy  i don t think so  excitement is totally out of the picture  first of all  and this is probably said many times  there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed  if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nic s brother unless he steals   cars in   days  next thing you know is that kip  the brother  is walking with nic in the streets again  is this excitement  think not  then comes the best bit  the romance between nic and angelina  she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic   do you have a girlfriend   are you seeing anybody   what went wrong  etc   then there s only one sparkle of hope left  the car chases  they re disappointing to say the least  because the trailer made it look like it was full of them  and there s only one  a very long one  caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement  i really had trouble following the action   so is it an action movie  a thriller  a romantic comedy    there s no need to decide  just avoid this horrible mess  i ll give   out of   stars  and i feel like i m being generous
