for starters  i would like to say that i m a fan of the american pie series  even though  the naked mile  and this one are the two worst  this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series   first of all  the best part of the film was that it was an american pie film  which is always appreciated   however  there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film  first of all  the story has a very stale  arc  structure  first  there is the introduction of the characters  then the pledging of the beta house and finally the greek olympiad  each of which has exactly   minutes of length  apart from the general staleness of the plot  there is little to no character development  which makes a double whammy of a bad plot   apart from that  i deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film  that is  showing the jocks as the extremely cool  only thinking about sex guys  and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior  also  it shows females only as sexual objects  and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects   apart from that  the acting was also poor  with perhaps the exception of steve talley   so  in the end  a generally horrid film  if seen from a critical point of view  if seen from a teen point of view  i guess that it s better  but this film is rated   in most countries  so it shouldn t really be seen by minors
