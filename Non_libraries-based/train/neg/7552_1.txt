the wicker man has done the impossible  it replaced cat woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind  yes it s really that bad  so bad that when sitting down to write this review i thought to myself  if i had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes  i might actually go for the red hot needles   neil labute created a rare movie where joel schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind  yeah that s some bad direction right there   i think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line   some sacrifices must be made  sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen  trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment  seriously  the movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and i would still rather with be stuck on gilligans island with only pictures of condoleezza rice then find myself stranded there   the most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart i ve ever heard in a movie theater  that s not a joke nor is it fictional  i ve never been to a  thriller  and heard so much laughter through out the entire film  i can t tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly  i honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater  anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since deez  powder and i pounded   beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia  soon to be a law before all nic cage films  write to your congressman today  don t delay  at one point i actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and anna ferris is going to show up
oh how i wish   nic cage throws out so much ham per frame i m thinking of having a cholesterol test done today  to think that i ever thought sean penn was a d ck for slamming nic s acting  oh he s still a d ck just lesser of one
yes sean penn s d ck was lessened because of this film  do us all a favor nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks  you cannot play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect   dollars  his best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit  like the fart  not a joke or a functional moment during this review  then proceeds to run amok like conan o brian s masturbating bear  but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around  thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he s to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of burning man and lilith fair  yes  i just spoiled the ending for you
and if you knew any better you d build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend  i sat through this crap fest so you don t have to   about half way through this little misadventure i kept thinking to myself jack bauer would have wrapped this case up in   minutes of real time ok   minutes if kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first  even steve martin as inspector clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour
and you sir are no inspector clouseau   if for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet  take the bullet   somewhere uwe boll is laughing at us all
