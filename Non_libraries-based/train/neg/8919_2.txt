i first saw this when it was picked as a suggestion from my tivo system  i like danny elfman and thought it might be interesting  on top of that  i m a fan of max fleischer s work  and this started out with the look and feel of his  s cartoon  with both of those  i thought it would hold my interest  i was wrong  just a few minutes in  and i had the fast forward button down  i ran through it in about   minutes  and thought that was it   afterwards  i read some of the other reviews here and figured i didn t give it enough of a chance  i recorded it again and watched it through  there s   minutes of my life i m not getting back   i can t believe there aren t more bad reviews  personally  i think it s because it s hard to get to the   line comment minimum  how many ways are there to say this is a waste of time   the movie comes across as though it was made by a few junior high kids ready to outrage the world and thinking they can with breasts  profanity  and puke jokes  the characters are flat  the parody of  swinging the alphabet  is lame  essentially cobbling the tune  getting through a   e  hitting the obvious profanity a  f  and then having no idea where to go  the trip through the intestines to the expected landing doesn t work the first time  let alone the following ones    across the board  the entire movie is what you would expect from someone trying to  out south park  stone and parker without the ability to determine what is and isn t funny  this might be amusing if you re high  otherwise  it s not
