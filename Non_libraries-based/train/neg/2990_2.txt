ohhh man  now this is what i m talking about  as far as bad cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own  a real gem   first off  the film wasn t originally in english  that s okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional  here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog  and there is plenty more where this came from 
  i m feeling a little better  i m just thirsty
 for your blood   and what drama  here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists
  scene  
 scientist   you can t do that
 it ll be a disaster    military officer   that s just science fiction   he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted   scene  
 scientist   if you do that many people will die    military officer   you don t know what you re talking about   he does it and many people die   scene  
 scientist   don t do that
 it ll kill everyone    military officer   that s nonsense   he then proceeds to kill everyone   scene        
  you get the idea   if that wasn t enough
 there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics  in one scene  the military has literally   guys pointing guns at two unarmed men  the leader yells   go get  em  and all   army guys  one at a time  drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries  instant classic   and don t worry  no attention to detail was left out  this movie even had a hip upbeat  s keyboard synth soundtrack to set the mood   and trust me
 i realize this review might contain some spoilers  but there are so many goodies in this epic i really only scratched the surface  a movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade  a true movie watching experience  a masterpiece  wow
