the first few minutes of  the bodyguard  do have a campy charm  it opens with crawling text from the bible  the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in  pulp fiction  continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind  who is better  sonny chiba or bruce lee  and then chiba appears  playing himself  he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand  unfortunately  any entertainment value  intentional or unintentional  soon gets crushed by the disjointed story  the lack of action for long periods of time  and the poor quality of any present action  to keep it simple  here s why  the bodyguard  is an unbearable movie to watch     you don t know what s going on      there are barely any fights      the fights that are there  are short and terribly filmed   sonny chiba is cool  judy lee is gorgeous  her face is glorious  it s only for them that i give  the bodyguard  a  nd star out of   this movie makes   minutes feel like   hours
