the plot of corpse grinders   is very much similar to the original corpse grinders  what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens   it is my belief that this film would be the   worst film on imdb   if anyone had actually watched it  the plot is disconnected and  in several  way too many  instances  makes absolutely no sense whatsoever  the real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous  but still somewhat better  film   i would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh
