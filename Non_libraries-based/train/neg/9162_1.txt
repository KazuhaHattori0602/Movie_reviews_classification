the only reason that this movie is rated a   is that zero is not one of the selection options  with a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup  horrific acting  and special effects that look like they came out of the  thunderbirds  tv series  it is amazing that widmark didn t kill the director for putting this black mark on his resume  even by  s standards  the special effects are atrocious  except for a couple of underwater submarine sequences  i can only assume that it was nominated for best special effects because  except for   leagues under the sea and them  there wasn t anybody else doing effects  it was certainly no contest for disney that year if this was their only competition  i wouldn t recommend the film  even for hard core submarine movie buffs  as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to one shot where seawater can be seen dribbling down the up raised periscope  there are other  much better  sub films that you can enjoy from this era  like the aforementioned   leagues or torpedo run
