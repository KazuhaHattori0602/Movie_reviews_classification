you probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie    herbie  fully loaded with crap  and yes it is true  this movie is really dreadful and totally lame   this got to be the second worst movie lindsey is ever in since confession of the teenage drama queen  the only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie  i don t see how such a respected actor like matt dillon could be a part of this movie  isn t he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it    what i didn t like about this movie is also base on how herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a beatle  i know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining  little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable   final words  unless the kids are actually     years i highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie  what wastage of my money  i feel like cheated   rating     grade  f
