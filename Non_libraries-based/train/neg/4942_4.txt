every new fall line up show deserves  at least  my   strikes and you re out  policy  i give a comedy   chances to make me laugh  that is    complete episodes  after episode   i actually said to the tv cancelled tomorrow  it was that bad  i have now watched the first   episodes of  cavemen  and have yet to manage even a smirk  not a titter  a guffaw  a chortle  as a matter of fact  no facial movement at all  i will continue to punish myself by watching every future episode because i am convinced that i am clearly missing something in this show  i m simply not  getting  it  but i believe that a comedy on a major tv network in prime time  just has to be funny  but there are no laughs from me yet  there s just no way that abc would put on the least funniest comedy of all time at   p m  i know there has got to be an inside joke that just isn t jiving with my brain  i ve read each of the previous comments  i  get  the social aspect of it  but  where are the jokes   i shall continue suffering for at least   minutes a week  until i have a light bulb moment and smack myself in the head shouting  eureka
