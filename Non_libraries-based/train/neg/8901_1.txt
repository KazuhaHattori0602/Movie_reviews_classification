i ll make this short and sweet this movie sucked   i watched part   earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever  gave it   out of   stars  so i thought perhaps part   and   would be good sequels  i was wrong  this movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one  it had the plot continue and thats it  it was like bad outtakes from part one or something   i love walken  but i felt sorry for him here  i was so happy about glenn danzig being in this film  but don t blink you ll miss him  there was a full cast full of crappy actors and people i don t like such as eric roberts and jennifer beals  however  it was a breath of fresh air to see ethan embry  he s one of the funniest people on earth   this movie will make you like the first one a little less  so don t watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself  being a fan of part   i am gonna wait a few days before i watch part   and i pray it is better than this crap   the last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film  fast forward or skip to that if you can t stomach the first part     out of   stars   this was awful
