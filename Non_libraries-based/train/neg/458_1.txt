what is this crap  my little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie dvd art and title  i decided to watch it with her so she didn t get bored  and i sure was appalled at the horrible quality   first  the acting was terrible  they seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards  the delivery is sub par and very formulaic  scene cuts were terrible  it looks like they took it straight from the story board  if there was one   secondly  the jokes and stereotypes weren t original or well played at all  again  very formulaic  i can t count the times i was able to predict the next joke  i got a few chuckles out of the blatantly  subtle  sexual innuendos  the cat  the beaver patch  hung wong  c mon  just  stay away from this movie  it s not cute  it s not funny  it s not even stupid funny  it s just stupid stupid  it s like a pg kids  movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo  vulgarity  and violence to bump the mpaa rating  stay away    would you like to ride my yacht    is that what they re calling it now    you could ride my ding    oh  i think i got blood on my stool   badly played  sir
