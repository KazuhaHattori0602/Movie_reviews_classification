i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch  i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutson   i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was   the plot  people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely  and nobody has a clue what the cause is   only health worker mike brady has a possible solution  but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities   only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all   this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie  slugs in this movie are fast  then normal  and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes    this movie is nothing like the book at all  the book was ten times scarier  ten times gory and had a lot more story to it   i didn t like this movie at all  as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground  both of books are great   read the book then watch the movie  you may like more then i did give this   out
