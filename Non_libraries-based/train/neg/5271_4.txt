a bickering  american family  vacationing in the west  discover a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert  little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs  and a deadly presence is stalking them  i generally love mystery horror films like this   cube  spielberg s  duel  and  the birds  are all great examples of movies that give no answers but nonetheless leave us intrigued and wanting more  apparently   disappearance  writer director walter klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film  and whether or not he succeeded is up to the viewer  i personally think he got about half way there  then the film just sunk   the actors are all kind of just  ho hum  their not especially bad but we as an audience never really feel their fear and they react to situations in unrealistic ways  is anyone else absolutely sick of characters just walking out off to investigate strange sounds  at least give them some kind of justification for doing so   as far as made for tv films go it s an above average fair for sure  director klenhard should be commended for really milking the desert environment for everything it offered and some of the setting were striking  there s a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test ground were the sand had been completely melted to glass for as far as the eye could see  i wonder if that was real
  no gore to speak of  and the  creatures 
or what ever the hell it is that s after these people
are never shown  not to mention that we are never even given a real clue as to what they are  mutants  aliens  ghosts or ancient evil indian spirits
oh  that really narrows it down for us  or where the come from    there are lots of clich s here  too  why is it that towns folk in these kinds of films are always really  really dumb  why is there always an old guy everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct  why  why  why  how  bout a new scenario  folks     disappearance  tries to be different and intelligent but ultimately fails in that in many ways it s too familiar to us fans of direct to video horror fodder  hey  i ve seen much worse films  and disappearance ain t bad  it s just too
