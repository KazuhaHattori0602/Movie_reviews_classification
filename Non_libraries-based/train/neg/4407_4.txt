the basic premise of  miami golem  most definitely deserves a spot in the top  say  fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down  i know top   doesn t sound too impressive  but i ve seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots  i was prepared from something convoluted  because the film was directed and co written by alberto de martino  who was one of italy s most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers  de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters  like most italian directors did around that time  but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex  confusing and overwhelming  not all of de martino s films are worthwhile  but some of them are extremely underrated  like  a special magnum for tony saitta   holocaust   and  formula for a murder  the concept of  miami golem  contains elements from numerous great sci fi and adventure flicks  like  alien   starman     close encounters of the third kind   et  
  but i wouldn t exactly call it a rip off  the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to harold faltermeyer s axel f  from  beverly hills cop  the rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy  sci fi  action  horror and superhero movie gimmicks  it certainly doesn t always make sense  most of the time it doesn t  actually  but  miami golem  is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finish   the plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but i ll try anyway  sceptical journalist craig milford is reporting the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial dna inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it  the dna cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size  if this isn t problematic enough already  the rich mr  anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination  with the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise  craig milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus  okay  i know all this sounds grotesque and silly  but i assure that  miami golem  is in fact a light headed and easy digestible flick  the first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing  because alberto de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings  there are subliminal ghostly appearances  supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of atlantis  this is all misleading padding material  however  and as soon as the set up is more or less clear  miami golem  turns into an ordinary early  s popcorn action movie with bloody massacres  flamboyant chase sequences  in the florida everglades  explosions  gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetus monsters in jars   now  i really don t want to raise the impression that  miami golem  is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema  make no mistake  this is a pretty bad movie  the events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you don t succeed in that  well than this is just a non stop spitfire of negative aspects  the acting performances are painfully awful  particularly b movie veteran john ireland  as the archetypal james bond villainous character  doesn t seem the least interested in the script  you can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck  laura trotter is probably the least sexy female lust object ever  and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way  because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie  what an embarrassment this must be for mrs  trotter  still  her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this  as she s quite hot from the neck down  and  finally  there s the unforgettable scene where david warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol  i don t think even john rambo can do this  while he s a beefcake vietnam veteran and warbeck s character is a simple tv reporter
