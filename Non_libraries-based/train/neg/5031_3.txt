the original   japanese film  gamera    was essentially an updating of the darker  less kid oriented gojira  godzilla for  s sensibilities  gamera  of course  is a giant  flying  flame throwing turtle who literally consumes energy   not quite as big as some versions of godzilla  but generally similar in most ways    this version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious sandy frank  and just like the americanized version of godzilla  godzilla king of the monsters   gammera the invincible  gets more than just the spelling wrong  the american scenes are not nearly as ludicrous and annoying as those added to the great gojira  but don t really add much to the story either because there is little follow up on them    the film starts off promising  there are a few scenes worth of character development  and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot  once gamera appears  however  the film begins to descend into a fairly run of the mill kaiju film   the acting is good enough  even the american add ons are ok  the directing is pretty good for this period and genre  and the special effects are not bad at all for their time  all miniatures  some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good    the biggest problem here  of course  is that there is little to nothing original about this film  gamera  however  develops a much more unique personality in his later films   most of which are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan
