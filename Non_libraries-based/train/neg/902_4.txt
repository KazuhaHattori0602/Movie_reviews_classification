i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film  she was   years old when the film was made in    i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia loren s early work  i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess  surely  today  this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making  it actually became annoying watching ms  loren in skin color paint throughout the film   yes  this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie  then  the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent  i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight   as beautiful as ms  loren was at age   and still is today  the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage  after all  we don t see beautiful young people on stage with  old opera singers  back stage singing from behind the curtain  do not discount the success of using heavy weight opera singers  one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j  g  wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company s product  this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date   the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality  the color ink has faded much and that can not be helped   to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we  who do not speak italian  can know what the lyrics are saying  it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving   seconds of introduction to the scenes   watch this film not because of the story of aida nor the fact that this is an opera  aside from ms  sofia loren none of her co actors are known nor remembered by this writer  instead  watch this movie if you are a fan of ms  loren and wish to see her at age     no matter what the production is   larry from illinois
