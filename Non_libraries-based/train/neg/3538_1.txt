after seeing  driven  on a plane flight to america   years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created  and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again  unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case  revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it  just so i don t feel like i m the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this  its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant  and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters  with totally inane pretentious nonsense  i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin s utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film  whilst all the time thinking   what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster con man  whatever he s supposed to be  when he made his  offer  i ll tell you what  he would have told him to f k off  blown his head away  and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him  i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake s head when they offer him their  solution  to his problem  they re con men  therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases  i mean ffs  doesn t he start to wonder why his symptoms aren t getting worse  doesn t the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he s been conned    anyway  i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides  thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films

  bulls t  this film doesn t try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines  oh no  it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didn t hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema   and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get  and not   person so much as smiled  maybe he never wanted the film to be funny  and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy  but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask  the unnecessarily baffling plot  i sincerely hope not   by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end  it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over  and they were free from their torment   i ll round this off  i ve got to finish  writing this is making me angry again  by elaborating on the  end  i mean sh t  the ending
  no  sorry i can t  your just going to have to go and see it  it can t be put in words  it just can t  and after you ve seen it you ll know why  uuhhhhh   shudders
