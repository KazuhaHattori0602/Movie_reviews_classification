i saw this film in its entirety in the  s    s  yes it is gruesome  and could be the progenitor of the  faces of death  series popular in the  s    s  considering the state of so called  driver education  these days  this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive  when you see violent death in all its gore   horror  you certainly  if you have any sensibility at all  get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely  what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do  i worked for bell telephone in the  s    s  and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class  i found this film in the company library  showed it at the session  a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room  incredibly  most of them later said  i never knew a car accident could be so terrible  this film  and another   red asphalt  is certainly reality in its most graphic form  i ll never forget it  i only wish i could have found a copy when my children were attending  driver s ed  in high school
