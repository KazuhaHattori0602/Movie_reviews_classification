this is a terrible film  and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion  the characters are uninflected  obviously drawn  predictable and the story line is obvious and typical hollywood wish fulfillment   william holden  so sad to see him in this role  was   when this film was made  but he s playing someone in his early  s and looks like he s in his  s  kay lenz was   and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive  i think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection   holden s character the same age as clint eastwood when he directed this film   not  coincidentally is placed with obvious trappings of  s pre hippie cool  the bachelor pad  the swinging hi fi  the lunches at yamashiro  but the film is ridiculously uncool  a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on sunset and in laurel canyon would find them and their big honkin  cars sexy   ugh  youth culture was never that desperate  and i shudder to think that bill holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part
