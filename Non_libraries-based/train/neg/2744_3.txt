i was bored  around  pm  so i watched this movie  and i could not stop laughing  everything was so ridiculous  the way the kids were acting like they were older than   just cracked me up  one of the kids had a ring  that supposedly killed people after   or so years  it gave me the impression that he wanted to be a gangster   it s pretty hard to take little kids seriously  especially when it has to do with eating worms  they act like everything is such a big deal  like if billy  the main character  doesn t eat the worms then the world will end   this is a good movie for little kids  excluding the fact that a   year old says  penis  but not for teens or adults who don t want to waste their time
