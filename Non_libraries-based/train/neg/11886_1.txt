watching josh kornbluth  act  in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class  where the  not funny  had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were   obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy  the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed  the delivery is painfully bad  ouch  the writing is simply dorkish  it is akin to a bob saget show    watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit  post belushi    i hated this movie and want my money back
