i recently watched this again and there s another version which is shorter   i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference   one is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with  ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice    prof ivy was rather boring  she sounded as if she was almost asleep  no expression at all with the few lines she had   this was enjoyable enough but there wasn t much to it at all    a collector  whos after lugia  he has no plan to destroy the world  and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destruction   the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better  deoxys  poke   is great  with no    almost here
