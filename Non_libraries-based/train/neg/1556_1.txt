i was china in this film  i choose the screen name sheeba alahani because i was modeling at the time in italy and they couldn t pronounce my real name correctly  so i choose sheeba and then added alahani since it was similar to alohalani   i had never acted before  and it shows  but it was so much fun to film  they gave me  acting lessons  each morning  which obviously were not useful  they dubbed my voice  thank goodness   david and peter were a blast on the set  full of good humor and jokes  this film was never meant to be taken seriously  it was a tax write off according to inside information    i give it a   because i have a sense of humor  but a   for the fun i had  acting  in it
