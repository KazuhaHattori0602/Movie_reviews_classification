with its companion piece masters of horror  nightmares and dreamscapes can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with the twilight zone and the outer limits   of course  part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience  instead aiming at ten year olds  who are only able to count body bags  and scarcely that  and so grossness is king  and king is grossness   stephen king is simply illiterate   in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of bart simpson  since he cannot read his sole inspiration is the movies   true  the cinema is not such a bad place to start  since it has generally escaped the onslaught of  realism  but these films are only the rumor  not the thing  and if you want to write  you have to dig deeper   of course  only pickman had monsters as close acquaintances  but even so  it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not dracula and lugosi   at least autopsy room four is a clear indication of what is wrong  one can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something scary   not  mind you  trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part  making the stupid stupider  but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew  suppose  you were paralyzed  and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things  wouldn t that be gross  and that  boys and girls  is the story   what about characterization  oh yes  he s one of these suits  who never really appreciated life  you know  and now it s too late  right  and he s shouting   well  they can t actually hear him  you know   he s saying that he s going to sue the hospital  but he s not such a big shot anymore  you see  lying there  or is it laying  i can never remember  and all  and he s thinking  oh no please  please don t cut me and this is terrible  lying  or laying  like that   now  wouldn t that be a great story  you know i read somewhere that a snake bite can do that  i think it was that great medical authority agatha christie  what was the name of that snake again  oh yeah  a boomslang   has quite a ring to it  doesn t it   let s make it a peruvian boomslang  sure  steve  that s great   except that boomslang is afrikaans  you moron  but how can you really tell that the target audience is children  and not simply mental defects  it s easy  there s no sex   well  there is  but it s the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent s bedroom  modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre  the monster  the female victim  the chase   but unlike universal and lewton they have no idea what s going on  all that s really left is the giggling outside the sm club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil   in spite of a certain discrepancy in size  king kong knew exactly what to do with fay wray  freddy krueger can only kill her   and since there s no real titillation in that  he has to torture her first   not in any way that might excite her  you understand  since that would upset our puritan sentiments  and so  horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths   our hero  you see  is a rubber fetishist  and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know   rubber gloves  giggle  and that s what they use in autopsies  and that s how they discover that he is  in fact  you know   obviously  this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers  too bad  they cut it out  since it might have upset the five year olds watching the show
