whoever wrote up  redline  as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming  steaming pile of amateur crap  easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made  this makes showgirls look like citizen kane   take every cheesy clich  out of an  s action tv series  put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business   this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever  what offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap
