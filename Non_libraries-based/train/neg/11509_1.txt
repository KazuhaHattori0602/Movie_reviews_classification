i don t know what some of you are smoking  but i suspect it s potent   to call swept away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness  the acting is hideous and i m not picking on madonna here  we all know she s useless  but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious  my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines  the editing is so sloppy  it beggars description  the photography and composition  which in this era  competence should be a given for any film with a budget  are astonishingly inept  even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking  these are basic elements of filmmaking  if you can t get them right  you should seek another line of work  it s as contrived as a grade   production of snow white  except nowhere near as well made or interesting   the original film by lina wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor  superbly acted and written  featuring breathtaking visuals   you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair  the sexual tension feels real and immediate those of you who found guy ritchie s version deplorable  should see it  it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema   those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined
