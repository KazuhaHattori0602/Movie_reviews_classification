this serial is interesting to watch as an mst k feature  but for todays audience that s all it is  i was really surprised to see the year it was made as   considering that fact alone makes this a solid  lowly    in my book  the cars used don t even look contemporary  they look like stuff from the  s  it s basically cody  the lone world s salvation  sheesh talk about an insult to everyone else  like the military  anyway it s cody in his nipple ring flying suit against graber and daley two dumb ss henchman who sport handguns and an occasional ray gun thats pretty lame in its own right  enjoy  if you want to watch a really good serial see flash gordan  it s full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and also good looking women  this has none of that  and flash was made   or so years before this crap so you can give it some slack  something made in   this bad  deserves a   nuff said  give it a   if your watching it as a mst k episode  those guys have some good fun with it  a tweak of the nipples here  a tweak there and i m flying  and now as an added bonus  i bring you the commander cody theme song as originally sung by joel and his two character bots tom servo and crow aboard the satellite of love for episode eight the enemy planet    singing at the very beginning credits    tom servo singing  your watching commander cody  he is the new character from republic   he gets in trouble every week  but he s saved by editing   just a tweak of his nipples  sends him on his way   a pumpkin head and a rocket pack  will save the day    joel singing  his labratory is a boxing ring  when bad guys come to mix it up   somebody always gets kidnapped  and cody has to fix it up   he drinks his tea at al s cafe  and flies along on wires   he beats the crooks and flies with hooks  and puts out forest fires    crow singing   bad guys beware  cody is there   you ll like his hair it s under his helmut  and because we can t think of a good rhyme   that s the end of the commander cody theme song  so sit right back with a will of granite   and watch chapter eight  cause that s the enemy planet
