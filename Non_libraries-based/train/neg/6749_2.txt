this mess is so bad it doesn t even qualify as horror    debbie rochon s talent is completely wasted in this film  she is not even the villain  the rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame i won t even mention it   do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band twomarlowe perform  better than sex  it s total  s disco candy song  nice up tempo song about gambleing   sex  way more entertaining than  bleed  put it this way  when one has the equipment to copy videos  but decides only to record the song at the end of movie  you have a really  bad  movie
