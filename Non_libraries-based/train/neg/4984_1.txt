the original  les visiteurs  was original  hilarious  interesting  balanced and near perfect  lv  must be a candidate for  worst first sequel to a really good film  in lv  everyone keeps shouting  when a gag doesn t work first it s repeated another   times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny  lv  is a horrible parody of lv  except of course that a parody should be inventive  if you loved lv  just don t see this film  just see lv  again
