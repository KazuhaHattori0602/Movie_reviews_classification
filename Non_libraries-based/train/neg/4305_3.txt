i saw this film a while ago on a video cd   i will  st mention the good points   the movie  at first  at least tries to appear that it is not biased  like not showing one character as black and the other as white  both main characters are friends and co exist very well in an country and economy that is not booming while at the same time not failing  their families get together and have parties and they practice their favorite sport  sport rifle shooting  as comrades not as competitors   but  after the  st   minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road  the audience is expected to believe that for some unknown reason these friends must hate each other  that for some unknown reason bosnia is now on a path to conflict  sure  the script adds in tv footage which the characters appear to be watching live news programs in english  but the clips are from   not   when the war began   the history  the   elections  the people who caused the war are not mentioned  the movie tries to place the blame with karadzic  who had been a presidential candidate and leader of the bosnian parliament s  nd largest party sdp  according to the constitution of bosnia  the sdp was to have the presidency in   but there was a coup in january  the bosnian islamic democratic action party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in march in which it declared itself the law in bosnia and announced secession   the history of the idap begins with bosnian muslim alija izetbegovic  a man suspiciously absent from  stth  he was a student of nazism in ww  he even wrote his own  mein kampf  in which he stated   it is not in fact possible for there to be any peace or coexistence between  the islamic religion  and non islamic social and political institutions   in   he lost the idap elections to  pro yugoslavia moderate  fikret abdic  a bosnian muslim  that worked with christian serbs during the civil war  and who treated his supporters like brothers  abdic was prevented from taking power by izetbegovic  who lost the elections but seized the seat of power   the events from above are missing from the movie  but they are the factual events that lead to the war   there were problems with props too  serb soldiers in the movie were wearing soviet ww  helmets  which they did not use  also the one soldier was holding an m  ww  rifle only used by ussr not yugoslavia   the director and script writers had a chance  but they chose to re write history
