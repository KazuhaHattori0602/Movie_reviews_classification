i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier martinez in swat  but this is no swat  swat had a plot and some likable characters and made sense  bullfighter had none of these    i should have realized that it couldn t possibly be any good  after all  the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role   one poster here called the movie incoherent  another called it the worst movie ever  both gave the movie far too much credit  i am so glad i got it from the library for free  yet i still feel ripped off   imdb needs to include a   in the  rate this film  vote  just for movies like this one
