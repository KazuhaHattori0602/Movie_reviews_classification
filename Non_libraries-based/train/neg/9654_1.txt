the movie is plain bad  simply awful  the string of bad movies from bollywood has no end  they must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies  or not   the problem seems to be with mainly the directors  this movie has   good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance but they were directed so poorly  the poor script did not help either   this movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half  for instance    after his  st big concert  ajay devgan  meets up with om puri  from whom he ran away some   years ago and talked to again  and all om puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with salman  what a load of crap  seriously  not to mention the baaad soundtrack  whatever happened to shankar ehsaan loy   ajay devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar   only saving grace are the good performances in the second half  ajay shines as his character shows his dark side  so does salman as the drug addict    watch it maybe only for the last half hour
