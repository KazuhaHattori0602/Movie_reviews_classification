tainted look at kibbutz life  this film is less a cultural story about a boy s life in a kibbutz  but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general  in the first two minutes of the movie  the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves  and it s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical  kibbutznikim  besides the two main characters  a clinically depressed woman and her young son  every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well
evil    the story centers on how the kibbutz  like some sort of cult  slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows  there is no happiness  no joy  no laughter in this kibbutz  every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny  hypocrisy  violence  cultism  repression etc  for example  while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking   year old boy   his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his  jewish  physical appearance and brutish personality  he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother  he treats these volunteers like trash  after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn t seen in a long time due to his military service  he orders  quote    linda  go take shower and i cum in two minutes    there is one other  good  character in this movie   a european foreigner who plays the mother s boyfriend  when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother s son  the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist s arm  he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for  violent  behavior against one of the kibbutz members  more hypocrisy  the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age   or without love and gives an account of the actual act that s supposed to be humorous for the audience  but is really just stupid  she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse    the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult  children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders  the mother apparently can t  escape  the kibbutz  although in reality  anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose  it s a mystery how the boy s father died  but you can rest assured  the kibbutz  drove him to it  and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless  wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son    that s the gist of this movie  one dimensional characters  over dramatization  dry performances  and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience s head   that kibbutz life was degrading  miserable and even deadly for those who didn t  fit in  i feel sorry for the guy who made this film   obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz  but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
