the back cover of the dvd  missed this one when it came out  hails hitler  the rise of evil as  a triumph   the new york post  and  mesmerizing   newsweek   well never mind the post but really  who ever wrote that word in newsweek in the same context with this peace of  ahem  art should be sacked   i don t no where to start with  why try to paint the picture of hitler s evil with colors that did not exist  he was evil alright  but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate  compared to his love of animals  the gentle and subdued way he treated women  and so on   the actors are good  so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one dimensional characters  some kind of curse here with peter o  toole  this is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie  or in this case tv production  to be accurate  the first one was of course the legendary galigula   the list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the   words allowed by imdb  so i think i ll leave it here   this one is ok if it s on telly and you don t have anything else to do  but believe me   it s best left on the shelf in your local virgin store
