honestly  if anyone has a brain  there s not   positive thing  to say about this movie what so ever    i lost my   renting this  i d rather laugh at will smith saying  if you got a dream  you got to protect it    all the actors must ve been bored or had no fame at the time  even matthew mc conahay  however you spell it  was better then all the actors in this movie  when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw   if you see this movie  and have anything good to say  you iq  must be extremely low  with such bad taste in movies  it hurts  thank you and the truth  has been spoken   save yourself from the misery    get devil s rejects  now that s a classic
