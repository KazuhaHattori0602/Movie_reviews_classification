hard to believe that director barbet schroeder once did the majestic and very funny maitresse   and now only seems to do  by the numbers  hollywood thrillers   this is very lightweight john grisham material  crossed with the plot of a tv movie  bullock is cass mayweather  a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers  ben chaplin is her reserved police partner sam kennedy  and together they make an uncomfortable duo  not good  when two unbalanced college maladriots  gosling and pitt  decide to send them on a wild goose chase   by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene   fair enough  but while bullock and chaplin fail to create any sparks  we also have to endure a several dull overly melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in cass s history  then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff side log cabin where there s absolutely no doubt the ott ending will be set  oooh  the atmosphere   watch any episode of csi instead  it s to the point and far more exciting
