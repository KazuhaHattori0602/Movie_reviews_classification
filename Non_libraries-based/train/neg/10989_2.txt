 warning   no plot spoilers ahead  but movie spoilers nonetheless  my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast  wow   very  very wrong  this movie is an overdone  overwrought  and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film   years after it was shot  the copyright date on the box said   yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early  s  and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late  s early  s dresses and hairdos  it looked as if it had been shot a good   or   years before the rest of the film  i tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback  and therefore supposed to look old  but it looked wwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy more  s than  s or even  st century trying to be  s  then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up  and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences  yet it s a different  much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks  i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included   it was all the flashback sequences  shot in   as a complete student film of the same title as this movie  it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up  and indeed acting the co worker in the   scenes  thus  this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old  re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time  the shell story  shot in   is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead  something about a promise made by the dying man in the early  s to his girl that they would meet on the  fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium   an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in   these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful  overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clich d action that permeates the new movie  don t bother  there s a reason why you ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast   it s terrible
