what s with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie  it s like someone put muddy water on the camera lens   the violence and nudity might turn some people off but  that  along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie i suppose   my favorite line is delivered by tarquin the vampire   alas  your breed is dumb  okay  no one should ever say  alas  in a movie line unless they re english and living in the  th century   the acting by the van helsing character and bad girl  rally  isn t bad  i also liked master little played by ron little  wicked martial arts  don t take it too seriously and you ll enjoy it
