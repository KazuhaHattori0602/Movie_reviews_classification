visually disjointed and full of itself  the director apparently chose to seek faux depth to expand a   minute plot into an   minute snore fest    the moments that work in this film are very limited  and the characters don t even feel real  how could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal    substantively and stylistically  it all feels like a quirky dream sequence  jarring irregular camera work  awkward silences and gaps in action  and what s with the little spider image crawling across the screen  whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school  it added no meaning  just cheese  and didn t even stylistically work with the rest of the film  assuming the film even had a style  which is a close call  what a flop
