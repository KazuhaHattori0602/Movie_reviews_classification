as far as i can tell you  in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors  this film is currently available on dvd  i found it only a few weeks ago   it is on the value dvd label and i paid the grand total of   cents plus tax for it  i found it at a   cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks  now don t you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had  i thought so   this film was indeed well worth   cents    cents  i might start to argue with you  but clearly worth   cents  and remember that saying about getting what you pay for  for slasher film mavens only
