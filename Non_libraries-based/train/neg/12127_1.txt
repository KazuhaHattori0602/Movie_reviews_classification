sorry fulci fans  but i could not get through this one  the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come  the acting was puerile  the story has been done and done  and the direction was non existent    massacre honestly looked like a children s film project  but i ve seen some of those  and they actually look better than this did  it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn t afford   anything  not a dop  not a director  no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was  it was a very poor cinematic experience  one of my worst   this was about the worst suck fest i ve seen  next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space  i ve nothing else to say about it   it rates a   from   the fiend
