when i come on imdb boards i m always fed up when i see a  the worst movie ever  post after watching this  movie i think that i am soon going to create my own post   the opening titles great some kind of lame zoom on a gas oven  yeah focus on the fire explosions great action packed movie   the actors i think that ice t is a cool rapper even a nice actor  sometimes  i insist sometimes  but the steven seagal like policeman he plays is beyond the words  the rest of the cast is well i don t know where those actors were hired but jeez i bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them   the plot hijacking original isn t it   the action sequences the first shot of the movie is an explosion i told myself well  cool at least there will be some nice pyrotechnics i was dead wrong the rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the air force   the dialogs are hilarious the music is pure crap the end is happy  i mean i was happy at the end because the movie was over   my cousin who was watching the movie was delighted  i m   she s  well i was on the verge of taking the movie and burn it maybe next time i m gonna watch it who said never
