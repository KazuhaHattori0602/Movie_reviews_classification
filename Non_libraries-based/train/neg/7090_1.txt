i fell asleep on my couch at  pm last night watching larry sanders  i usually directivo it  but not last night  woke up at  am  invesment banker on the west coast  and was fascinated to see this on hbo  i was shocked on how poor this  movie  was  seriously  shocked  so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb  this is really really bad  the writing is boring  but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school   yes it is shot video  mind you  that is shot on video  not digital video  it does look like a soap opera  the clips from skateboard videos have a more  film  feel to them then this horror   i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything  the shots and blocking are stupid  yes  i chose the word  stupid  not unconventional  not daring  not bold  not boring  just stupid  i know people reviewing this review will say  well give me an example  i cant  it was  am  but trust me  i know you will watch it anyway  you will be drawn by the horrible reviews
