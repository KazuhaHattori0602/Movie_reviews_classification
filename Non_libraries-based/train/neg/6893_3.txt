i had high hopes for this movie  the theater monologue is great and nic balthazar is a very interesting man  with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies    i am a fan of a lot of belgian movies  but this movie is bad  it s completely unbelievable that actors who are   are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers  the  linguistic games  were hideous and over the top  nothing about the film seemed real to me  the ending was way too deus ex machina for me   i am very disappointed and think i wasted an hour and a half of my life
