what a piece of stupid tripe   i won t even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show  it s not worth the time  the one comment i will make is   why get such a dumb  inarticulate doofus to be the star   there aren t many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that fox has stated it will not bring back john doe  a decent series  but will bring back brain dead drivel like joe millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public   fox has lost it  imho
