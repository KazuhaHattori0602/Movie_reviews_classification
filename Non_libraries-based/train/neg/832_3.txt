i give this film it s props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted  but i couldn t get past the implausibility of the whole thing   first and foremost  a game built around the notion of  russian roulette  that has to fill on hour  the big problem is that if you are doing a  live  show  you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the  real  bullet  then what do you do  you have   minutes of show to fill and nothing to show  the corollary is that okay  you get to the end and the first five contestants survive  which means number six has the bullet and can t possibly get the payout  he isn t going to shoot himself at that point  so it s kind of anti climatic    second problem  almost as big  human nature  people are going to flinch  panic  soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television  too much randomness  that s why  real  reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited    the only random thing is the  performance artist s  rant about female sacrifices  which were actually rare historically  even that was predictable  since she went through with shooting herself to no effect    we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at   am in the morning  unlikely  with the token asian girl announcing each boost in ratings   a point on race and sex  big surprise the movies two minority  one gay  and two female contestants are the ones who survive  so we are left with the two white males  and of course  the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it  the purpose of such a show would be it s randomness  but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies   the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide  the eva mendes character  mendes produced and starred in this thing  so she has no one to blame but herself  actually grows a conscience when someone dies  what did she think was going to happen  she is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing  motives never explained  and the show went on to be a big hit  really    the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous  like network  this is neither
