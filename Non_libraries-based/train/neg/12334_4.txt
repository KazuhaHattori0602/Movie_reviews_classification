the premise is ridiculous  the characters unbelievable  the dialogue trite  and the ending absurd    believe me  i m a fan of kevin kline  but watching him do a pepe le pew accent for   hours as a supposed frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds   for her part  meg ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a  take your pick  kewpie doll  baby  puppy  kitten  whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth  she also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being   this movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies lawrence kasdan and kline to vacation in paris and the south of france while being well paid for it  so i can t really blame them
