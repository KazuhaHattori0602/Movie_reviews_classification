the film is based on a genuine  s novel   journalist colin mcinnes wrote a set of three  london novels   absolute beginners   city of spades  and  mr love and justice  i have read all three  the first two are excellent  the last  perhaps an experiment that did not come off  but mcinnes s work is highly acclaimed  and rightly so  this musical is the novelist s ultimate nightmare   to see the fruits of one s mind being turned into a glitzy  badly acted  soporific one dimensional apology of a film that says it captures the spirit of  s london  and does nothing of the sort   thank goodness colin mcinnes wasn t alive to witness it
