i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is  i want my   back  words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap  the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor s mouths  the movie looks like it was filmed with a  s vintage camcorder  i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera  the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot  the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped  then tried to put on a play in your garage  don t get me wrong i wasn t expecting o neil and i love zombie movies  but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable  avoid
