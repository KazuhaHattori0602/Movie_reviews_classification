in its way  mister foe  originally  and more appropriately  titled hallam foe   i can t see addressing its title character as  mister  is a tribute to good acting  both jamie bell  as hallam  a physically attractive voyeur creep  and sophia myles  as kate  his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance  are convincing  the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life  a young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp  and a woman in kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened   she would probably call the police   these things are not  however  what happens in the movie  poor hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair  hallam  of course  hates his stepmother and lets he know it  she has sex with him  kate s some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games  she looks like his birth mother  it all ends happily with hallam  resolving  his  issues   forty some years ago  the play and brilliantly acted movie  who s afraid of virginia woolf  had a similarly optimistic ending  with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart  the trouble is  it doesn t always work that way  especially when nobody really cares  in virginia woolf  the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation  in mister foe  the emotional revelation never really happens
