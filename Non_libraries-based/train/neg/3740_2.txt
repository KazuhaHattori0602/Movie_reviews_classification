right away  this film was ridiculous  not that it didn t have redeeming aspects
 for example  the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery  anyone not living on the east coast should know the south doesn t have beautiful mountains like those found in the west  i knew it was utah right off the bat  but perhaps dalton couldn t suppress his english accent  so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town  subverting his accent into a southern one was easier  sure the film has plot twists  but its phony sense of place was something i couldn t get past  it s not like utah doesn t have meth labs  so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the south is beyond me    one other thing in action pictures always puzzles me  why do they always make the  cocking  sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun  it seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a  chuk chich  signifying a  mm was loaded and ready to fire  of course  the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary    lastly  the pyrotechnics were way over the top  but hey  this film was targeted to a certain  market segment  i suppose  it s too bad  each of the actors can act  but this film was lame
