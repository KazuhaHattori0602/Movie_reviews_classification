i really wanted to like this movie  i absolutely love kenny hotz  and spenny rice has a charming side to him  not that i like spenny at all  spenny ruins this movie  he should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie   anyways  it s pretty boring aside from a scene with roger ebert in it  there really isn t too many celebrities in this movie  and most don t seem to say more than one line  overall this movie was disappointing  i would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season   dvd of kenny vs spenny  it comes for free on the  rd disc  regardless of this production  i am still very excited to check out the papel chase
