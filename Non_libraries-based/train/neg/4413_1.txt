broad enough for you  wait till you see this heavy handed  adaption of a little collegiate one act  what is shocking and wild in  college rarely holds up over time  and this is proof  to take on the  catholic church with broadside humor just isn t shocking or  interesting or funny  it s kind of boring  the performers are all  game  giving all they ve got  but it s basically a play that doesn t  open up to film well  not a lot of fun
