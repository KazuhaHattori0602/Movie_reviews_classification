a really bad sequel  part   had a lot of funny moments   part   is just bad  in a boring way  and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans   shame on you  otto waalkes   the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pis ed about the other characters  it s quite easy to identify with him   the screenplay is sloppy non existent  the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately  the acting is worse than a  nd grade school play    technically the movie is awful as well  but who can blame the cinematographer sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director
