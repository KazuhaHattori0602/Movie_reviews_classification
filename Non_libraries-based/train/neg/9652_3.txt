the film was written   years back and a different director was planning it with srk and aamir in lead roles  the film finally was made now with vipul shah directing it and ajay and salman starring together after a decade hum dil de chuke sanam   the movie however falls short due to it s  s handling and worst it s loopholes  the film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangle  everything is predictable and filmy and too clich d  there are loopholes like how ajay runs away from london airport and makes a place for himself with no one  even the way he starts his band is not convincing the second half gets better with the twist in the tale of ajay destroying salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad note  direction by vipul shah is ordinary to below average music is the worst point  most songs are mediocre  amongst actors ajay gives his best shot though he isn t convincing as a rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon asin is nothing great just a show piece ranvijay should stick to mtv om puri is okay
