i can t believe this is on dvd  even less it was available at my local video store   some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a   budget  i find this funny  i would find it very bad whichever the budget   still more funny  i read the following in another review   dramatics aside  if you love horror and you love something along the lines of duel   updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in  you ll love this movie   what  this is a shame comparing those two movies   i give a   since i can t give a   i just don t see any way this movie could be entertaining
