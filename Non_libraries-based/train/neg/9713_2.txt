the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television  at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in   or   other american crime shows aired roughly the same time   i saw it and i was bored to death  the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind  the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back   or even   years seems so unlikely   the time is also a factor as they only have   min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members  if they are still alive  this combined with the  personal  problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster   i give it a  star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it which you then of course won t do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap
