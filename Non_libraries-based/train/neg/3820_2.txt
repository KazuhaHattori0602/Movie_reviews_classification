watching  speak easily  is painful for fans of buster keaton  seeing such a phenomenal writer  actor  comic  director  and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a picasso used as a drop cloth  or perhaps more like seeing the finest camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into cheez whiz    keaton is ill cast as professor post  whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying   tell me about the rabbits  george   post would have said something like   kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family leporidae of the order lagomorpha  kind sir  who i believe is primarily addressed with the epithet  george  when keaton created his own characters  they might be situationally clueless but they weren t stupid  they were quick studies and became masters of their worlds  not so with post  who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the titanic  and while keaton s original characters had a charming naivet  and innocence  post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused  he d put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help    there are a couple of small  redeeming moments  such as keaton s attempts to get rid of the vampish thema todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a greek dance  but it s just not worth enduring the entire film to see them   if you re a fan of bad movies  get drunk and watch  speak easily  with friends  a la  mystery science theater   but other than that  stick with the silents  let them be   of what buster keaton is remembered for
