ah  lucio fulci  rest in peace  this infamous italian is most  famous for  zombie  and the absolutely unwatchable  the  psychic  and  manhattan baby  well  add this to the unwatchable  list   the plot  as it were  concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold  mask and a g string  she wants the power of a young dubbed  stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow  they are magic  because they glow  arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig   and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat  action sequences  in the end  the nekkid chick is defeated  but not  before taking the mask off and reminding me why i broke up with  my high school girlfriend   fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with  smoke  nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you  crave sunny delight and a cigarette  the special effects are  laughable  in one sequence  our ambiguously gay duo are  attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on  the film itself  the majority of the effects budget must have been  spent on the fulci licious gore  which consists entirely of spurting  wounds  hey  we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while  but when you get into spurting wound overkill  it gets boring   i kept having to play with the brightness setting on my tv anyway  just to see what the heck was happening   there is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies  so let me  do a little look into the future if you find this movie and watch it   you will regret it  the scene on the video box  by media  does not  appear in the film in any context whatsoever   conquest  is a con  job  what mst k could have done with this   this is rated  r  for strong physical violence  strong gore  female  nudity  brief male nudity  and mild sexual content
