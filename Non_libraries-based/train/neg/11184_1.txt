this is a truly terrible film   i m only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it  if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy   unutterably dull  although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen  then the credits rolled  and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel   i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb  over   stars when i last saw the voting  are you people voting ironically   please  please  please do not watch this film
