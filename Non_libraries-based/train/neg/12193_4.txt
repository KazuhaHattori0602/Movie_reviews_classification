 look  i know this may suck right now  but pain is temporary  film is forever  whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come    robert de niro  this was initially a film for steven spielberg  the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes  and so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison robert de niro  like  jurassic park   poltergeist  and  war of the worlds  the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast  the beast being the creation of the father  a lawyer who failed to defend de niro during his trial    in typical spielberg fashion  the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins  like oscar schindler  robin williams  sam niel  tom cruise and virtually every  daddy  figure in spielberg land  the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that spielberg so enjoys   but spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to martin scorsese  who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare  the result is arguably the worst film in scorsese s filmography  and  ironically  his most illuminating   an artist s failures or misfires are often very revealing  exposing the inner workings of their art  when the story doesn t work  the characters don t connect or the images don t sear  we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core  this   the remaining carcass  is what the director s cinema is about   now  cape fear  is an impersonal film  so we won t find any thematic connections to the rest of scorsese s filmography  you already sacrificed me  de niro yells  but the films themes of catholic redemption are cookie cutter  what the film does  though  is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on  watch how scorsese s camera desperately whips back and forth  how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention  but more importantly  watch how the film makes no spatial sense  a showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage  a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family s house doesn t seem to exist anywhere in particular  there is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture  scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment    the reason for this is that scorsese s camera always has to be bound  or intimately tethered  to his central character  for the world around the character to make sense  his camera has to be focused on the character  resnais can take you around a french hotel  welles and hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building  cameron can give you a tour of the titanic  scott can recreate an entire future cityscape  lucas can give you an alien desert planet  and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook  close up mid shot wide shot  combinations  but scorsese can t do this  there s no poetry  no sense of tangible space in his films  he s all about the character  you break that tether  you leave that boxing ring  that taxi cab  you look away from de niro  and everything collapses  he simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting  which  in a way  is a prerequisite for action film making   scorsese tried to rectify this problem with  gangs of new york  where the space and the sets become the central character  but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of daniel day lewis  the actor drawing scorsese s camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb       even as a generic b movie  this is an ugly  vulgar looking film  look at the matte paintings  the inept attempts at tension  the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown  still  we have robert de niro to pick up the slack  de niro  who gives his body over to scorsese like a tattooed christ  gives the film its only great scene  in an improvised romantic sequence with young a juliette lewis  he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her  a kind of symbolic rape  the girl runs away  both aroused and repelled by this man s interest   but de niro s performance  so deliciously over the top  simply can t be imitated by scorsese  you d need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like de palma to make this work  but scorsese  nope   worth one viewing
