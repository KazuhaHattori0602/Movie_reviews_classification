i read some gushing reviews here on imdb and thought i would give this movie a look  disappointed  on the plus side the male leads are good  and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince  seems to be full of its  own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess   it is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows    a film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism  fatalism  menace and cynical characters   well that is the story here    losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness  alcoholism  laziness  indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other   would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers  i thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress   whilst some good moments  i finished up feeling i had wasted my time
