i purchased this movie at a car boot sale  so i was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as a nightmare on elm street   or the hills have eyes   but i thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch  however  it proved to be not at all enjoyable  but instead the acting and the general movie was mock able  such as the ways the the  unsees killer  murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women  it was a stereotypical horror film  i say this because of the following reasons     three blonde women in danger  the majority get killed    one survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer    surprise surprise  help arrives in the form of a shotgun   by using three simple points  i have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie  so you are now lucky enough to not have to watch it
