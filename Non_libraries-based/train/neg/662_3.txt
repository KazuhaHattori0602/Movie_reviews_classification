and rent a good horror movie  it s like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and didn t realize every single thing he wrote was clich d and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like  scream  and  scary movie   in between the scary bits is the most banal and boring dialog ever written  stupid  we re going to the prom  junk  i wanted to claw my ears off  honestly   the hills  has better dialog   there really was no need to make this movie  leading lady is uninteresting and i kept thinking  her  really  guy is obsessed with her  really    all the characters act in stupid ways  including the police   cover the place in teams of   front and back  not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed    the serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem  no resistance from victims  or doors  nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back  or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door  the people are like mentally disabled sheep   by the by  if you re a gore fan  you ll be disappointed too  all the killing is kept offscreen and is   ahem   tastefully done   so boo hoo for you    none of the killings is the least bit interesting  most of the time they ve already happened by the time we find out   the only clich  missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies   oh kitty  you scared me  i thought you were the killer   aiieeee    and then at the end when it s time for the killer to die   well  let s just say it s the easiest and most obvious choice  snore   the audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout  it was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough  don t encourage this kind of lazy film making    oh  and by the way   no crowning of a prom king or queen  no tiara  no bucket of blood    so save your money and rent  carrie  or  friday the  th  or  halloween  or  scream  or  scary movie   any of them  to get a good scare with some original twists
