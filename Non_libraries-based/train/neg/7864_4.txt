the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more  of course it s not going to be an oscar nominated film  it s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for   minutes   the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert  it s just them fighting back throughout the whole film  which includes a lot of violence  which is basically the whole film  as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing  and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience   i d give the hills have eyes ii   out of   for pure entertainment  and that only  although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on  as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake  the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment  something to pass time if you re bored  and nothing else
