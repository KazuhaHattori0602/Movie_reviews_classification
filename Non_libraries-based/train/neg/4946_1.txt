admittedly  i watched this piece with already very low expectations  dieter bohlen is a rather untalented composer parvenu whose lack of talent is only surpassed by the size of his ego   this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was   per cent humor free  it is rude  offensive  redneck and blatantly anti  women  as such  it is a creation befitting bohlen  but the average viewer will be rather put off by it  no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater  it would ve bombed big time   not even the expense of   megaeuros were able to save this utter piece of crap  save your time  and money
