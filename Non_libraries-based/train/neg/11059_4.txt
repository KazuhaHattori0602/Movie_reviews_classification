 dahmer  is an interesting film although i wouldn t use  horror  or  thriller  do describe it  it s more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer   jeremy renner portrays serial killer jeffrey dahmer  who drugged  murdered and dismembered his male victims  the film centers on the relationship between dahmer and  rodney  well played by artel kay ru    rodney is almost the more interesting character  enamored of dahmer and having once escaped an attack  he returns to dahmer for sex and survives a second attack   i think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray dahmer s formative years  how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into dahmer s belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims   the roles are well played but the story is thin
