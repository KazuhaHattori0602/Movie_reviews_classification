i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of movies
until now  this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say  i am not a muslim  nor am i an islamic studies expert  but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses    the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary  most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation  this is certainly the case with islam  what the west needs to know  yes  there are fundamentalists around the world  and some of them are muslim  but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading  this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more   for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary  here are several points that may help    there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary   the documentary focuses on the middle east  but more muslims live outside of that region  more muslims live in china  believe it or not  than in saudi arabia  about   of all muslims live in pakistan  bangladesh  india and indonesia   the translation of the qur an used in the documentary is a questionable one  i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking  i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why  surrah   is a good example  the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell  but the translation i have reads instead   those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire  the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways    the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam  but this is not true  although it is true that much comes from the qur an and hadith  islam also recognizes a concept called  urf or  normative behavior  obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways  but  urf is meant to be  good  behavior  what an average person would consider right or wrong   the documentary presents shar ia  islamic law  as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow  this is simply not true  there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law    the hadith tradition is similar  there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others  using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate  real and applicable  is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say
 which is what the documentary did   what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem  not islam or any other religion  christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on  i know this is not the same as suicide bombing  just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem  if you feel you have the answer  then everyone else must be wrong  but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people s views about politics  religion  god  or whatever
