my  year old daughter  alexandra  writes   i thought it was very boring  and i thought it was just a repeat of stuff from   dalmatians  i couldn t wait for the movie to end  the best part was the credits at the beginning   they were cute and well done  the rest of the film is not worth watching  thank you
