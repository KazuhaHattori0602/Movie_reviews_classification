this piece of crap might have been acclaimed   years ago  but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the native american indians played by white men  the right wing republican james stewart was a huge racist in real life  just like his close friend john wayne  in   stewart had actor hal williams fired from  the jimmy stewart show   a short lived series that mercifully flopped  just because williams was black  as if that were not bad enough  this film is very dated and boring  watch  dances with wolves  instead for a less racist view   stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made  and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after  year old debra paget  i m surprised it was even allowed
