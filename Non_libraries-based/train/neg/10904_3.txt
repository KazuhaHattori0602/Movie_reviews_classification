i hired this movie expecting a few laughs  hopefully enough to keep me amused but i was sorely mistaken  this movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it  aimed at an age group of   this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied  worth no more than   votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste   hours of their lives
