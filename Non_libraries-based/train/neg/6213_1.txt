this movie made it into one of my top   most awful movies  horrible    there wasn t a continuous minute where there wasn t a fight with one monster or another  there was no chance for any character development  they were too busy running from one sword fight to another  i had no emotional attachment  except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them    scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies  lotr  star wars and matrix    examples   the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda  obee one and vader     the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings   elijah wood is the victim in both films  and wait it hypnotizes  stings  its victim and wraps them up uh hello    and the whole machine vs  humans theme was the matrix or terminator   there are more examples but why waste the time  and will someone tell me what was with the nazi s  nazi s    there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion  the movie could not decide if it was a children s movie or an adult movie and wasn t much of either    just awful  a real disappointment to say the least  save your money
