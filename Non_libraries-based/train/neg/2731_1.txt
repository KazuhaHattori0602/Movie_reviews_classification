truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen ever   they tried to make up for it by giving it the   we know we are doing this  routine  that would have been funny if it weren t for the fact that  the simpsons  had already done it  and it still wouldn t make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place   the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character s  mainly j d s  fantasies  the flashbacks weren t even of actual events that occurred  just compilations of say  j d falling over or  i don t know  elliott falling over  if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i d go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life   scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit coms have to  and it disappoints me  they managed to go   and a quarter seasons without an episode like this    i was hoping that scrubs wouldn t have to be that kind of sit com   and just as a passing thought  why the hell was dr cox bald
