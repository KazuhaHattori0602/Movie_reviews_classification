hearing about how hilarious this movie is  i finally rent it at  the video store and for   minutes maybe i laughed   times  this  movie  a collection of skits that make fun of television is an  incoherrent mess  the jokes fall flat  the humor deals with  issues from the  s that just aren t relevant anymore  and  the jokes go on way too long  almost like the new snl skits the  past few years  yeah  chevy chase is in this but maybe of all  about   or   minutes  i liked the fact that this was very  raunchy and had nudity galore but couldn t it be funny  do  yourself a favor and rent kentucky fried movie which is a far  superior film made in the
