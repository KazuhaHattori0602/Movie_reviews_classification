lucky me  i got a sneak peak at this pathetic little shot in texas  horror  flick from artisan entertainment a week before it hit video shelves and let me tell you i ve rarely laughed so hard in my life as i did watching this atrocious megabomb fly off the rails and steal the title of  worst killer clown movie ever made  from the insufferably stupid full moon fiasco killjoy  i m sure many of us horror fans have suffered through that one  from all indications  it was shot on dv  and it doesn t really  look  all that bad quality wise for digital  but boy does it ever fail miserably in every other area where it counts   the story  slight and cliche as it is  goes as follows  an executive  ken hebert  who also scripted and co produced with the director  takes skeptical co worker tracy  amanda watson  and horny married couple mark and susan  hank fields and chris buck  along on a weekend getaway to a  yawn  secluded cabin `  miles  from the nearest town  on the way there  they pick up a bitchy slutty hitchhiker  melissa bale  in a bar and end up at their destination where a nightly campfire tale about a murderous clown stalking the very same wooded area comes true when each of the profanity yackin  pot smokin  friends  disappears one by one  with only mutilated doll parts left behind to tell the tale of their fates   the killer clown doesn t even show up in the film until near the end and it looks nothing like the demonic depiction of it on the video box  aside from being morbidly obese  it basically spends an hour prancing around in the woods  chopping up wood and blabbing nursery rhymes  i cannot say enough bad things about the cast  especially the two guys and the hitchhiker chick  who either deliver their insipid dialogue with a bare minimum of enthusiasm or overact at the most inappropriate times  doesn t really help that the script is completely and utterly devoid of suspense  originality  intelligence  general coherence or humor  i could go on for days on how inept this film is  how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is  but i ll just nod off by pointing out the whole package is quite a riot in that boy this sucks kind of way   also noting that the film has been released here in the us as s i c k   serial insane clown killer  it s currently catalogued under its  original title  of grim weekend   score    out of
