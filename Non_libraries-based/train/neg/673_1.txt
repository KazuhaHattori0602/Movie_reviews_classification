 let me count the ways     a title only  remake  that pulls out every clich  in the slasher handbook     a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic     a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills     a pg  rating that insures no gore  violence  or sex     a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious     a cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn t possibly care about them     a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere  much unlike the original prom night     a script of dialog that s beyond poor   it s mind numbing      a series of cardboard performances  not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that     a completely inept teen targeted slasher remake that s not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination   or even to show a puddle of blood   it s a no brainer horror fans  save your money   bomb out of
