worst dcom i have seen  ever  well  maybe not as bad as smart house  this was just bad  the acting and story was fine  but the effects sucked   they were so fake  the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen  that was probably the only scene in which i was excited   overall  i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly    i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene
