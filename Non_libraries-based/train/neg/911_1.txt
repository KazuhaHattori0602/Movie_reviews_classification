this must be one of the worst swedish movies ever made    it is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year    i ve never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie  it shouldn t be that obvious    i can t understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this  if i had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before i saw the movie  it is gone for sure now    i ve heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and i can t understand how that is even possible
