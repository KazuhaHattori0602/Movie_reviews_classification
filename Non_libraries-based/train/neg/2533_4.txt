   the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement   i have seen zatoichi   i believe   has not been released on zone    usa  zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing  the story line was complicated  and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines  at one point  i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film   this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects  a head rolling  limbs severed  blood  and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character  all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action  and won a great following without having to resort to effects   i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend  this is the first zatoichi film from his studio  i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films   and recommend them
