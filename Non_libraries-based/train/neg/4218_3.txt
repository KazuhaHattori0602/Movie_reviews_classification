this isn t one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology  or being dated  issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with  but rather a review on the story telling  which most of us are truly interested in   the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members  and two civilians  the hero and heroine  who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs   the manipulations aren t so bad by film standards  and we know from the plot that realism isn t going to be high  what films like this need are credible and likable characters  along with some semblance of reason in the actions   this film lacks both  for a full length film  only   characters are given any time  and   of them are barely looked into  mcclure s hero is beyond  routine  and doesn t make much sense in any era   the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered  but the riddle is not much of a riddle  and we could care less   a lot of failure in a film that should have been better  even for its time
