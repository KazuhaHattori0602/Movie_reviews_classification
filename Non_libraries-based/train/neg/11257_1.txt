this movie feels so empty  in every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like   because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird   the acting was horrible  it s so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives  looking at the floor for their marks   spoilers  also you ll find yourself banging your head watching the movie  at one point at sky captain s home base they have like   planes sitting on the airstrip  they have advanced warning an attack is coming  so what do they do  nothing  all of the planes get blown up and yet again the only person fighting back is the sky captain   the entire world is under attack and he s the only person ever fighting back  at the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally  but what do they do  nothing  the movie is over
