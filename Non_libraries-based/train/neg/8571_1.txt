penn takes the time to develop his characters  and we almost care about them  however there are some real problems with the story here  we see no real motivation for the evil brother s behavior  and the time line is screwed up  supposedly set in   the music is late  s early  s  the references and dialogue is  s s  the potential for a powerful climax presents itself  and penn allows it to slip away  but even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch  but not great
