at first glance this documentary fiction cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking  of course  when something provokes thought  it can then be scrutinized  the reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions  the link that  what the bleep  would have you see between science and spirituality is  in fact  not rooted in science at all  the transcendental meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area  washington d c  in this case  in reality the hra  homicides  rapes  and assaults  crime rate was about   higher in   than the average crime rate between   there was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study  in fact  each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked   my conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke  either way  i suggest that you do not waste your time   if you are looking for a long winded movie about science that could provoke thoughts  you might consider mindwalk
