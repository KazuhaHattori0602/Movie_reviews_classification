great cgi effects   a truly oscar worthy performance by gary sinise as lt  dan    tom hanks is a one trick pony in this movie  how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime    this movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation  with a barely concealed right wing prejudice  beginning from forrest s service in vietnam all the way through to the  resolution  with jenny at the end   with that said  though  it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through  i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive  zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of gump himself      maybe that was the point he was trying to make   watch this film and ask yourself  what is robert zemeckis saying about what makes a good american    forrest seems to have made the  right  choices and been at the  right place at the right time  for the last   years  those who are wrong according to the director s vision seem to pay a heavy price  so is zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic  even american quality
