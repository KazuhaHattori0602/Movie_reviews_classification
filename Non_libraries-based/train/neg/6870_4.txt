a well intentioned movie about sonja horowitz  ren e zellweger  the wife of devout talmudic scholar mendel  glenn fitzgerald  who is deeply unhappy  mendel s brother sender  christopher eccleston  sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she s already an expert jewelry  he also starts an affair with her  and then when she spends time with a puerto rican artist  he dumps her and betrays her to the family  which shuts her out  there s a subplot in which sonja s dead brother talks to her  and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman  but why is not clear  much is not clear  unfortunately  including what is going on with sonja  why she tells the rebbe there s a fire inside her and maybe it s not from god  and what this means  and what the magical beggar woman tells her means  to an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra orthodox community  and yet sonja is not exactly liberated  nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well thought out  the title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good woman and yet it s the bastard sender who quotes it to sonja  zellweger struggles with the part  she s supposed to be a jew from the mid west and sometimes her accent is flat  and at other times it s taken on the characteristic sounds of brooklyn  she s at her best when she s being tough and taking charge  but ultimately the movie s a mess
