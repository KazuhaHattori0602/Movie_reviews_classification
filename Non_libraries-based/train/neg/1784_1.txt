ok  i taped this off tv and missed the very start  the film was about   or so seconds into the titles  i assume  so if anything happened before that i missed it   lots of people say mark hammill is in this  i didn t see him  i did recognise clive barker  john landis and obviously stephen king doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant   alice krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make up   even with the opening titles it s never really explained very well exactly what sleepwalkers are or where they come from  from the title sequence i assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life force from humans  i assume they live a long time and these particular   are possibly the last of their kind   add to this a very large dose of incest  yes  i thought it was a bit suspect too  shapeshifting  killer cats and invisibility and you have sleepwalkers   it s a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main   characters and far too many cameo s to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer   avoid
