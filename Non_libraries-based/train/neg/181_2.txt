ah  channel   of local mexican t v  everyday  at   a m  they air horror movies from the  s to early  s  it was  return to cabin by the lake  the movie that aired yesterday  i regret for watching it   the original  cabin by the lake  was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was good accepted  the problem is that this sequel is horrible  not even unintentionally funny and tries to imitate the original  ugh  the plot is really stupid in all the sense of the word   the movie at some points looks like a soap opera because of it s absurd dialogs  cinematography  and direction   my advice is   avoid this one at all costs  it s a movie that it shouldn t be watched by anyone  not even for lovers of mediocre film making   you have been warned
