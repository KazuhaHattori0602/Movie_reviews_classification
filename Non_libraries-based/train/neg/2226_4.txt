dd films were damn corny  damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least  this film isn t just a comedy but a mix of melodrama  romance everything  every drama scene is blown out of proportion  the comedy is funny but corny too yet the film keeps you entertained  those days govinda films were loud  crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed  david dhawan does a okay job music is okay  govinda acts well in comedy and drama karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts kader is as usual gulshan  prem chopra are typecast shakti is hilarious
