this is not a good movie  too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par  the  d was ok  but not superb  i almost fell asleep in this movie   the story is about   young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it  the characters are lacking  i truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested  pixar this is not   i would have liked to see more special  d effects  also i wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying  lord of the flies  pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting
