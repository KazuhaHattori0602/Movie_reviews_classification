this is a terrible  terrible film   first of all tooo long  the longest movie i have ever seen   the stories are all too damn over the top   as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the story line is ruined   the comedy wasn t comedy  it wasn t funny at all   the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die   i had some expectations from this movie  but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes   the only thing good about this movie is the music  and obviously vidya balan  she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors  she s just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic  govinda and the blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this disastrous movie  govinda perfectly fits in the role of the taxi driver  and the blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance   another talented actress ayesha takiya is completely wasted in this movie  so is priyanka  akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top  anil and juhi are also totally wasted   the only one not wasted is salman because he has no talent what so ever to be wasted   all in all this is a very impossible movie with mishmashed screenplay and tooo masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes  imagine how stupid this movie is     it is four hours long  think and rethink before going to the cinemas  better avoid it
