granted  i m not the connoisseur d horror my partner is  but a well put together  clever flick is worth the time  my quibbles  in brief     dialog often weak and at times unbelievable coming from the given character     unconvincing acting     storyline never really caught fire   the writers plucked choice bits from half a dozen mainstream films  tossed into a kettle  simmered not nearly enough and tried feeding us poor saps the resulting mess  al dente   long and short  while not absolutely terrible  it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my netflix rentals
