what a complete piece of trash  plot notwithstanding  when a movie s action revolves around airplanes  you d think the writers producers director  or anyone  would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details  the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie  here are just a few  i m glad i missed the sr  sequence   certain to have been worse than the  air force one  f  spectacle  commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing     likely the  cheap  use of some boeing advertising publicity footage by the director  exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring  much less multi million dollar aircraft avionics wiring  airplanes like the   rely on pressure alone rather than ship s supply oxygen to maintain breathable air  and if they did rely on an on board supply  the canister would be far bigger than fist sized  medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection  those were f s  not f s  mach    speed of sound  would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff  watch the airspeed indicator   standard formation  is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile   route  formation is what they were flying   not the most useful formation for an intercept   acquiring missile lock  is not likely to get an airline pilot s attention   they have no radar detection or countermeasures   wait for my signal  is not inter flight communication for preparing to fire anything  depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank  yelling into a headset does not make it transmit  magnetic headings are given as  headings  not  bearings  and headings are between   and   degrees  compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground  so turning left  not  port    that s a boat thing  from a  bearing  of   to   is just stupid  it is in most cases impossible to just  turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached    that sort of thing will result in   degree rolls until the yoke is centered again  the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely  airplanes don t stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back  and  s have more than one little lever to control the multi engine thrust  flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension  not seconds before landing  good way to crash  wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane  simply pulling the throttle s   this time a different lever in the movie  to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed  did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f s and not f s  guess i did
 and that s just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie
