i m not a huge star trek fan  but i was looking forward to this  i was intrigued by the pre hype descriptions of the enterprise  its cramped submarine styling and rough edged technology compared to the treks we are used to   i didn t see anything all that interesting in this pilot  i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing   i will admit that i did like some of the character development   the depictions of the humans as an  adolescent  species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining   and that vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack   but i don t think i m going to get hooked on this series
