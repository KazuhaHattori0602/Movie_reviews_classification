this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in tsai ming liang for me  it oozes laziness from its every frame  so i m not going to analyse it thoroughly either  but some observations     if the premise is drought  why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees  i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film  in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy  and watermelon the trivial substitute  sex  or it is only a matter of lousy film making  not giving a damn about being coherent     we don t get to know what had happened to the porn actress  why she is unconscious or  presumably  dead  it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully  bombastically  delivered  but in retrospect  her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick  a pretext   just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in     nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn t expressed better   years ago   and without needlessly humiliating his actors     the musical numbers  recycled from  the hole  felt like a secondary schooler s idea of artistic counterpointing  executed on that very secondary school level of skill  if that was the point  the point sucked
