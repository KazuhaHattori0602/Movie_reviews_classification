in    the visitors  was an enormous hit in france  so  the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately  this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made    this is a movie that doesn t keep its promises  indeed  it s supposed to tell a sole story  jean reno must go in the twentieth century and take christian clavier back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course  the problem is that clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century  and so make him get back in the middles ages is rather hard  instead of this  the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot  as a consequence  the movie becomes sometimes muddle headed  sometimes a bit of a mess   but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors  reno and clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie  they re going over the top and become annoying  then  why did jean marie poir  the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role  he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful  the other actors aren t better  marie anne chazel is nonexistent and christian bujeau  unbearable    of course  the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness  certain sequences and dialogs are affected  it also appears hollow because poir  takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie  thus  a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding   a labored and disappointing follow up  anyway  what s the interest of this movie otherwise commercial
