primal species comes from b movie legend roger corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a low budget b movie and it knows it   a bunch of terrorists high jack a lorry and kill an entire army doing so  they believe it to hold uranium  but no  it contains two dino s with a taste for human flesh  then a crack team  who might as well be called delta force get called in   ok  this ain t jurassic park  and yes the dino s are never clearly seen because it s obviously a guy in a costume that s not too dissimilar to barney the dinosaur   only slightly less terrifying but come on guys this had about   of jurassic park s budget and as such does what it can   does this deserve to be in the bottom  hell no  i think the nearly half of voters who give this a     are being way way overly harsh  it s much closer to a   it s actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the bottom   and has a similar production value to a sci fi channel production   again movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on imdb   the acting is as expected in a b movie although none of the actors take it that seriously  neither does the script  all in all it s an enjoyable b movie   not for film snobs    out of
