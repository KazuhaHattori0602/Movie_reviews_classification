naturally i didn t watch  gi jane  out of choice  i was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house   gi jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario  which of course it isn t  the result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints  restricting the amount of humour  of which there is none  or entertaining action scenes  and soon becomes too serious  the film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable    gi jane  fails where other action films succeed  mainly because films such as james bond  dirty harry and various others are larger than life  yet never proclaim to be otherwise  they are escapism  and therefore entertaining   gi jane  tries to be real and fails   this is a very disappointing film from ridley scott  with a very non credible storyline  unremarkable acting  and the only reason i give it   instead of   is for some of the technical work
