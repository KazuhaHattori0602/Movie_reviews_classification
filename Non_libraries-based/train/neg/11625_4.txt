except for the brady variety hour  this was some of the hokiest television i ve seen in a while  the video production qualities weren t too bad  but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early  s  and marie osmond looks like she did battle with the avon lady  and lost big time  way too much eyeliner   it was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans danny kaye and eric severeid take part in this  even more interesting was watching alex haley talk about the african pavillion in world showcase that would be opening  in about a year   as of this writing it is   years later and it hasn t opened yet  unless you count disney s animal kingdom  all in all though  for all the shortcomings  this still an interesting visual piece of disney history
