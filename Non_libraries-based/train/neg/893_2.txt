when i bought this dvd i though   it seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in portuguese standards
 let s give it a chance
  i was totally wrong  what a disappointing movie  first  it s not a comedy  it s a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it s even worse than many portuguese soap operas  second  the plot is so boring  and leads nowhere
 it has no structure  it just flows  like the wind  in one or another direction
 the production is also bad  the sound mixing is horrible  because sometimes the voices are disconnected  it made me remind some old portuguese movies from the  s
 the acting should have been better too
 well  to sum up  it s not with films like this one that portuguese cinema will improve  in fact  it was one of the worst portuguese movies i have seen in the last years  bad argument  bad acting  bad production
 i had no high hopes for this movie  but it was much worse than i ve ever imagined  just forget about it
