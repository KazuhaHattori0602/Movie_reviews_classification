while the original first blood had its far fetched moments  it was at least exciting in parts  in rambo  first blood  part ii the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic book action  plausibility is totally rejected  logic nose dives  stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission  just like any other wish fulfilment actioner of that time  e g  invasion usa  commando  red scorpion  rambo  first blood  part ii cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for  if you can tell from the word go that rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers  what is left to get excited about   imprisoned after the events of the first movie  john j rambo  sylvester stallone  is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the far east  the year is   and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any american pows still trapped in the jungles of vietnam  rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor colonel trautman  richard crenna  but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by marshall murdock  charles napier  rambo s job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any american pows   if it doesn t  he is to rendezvous with a chopper  if it does  he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date  aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge  the beautiful and resourceful co bao  julia nickson  sure enough  rambo discovers that there are pows in the camp  but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them
 when he reaches the rendezvous point  the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of murdock who  it seems  doesn t really want to find any pows because of the political and military implications  rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured  but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the pows and get his revenge on the treacherous murdock   the few good points of the film come from jack cardiff s polished photography  jerry goldsmith s exhilarating score  and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics  beyond these scant pickings  the film is a failure  the actors are reduced to macho posturing  the plot rings false  the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless  the dialogue is absurd
 even the violence becomes numbingly predictable  at the time of its release america was under the presidency of ronald reagan  a man with simplistic and near hysterical anti communist sentiments  for this reason  contemporary audiences lapped up this commie bashing shooting fest as if it was the greatest movie of all time  transforming it into an undeserved box office success  thankfully times have changed   nowadays we can look upon it as a simple minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count  ludicrously dumb politics  and a ludicrous hero
