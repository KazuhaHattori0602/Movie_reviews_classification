while filming an  s horror movie called  hot blooded  the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer  after all of this  the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust  so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though they re warned by people to keep away from the film  as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film  from this it s labelled as a cursed production  not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role  but not as the daughter but the mother  but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the film s killer   look what  scream  started  hey  i enjoy those films  but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses  during this stage the sub genre came back with vengeance  but it wasn t much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts  where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise   cut  which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick  but you know what  i found it a cheesy delight  yeah  it s gawd awful and highly forgettable  but it s a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted  although i did hate it when i originally came across it  but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it  it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again  but this time it wasn t so sweet   the film came out around the same time as  scream   and  urban legends  the final cut  did  which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie   scream   is obviously the strongest of the three  but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends  the final cut  though  it did seem more of a throwback to the  s slashers than that of one of scream s bastard offspring  pretty much the film is given b grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances  the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense  while  the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it  she plays the wash up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send up performance  she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly  the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars  that s if you re an australian  with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts  also pop singer  and supposed actress  kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up  nice  these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed  sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue  because they have no real substance to be there   the plot starts off rather interestingly  then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up  but then it makes a sudden u turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre  simply it s rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking
 oh my  this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner  but sadly it falls along way  but don t you just love an opening ending  also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential  tongue in cheek approach  predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over stated at times  but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit  the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness  but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added  some  spookiness  the cinema scene is done rather nicely too   now  now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick  but sadly there s no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard  if lacking but it s more then decent for such low budget flick  there are one or two creative deaths  but the rest are systematic  the killer wasn t bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought  well the smart ass attitude didn t sit well with me  another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut away editing  out of place soundtrack and kimble rendall s direction lacked execution and was pretty careless  but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badness   the imagination matches the budget that s for sure  but heck this lousy slasher wasn t trying to be anything else  pure schlock that s slightly amusing
