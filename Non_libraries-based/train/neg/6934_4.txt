ok  so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in    i pity the fools who still think so  its absolute rubbish   the story is just   ridiculous  the characters are absurd caricatures   but this film is not meant to satirise  im sure its meant to be a serious drama isn t it   dean and others  are too old for their parts  people say dean is great in this film  and well  maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could ve  his character is meant to be   or   or so  but dean was a   year old man when he made this film  seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a   year old boy  its pathetic   natalie wood is gorgeous  but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing  it sets a bad precedent for the film  and for the rest of it  you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along   it may ve been good for its time  but  really  its drivel   it must ve just been hype about dean s death that has over inflated the reputation of this film
