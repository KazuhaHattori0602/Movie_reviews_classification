i m always suprised on how different all people are and how for almost every movie you get both extremes  people who think it s the best movie and people who think it s the worst   stigmata wouldn t be the worst movie i ve ever seen  but it s up there  first of all the sound  the producers spent more time on the soundtrack than the editing  it was so loud when the soundtrack was playing and no one was talking and then when patrica was talking in her monotone voice  she could hardly be heard   i usually like patrica and gaberial  but they were both flat in this movie  patrica had basically   emotions  quiet  in great pain  or really angry she has stigmata  the first was the predominate one  the second involved screaming pain  the third involving raising her voice  it was loudness that distiguished the three and not emotion   maybe i missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots everyone was talking about  or maybe i was distracted by the terrible filming and mtv like style  when you watch a   minute video you need fast cuts and slow motion to convey a quick story  in a   hour feature film  it s nauseating  i fail to see the meaning of her seeing that women across the steet and dropping a child  and no pittsburg does not rain that often   i think maybe a real story  with something to say could have been intended  but all the budget was spent on buying music and the equipment to do slow rain drop shots and renting that gorgous apartment that ms  arquett lived in that they ended up firing the guy with the story
