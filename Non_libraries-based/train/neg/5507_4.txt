this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula  intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans  in his view   the usual wackiness ensues with the human  bridges  eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home  along the way he also gets the girl  hannah   this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while   pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view
