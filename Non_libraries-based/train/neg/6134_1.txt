if i could say it was better than gymkata  i at least felt my money was not totally wasted   then i saw steven segal s on deadly ground   this movie should see a resurrection though on mst  k  if santa claus conquers the martians could make tom servo s head explode  one wonders what mayhem this movie could cause   there is a very good reason why kurt thomas never had a movie career   the writers of this dreck should be forced to wear placards every day of their lives that say  bitch slap me  i was a writer on gymkata
