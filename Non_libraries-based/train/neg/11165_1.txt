i mean  really  either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie  it s stupid  ridiculous and just not funny at all   since i saw the preview i knew it wasn t going to be a great movie  i just didn t think it was gonna be that bad   what happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie  when the actors didn t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny  now we find ourselves with movies like this one  borat  little men  scary movie   where i could not find the funny parts   just skip this piece of garbage  p s   sorry for my english
