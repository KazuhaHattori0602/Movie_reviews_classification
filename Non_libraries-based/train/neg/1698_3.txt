lynch  the man has some really great stuff  he knows how to disturb us  then reward us by getting us think in different ways  this  however  is altogether different  dumbland s reward is   absurd comedy  earned by enduring   stupidity  i may have laughed once  but somewhere around episode   i just started watching on fast forward  didn t miss a thing  i felt relieved when it ended  and that s part of the point with this series  it s an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations  rounded out with annoying animation  voices and sound  but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile
