in   lucio fulci released his film zombi  however  due to the earlier import of george romero s dawn of the dead  which had gone by that name for its italian release  it was retitled to zombi    which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie  continuing this theme  the second zombi film  which would have been called zombi   was then consequently titled zombi   in the uk  the original zombi film  that is  zombi   was titled  zombie flesh eaters  to continue this theme  the second zombi film  zombi   was then titled  zombie flesh eaters   for its uk release   are you following all this  so if zombie flesh eaters was fulci s dawn  then is   his day of the dead  while this is only a flippant observation  this tale of military compounds  helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance   some of fulci s european direction compels in a film like this  but the acting  dubbing and exposition heavy script are absolutely horrendous  its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext  while there s an  unintentionally  hilarious birds homage  combining this last element with mor  s rock is not a good idea  for some reason i couldn t stop thinking of time of the apes  q v  the whole time i was watching this  this is obviously not a good thing   while there s nothing here to rival topless scuba diving  shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter  fulci s misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner s mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood  his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing  both themes are combined when a woman s face is ripped off  first by one zombie  then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman s stomach   production wise  this is obviously a step up from zombi  coming five years later   nine years in worldwide release terms  but without the original s low key charm it struggles  while stefano mainetti s music is inappropriate and uninspired  fabio frizzi s score was one of the best things about the   movie  here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tyler s  holding out for a hero  in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest  and roger and kenny  two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious   we re out of ammunition  to a stalling gun is a particular standout  but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves  low key or not  fulci s original had truly magnificent  rotting zombies  skull faces  worms in eye sockets  they really were something to behold  by contrast  this dull follow up opts for the more traditional  men with a bit of paint on their faces  option    the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny  while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device  not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first  this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal    it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes  the rest filmed by bruno mattei  i m fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous  flying zombie head  scene  and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave  unfortunately  however  it s his name that s above the film title on releases  so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through  on that scale then it s a major setback for him  for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all  that of being boring
