  to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it  i will tell you anything   i love bad movies  and i love horror and i love new inventive movies  i even love horror porn stuff like hostel  which some reviewers claimed this was like  but obviously they only thought so cause roger bart was in this and hostel   but this may be the number   most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie ever made   and before you disregard this review  this is coming from someone who not only sat through the entire premiere of house of the dead  but actually bought a copy of it
