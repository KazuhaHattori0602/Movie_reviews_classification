i m dumbfounded  yes that s right  i m really caught here  no way did i find it awful  but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency  the idea behind such a trim  minimal low budget indie production isn t bad  but it s a confused muddle and in the end didn t do anything for me  it s amateurish and simple  it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style  we have the documentary laced  hand held  camera moving everywhere  despite never leaving the van  and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out  lately you kind of get use to it  but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating  keeping it still will help  the context has little groundwork  which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads  at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight  scared  they flee and not too long that one light suv appears behind them  soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror  spending most of the time playing out a drawn out  noisy and relentless cat and mouse game    as for being disturbing
 i guess that depends  some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain  desperation and demented brutality  with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects  but also i found myself snickering too  in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush  but hardly believable  the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe  despite obviously they should be  watch how blood runs freely  but it s not entirely convincing and can get dull  the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive  we get screaming  spewing  bleeding  running  cursing  body fluids and so on  quite unpleasant details followed too  with little really to do  it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up  too many cringe moments arose from it  and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in  it was about set pieces  waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough  helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern    the performances  jennifer barnett  angela brunda  danielle lilley  sandra paduch and mia yi are workman like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script s weaknesses in its character foundation   veronica garcia s flipped out  bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was something
 yeah something  her character s real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent  i guess being psychotic was good enough  now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack  terrible techno music  to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score  it never felt overdone or got in the way  but it did stick out like a sore thumb  co directors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources  but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle  maybe it was enjoyable to make  but watching it just wasn t the case
