the worst thing about crush is not that it s acted pretty bad  or that the plot is virtually non existent  and it s not even that bad that the camerawork could have been better   no  the worst part of this movie is that it has a few absolutely brilliant moments that keep you hoping that there are more to come   but in the end  it s too little  too late  if you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearjerking scenes of   women crying and hugging and talking about babies and marriage   then by all means  don t miss it   i myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie  and as a result i had a pretty horrible time  the few absolutely brilliant jokes can not make up for the rest of it   the verdict    guilty of wasting my time
