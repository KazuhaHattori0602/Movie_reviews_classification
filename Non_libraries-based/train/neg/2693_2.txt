  although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story   one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the  s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to  year old s they barely know  but i doubt it   one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations  but my experience has been  more often than not  teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world   one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the pungent oder of stroptomycin   the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes   and not detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake  but i think not   one may believe that  something year old troublemakers can enter into  and hang around inside  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this   one final nit  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome  but because it was never detailed  each reference distracts from each scene   this movie did not ring true for me
