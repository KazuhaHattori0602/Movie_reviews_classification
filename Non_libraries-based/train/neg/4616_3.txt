this movie has not aged well  maybe it s just the impact and artful characterization  acting  and directing that we ve seen with the sopranos  but i just viewed prizzi s honor for the first time  on dvd  alone   the experience of watching it with an audience   years ago must have been quite different  but i have to say  i was just appalled at the ending  not just the violence of it  but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending   i enjoy a good shocker  but this seemed so out of character  also  when was this move supposed to be set  the cars all seemed like they were from the  s  and yet the world trade center towers  completed in   were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes   another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person   somehow  mid s audiences found this film charming and funny  mid eighties  meet the late oughts  only of you can live
