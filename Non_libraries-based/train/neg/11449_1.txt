when viewing a movie as silly as  hot rod  one must sit back  relax  and alter one s intellectual capacity to a like state   which is  in this case  a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy  with a brief runtime of   minutes  this film was long past drawn out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes   jokes that came at a minority and weren t even funny in the first place   hot rod s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as  s cult hit  napoleon dynamite  though it s much more contrived and comes without any of the laughter  in fact  the movie s blatant desperation to be compared to  napoleon dynamite  is scornful and offensive  and left me ticked off  instead of just being annoyed   the movie  if one were compelled enough to call it such  poses a paltry story that puts self proclaimed stuntman rod kimble before us  with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses  one more than his idol evel knievel jumped  so we re told by rod  and raising   dollars for his stepfather s impending life saving heart operation  all so that he can fight his stepfather  once recovered  and gain his respect
 because in order to gain one s respect  one must first fight them  huh  whatever  each character is no more interesting than rod s stick on mustache  and from the film s opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion  each scene played like a nonsensical  and terribly unfunny  snl skit   which  with the addition of an extra   minutes  is  essentially  what  hot rod  strives to be   the film s star  andy samberg  contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip drop of his comedic capabilities  unfortunately   rather  realistically   his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five year old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee pee gags  and if that s disappointing  pull a chair  hide your face in your hands  and brace yourself for the real blow  he is the film s humor  to rescue them of their mortification  i ll willingly omit the ghastliness of samberg s co stars  roles and leave the second third of the lonely island team  director akiva schaffer  to his non existent talent as a director
 or a comedian  basically  every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash course comedy is perfectly portrayed here  and done so arrogantly  as though the film would be funnier that way  trick yourself into believing that there s even a single laugh in this heap  or treat yourself to another movie   any other movie
