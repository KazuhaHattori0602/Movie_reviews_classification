the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie    clich s abound  seriously  awful  twists  are everywhere     the narrative jumps around in time  which would be fine if done well  but it s not     lame characters that don t develop so much as either remain utterly static  or drastically change for no good reason     big one  horrible acting  over the top from nearly every person   the following are some of the best points from the movie    the lead is damn good looking   as i see it  there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie  a  people who can sit through   minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive   b  people who often think to themselves   i like hollywood dreck rife with clich s and overacting  but if only i could watch it in korean  there s a lot of good korean cinema out there  so why waste your time with garbage
