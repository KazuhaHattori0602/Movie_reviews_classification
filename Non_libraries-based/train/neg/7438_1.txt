this movie is an utter waste of time  the plot is awful  the dialogue is awful   the acting is ok  but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with  the photography and some of the special effects are ok  too  but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch  there is no logical progression to the story  the story line is utter nonsense  it isn t even scary  for a movie to be scary  there has to be at least a small element of believability  this movie has no believability at all   there are only three characters in the movie  each character is shallow and has no personality    most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done  or at most mediocre   i hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie
