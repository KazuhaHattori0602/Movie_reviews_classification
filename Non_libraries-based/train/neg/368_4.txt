this movie is really goofy  i saw it as an   year old  and even then i thought it was pretty ridiculous  i would only recommend this film to kids under the age of   i really didn t care for it  but i do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of  such as   does money buy happiness   should i lie  to my parents  about things i think they wouldn t approve of   does money buy friendships   is money everything   shouldn t i tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me  granted  these are very unrealistic situations  but i do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children  maybe they should watch this video as well  in order to show scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt
