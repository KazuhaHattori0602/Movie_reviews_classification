in order to avoid confusion  let me clarify a couple of points  i am not a red neck  i am not even a moderate nor a conservative  quite on the contrary  i am a radical  a libertarian  i m not a wasp either  i was not even born in the states   jorge luis borges used to say that there are some kind of folk who do not feel poetry  and that these sad people usually earn their living teaching poetry  this movie was made by and for people who do not feel poetry  by and for show offs  and i dare say  by and for people who have no sense of decency or  for that matter  respect for other people s life or death  especially when the victims are thought to be mostly  bloody imperialists  killed in yankee soil  i even find the original marketing idea of the eleven episodes of eleven minutes  nine seconds and one frame as particularly hideous and repulsive  just plain awful  why didn t they assign a budget of as many dollars per episode as individuals were brutally murdered in the attack  the whole idea rests somewhere between mere stupidity and reckless fascism  anybody who is serious about film making  and serious about life and death  should have angrily declined to participate in this recollection of innuendoes and non sequiturs  with two exceptions  the episode of burkina faso   almost amusing   and the one from india  which documents the story of a man who was unfairly and wrongly investigated in relation to the attack  on the basis that afterwards he didn t return home and that he was an american muslim  and  truth be told  when the facts were known he was honored as a hero  all other nine episodes  essentially and extremely boring and emotionless  can be listed in two different categories   first   i don t care about the thousands of victims  americans  foreigners  children  youngsters  adults  old timers  and can be resumed in pure boredom and lack of emotion  makhmalbaf s  iran  lelouch s  france    i m afraid i m going to commit an heresy since it s lelouch s  but maybe  his episode might be considered built upon an idea which could be regarded as almost original  tanovic s  bosnia herzegovina  gonzalez inarritu s  mexico  gita s  israel  penn s  usa    second   the bloody yankees deserve it  and can be resumed in frustration and hatred  chahine  egypt  vindicates the suicide bombers  loach  uk  considers the   reckless attacks were some kind of punishment for the alleged support of the usa to the chilean dictatorship headed by the serial killer augusto pinochet  in fact someone should inform mr  loach that the victims of pinochet were not related to al qaida and that chile is a south american country which sole existence mr  bin laden should have ignored  he ought to be informed too that the american government sanctions against the chilean dictatorship were harder than any other ciountrie s  and  imamura  japan  windingly points out that wwii is related the attack to the wtc  imamura has at least been coherent in this  the supposed cause effect linking is entirely nonsensical  which plays well with his episode including a man who believes himself to be a snake  it pretends to be obscure  it is  instead  quite ludicrous   there s some kind of error shared by many  including some americans  and it consists in the belief that this movie wasn t commercially screened in the states because of some kind of censorship  nothing further from the truth  this movie wasn t screened in the states because it is a complete fiasco  a fiasco of the wackyest kind  even in buenos aires  where peronism and other forms of fascism are nearest and dearest to the hearts of a sizable number of its inhabitants  and anti americanism is in vogue  the movie was screened in living rooms hurriedly converted into theaters  and was applauded by a very select public  the usual sad few who routinely lend their applause to other equally  quaint  spectacles  like the sight of a mcdonald s fast food restaurant or  perchance  an elderly jew  being burnt to ashes
