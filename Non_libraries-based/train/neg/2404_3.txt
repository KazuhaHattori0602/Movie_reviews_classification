man  was i disappointed     adam arkin is more whiny than ross geller from  friends      a great cast is wasted  kenneth mars  alan arkin  ed mcmahon  pat morita  louis nye  with this amateurish script     the movie suffers from horrible pacing  it jumps around through in a jumbled  confusing manner     the story doesn t even make sense  why does he want to break the football streak  what about the stupid violin music  none of it is explained     it s not even funny  it s like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv  saying  lookit me  lookit me i m being funny  this was a bad attempt at making another  love at first bite   i like larry cohen movies  but man he failed here  i couldn t wait for the credits to roll  horribly disappointed
