i m not a big fan of rom coms at the best of times  a few have been quite good  check of dream for an insomniac  but this one is just more of the same but less   with a running time of  min  i expect more than   laugh every  mins  the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out lee s character   all i can say is avoid  i gaurentee there is at least   other movies on the shelf that deserve you      of out    and only cos i m a big lee fan
