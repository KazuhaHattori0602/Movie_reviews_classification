this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by   matches  the hardcore match between edge and mick foley  also vince mcmahon against shaun michaels  the main event between cena and triple h was a complete washout and to be honest i nearly fell asleep it was so actionless  the casket match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke  if you are really a big fan of the wwe and have missed the early days of the wwf and the wrestlemanias   and   you ll probably love this  but i found that this wrestlemania left a lot to be desired
