if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in   this is the movie for you  but you ll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins  too  see my remarks on my girl   for the reference   indulgent admission  i approached my girl   with cynicism and annoyance  having just viewed its predecessor  but as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother  my girl   made me look  with its theme of searching for mother   put another way  anything i liked about my girl   had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl   but relating to a protagonist who asks  like so many adoptees   who s my mama  and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe  i ll be sure to make my own movie about it   people are listless  movies should not be listless  my girl    like my girl   is just listless   avoid unless you re a complete sap who s comforted by a series of small annoyances
