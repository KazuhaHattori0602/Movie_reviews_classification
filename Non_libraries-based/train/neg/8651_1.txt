i watched the first   minutes  thinking it was a real documentary  with an irritatingly overly dramatic  on camera  producer   when i realized it was all staged i thought  why would i want to waste my time watching this junk  so i turned it off and came online to warn other people  the characters don t act in a believable way  too much immature emotion  for a guy to travel half way around the world into a war torn country  he acted like a kid  and i don t believe it was because  his character was so upset about the trade center bombings   very trite and stupid   have you seen  city of lost children  french dark fantasy film about a guy who kidnaps kids and steals their dreams  i liked it
