 the hazing  is one of them films i always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on imdb  yes  that s how shallow i am  i don t care if ten million people call it a crap movie  the poster looks awesome so i guess i ll just have to see it 
 now   the hazing  can somewhat be described like its alternate title  curious  the poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites  but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller  first of all  there s something very wrong with the tagline on the old vhs box i watched  it says  he had good grades  a good girl and good buddies 
 until they put him through the hazing  that s not the case  actually  protagonist gilbert lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship  it takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only  buddy  he has is a very nerdy charles martin smith  still with hair in this film  both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious  delts  fraternity  but during their hazing exam   in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies   barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg  when lewis returns with the other frat boys  barney froze to death already  together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski trip  with barney s body hidden in the cafeteria freezer  lewis has to cover for him so that barney s absence doesn t look suspicious  the set up of  the hazing  is quite original and potentially innovative  but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better  the tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie  even a black one  but on the other hand there aren t any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills  neither  the soundtrack is cheerful and full of light headed tunes  but that s nearly not enough to make this film a comedy  around an hour into the film  the plot also runs out of steam and idea  and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside  i didn t like the final twist  because it s quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after  though admittedly after   the hazing  is not a complete waste of time  but still i m glad i found an ex rental tape at a friend s house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released dvd
