this movie is simply not worth the time or money spent  full of clich s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense   i cant believe that so many people have given this awful movie a   my guess is they are stooges of the movie maker    if i could give this movie a zero  i would  too bad imdb doesn t allow that    the only reason i watched it because i went with a friend who really wanted to see it  whats sad is that i never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet i felt short changed  take my word  don t waste your   on this piece of trash  the only entertainment i got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name  in all  highly not recommended
