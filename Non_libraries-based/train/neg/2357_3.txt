let s hope this is the final nightmare  this is the epitome of a good thing gone bad  okay  there is still some enjoyment to be had  but only in the most mundane sense  rachel talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise  had been on the production staff and produced even  i don t know what she was thinking  but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by  tom and roseanne arnold  i wish i had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote directed this disappointing piece of garbage  she even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror  with the contrived use of a  d ending  aren t those glasses nifty  and you get to keep them  it s the equivalent of  you just spent   making me rich  here s   cents  now  don t you feel special  sorry  but for me  it just did not make me feel special    and freddy s had yet another face lift  this one was for the worst  i think  all the beautiful artistry that went into his  look  in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper  less detailed set of prosthetics  he looks   less like the burn victim he is supposed to be  and more like he has a skin disorder  changing the lead s makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor  but wait  they ve done that  and done that  so i guess it doesn t matter  but it mattered to me  freddy is no longer scary  he s just   another low rent monster like the leprechaun    it s more a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises  riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one liners and clever repartee  sadly  it fell short on both accounts    so there s nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh  because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film    it rates a   from   the fiend
