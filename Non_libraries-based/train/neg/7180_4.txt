this is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director honda  with more evidently elaborate sets    though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them  witness the giant bats and rodents on display  it also utilizes a surprising number of american actors  joseph cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill at ease and frail  but  then  his character is supposed to be   years old  an innocuous richard jaeckel is the photographer hero while  as chief villains  we get cesar romero and patricia medina  both essentially campy  as i ve often said  i grew up watching english language films dubbed in italian
but hearing hollywood actors in japanese is another thing entirely    latitude zero feels like a juvenile version of a typical jules verne adventure  and is fairly entertaining on that level  indeed  it s preferable to honda s low brow variations on the monsters on the rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set up in this case  the plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by romero   he was intended to establish himself in the underwater  technologically advanced city devised by cotten  to which the world s foremost minds are being recruited  we re treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs  but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on romero s cave   in fact  cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits  via flames and laser emitted from his glove  must surely count as the nadir of his acting career  the other elder in the cast  romero  is more in his element   after all  he had been the joker in the batman tv series and movie of the  s  cotten has a scantily clad blonde physician on his team  and is assisted by a hulking asian  romero  on the other hand  is flanked by an oriental femme fatale   who  however  ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts  the girl s brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condor
which is among the phoniest looking creatures you ever saw  apparently  a  disc set of this one from media blasters streets on this very day
