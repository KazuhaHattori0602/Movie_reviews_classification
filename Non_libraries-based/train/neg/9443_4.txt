if one sits down to watch unhinged  it is probably because its advertisements  video boxes  whatever  scream that it was banned in the uk for over   years  as virtually every video nasty does  it s true  exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy  being an exploitation fan  however  none of this was new to me  the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk don t necessarily make me want to watch it  in fact  the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are  how i came to viewing this then is simple  it promised gore and it was only   the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween  but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts  i did force myself  however  to watch it all in one sitting  because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it  so anyway  after   minutes of unhinged  i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence  i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique   the layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the  s  there s unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore  that s about it  anyway  it starts with a group of three attractive co eds crashing their car on the way to a concert  though two of them  terry and nancy  are okay  one  gloria  is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie  they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion  that happens to have no phone  of course  with rather strange occupants  marion is a middle aged woman with a man hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them  echoes of psycho  she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods  because her mother s hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house  after hanging with marion for awhile  terry  our  hero  and nancy decide they must contact their parents  despite everyone s warnings  nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone  her fate is not hard to predict  after that  we see gloria again  who is then promptly butchered with an ax  when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room  she decides something isn t right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends  that may be easier said than done  however  with crazy carl lurking around
   after viewing unhinged  i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end  normally  i do not drag other people s opinions into my reviews  especially when they contradict my views  but in this case  i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention  this is because in actuality  the film crawls  normally for the slow building tactic to work  the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger  oh sure  we see two of them get murdered  but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom  we are aware that there s a killer on the loose  but this is only focused on three times in the film  that means there s no reason to fear for the victims  instead  the film s events are explained not by the actions of the characters  but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking  if there s one thing i can assure you from watching this  it s that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for   minutes are very tedious  none of this is helped by the atrocious acting  it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience   of course  i d be a liar if i said there wasn t one part of the movie that i enjoyed  specifically  the ending was one of the best i ve ever seen in a slasher film  you just do not expect that to happen  just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular  ah  i won t spoil it for you  nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow moving film  but it definitely will get your attention  other than that  the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material  but it s not like you couldn t tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film  anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed  however  those are the only scenes of gore present  that and  of course  no one scene can save an entire movie  i normally preach the doctrine that as long as there s action  the worse a movie is  the better it gets  unhinged only grasps one part of this concept  the whole film just feels luke warm  there s potential alright  but the director either wasn t experienced enough to make it work or just didn t know what the hell he was doing
