when i borrowed this movie from a friend  thankfully i did not buy it  on the package  which truly looked bad and ugly  was printed  the ultimate vampire horror  after watching it i thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself  the  story  begins when a teenager  surprise  is chased by some vampire zombie creatures   lighting  sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video on a ten year old vhs system if not worse  i gave the movie a   out of   and only because the promo t shirts looked kind of cool  i don t want to dis  film students or splatter movies generally but i ve seen braindead and i ve seen a  dollar budget movie from students that was ten times better than this crap
