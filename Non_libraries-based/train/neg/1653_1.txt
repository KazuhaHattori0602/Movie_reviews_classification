it just seems bizarre that someone read this script  and thought   this is funny  i mean  it s so hilarious it just has to be made  who was this person  is he or she the person really responsible for this  are they the one s who owe me for my time  more so than the director writer   this film stinks in most every way possible  there s no one shred of good dialogue  and not one likable character  and the story   i prefer the  nd worst movie ever  hulk hogan s  no hold s barred  to this by quite a considerable degree  it seems almost shakespearen in comparison   the ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes  and it s still under   minutes  the outtakes include cast members laughing at the  hilarious  mistakes they ve made  and things that went wrong on the set of this  comedy  glad to see someone laughing in someway  with some connection to this  film   nothing in this film is funny  nothing  it just goes on  and on  it s truly that lame  i love films that are so bad they re good  this is so bad it s something  but i don t know what  and hopefully will never find out   amanda peet doesn t suck outright  and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film  but  that really means little   avoid at all costs
