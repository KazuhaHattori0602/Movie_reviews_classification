alright  i got passed the horrible acting  i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren t moving  i got passed the weaves  i got passed the colored contacts   this is what killed it for me  in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing  lisa raye and monica calhoun stand up and  and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying   whoa  whoa  whoa  hold up  let s chill out here for a hot second  i am a fan of the western movie genre  and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwood s movies   if anyone thinks this movie deserves over a   rating  please tell me another movie that s worse than gang of roses   i m through
