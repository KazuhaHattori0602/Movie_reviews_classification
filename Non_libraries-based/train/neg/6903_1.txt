probably new zealands worst movie ever made  the jokes they are not funny  used from other movies   just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is a great cast  the story is uninteresting   boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do   times before  i watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand   minutes of it    this movie sucks  do not watch it    watch paint dry instead
