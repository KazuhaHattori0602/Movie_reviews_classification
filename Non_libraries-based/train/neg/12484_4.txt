woosh
  man
 what can i say   the opening scene  maybe  we see a bunch of mongoloid barbarians with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins  they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl  the dude runs off  the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl  but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her  then  the dude  still on the run  sees a horse and tries to steal it  suddenly
 a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears  saying  that s my horse  the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance  the mongoloids arrive  deathstalker kills all of them  including the dude  on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score  this is supposed to be a swords   sorcery flick  so what s with the  arriba trompettos  and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts  he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it  she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker  just when they are about to get down to it  this old dude appears  interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker  and a possible perfect ending for a short film   now tell me
 isn t that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie  or any other male viewer would say  this is going to be one hell of a good movie  the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony  deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkar   aside from decapitations  dismemberment  random bloodshed  retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights  this film also contains a massive amount of t ts   a  shots  i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count  after   points  not even halfway into the movie  i had to give up counting  it was distracting me from the rest of the movie  and the rest of the movie was worth it  totally crazy stuff  check out this mutant cat worm like creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers  and here s an interesting question  what would you do if a man in a woman s body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife  the answer is simple  you slap him around a bit  take away the knife and then try to rape him  then you discover that he s actually not a woman  so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room  it works out well  i tell you  deathstalker does it too  and the deathstalker way  is the right way   deathstalker is a wonderful movie  really  as pointed out in other comments  the villains are vile  the women are delicious  there s blood  sex  violence  rape and tasty chicken  there s a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating  slashing and hacking the crap out of each other  my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer  used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp  and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthog head  reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi  i won t reveal how the movie ends  but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a  way dismemberment is thrown into the movie s climax   and of course  there s a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie  see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road  and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass  no road  see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer s head magically change sides within the same scene  on shot has it on the left side of his head  the other on the right  well  after all  munkar is a magician  it s that  or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like  continuity  simply don t exist   as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other   installments in this series  i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass  i am prepared  though  to give it the maximum amount of minimal points  just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow  deathstalker might be a superbly fun  trashy   sleazy conan rip off  it also is an abominable movie
