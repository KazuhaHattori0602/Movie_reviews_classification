i m a big porsche fan  and the car was the best star in this film   haim  the now dried up drug abusing child star of the  s is bland as per usual  and commenting on back up from minor characters actors would be pointless  needless to say they were all very average  it s a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the  s   with some weird clothes  some good shots of the colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot   all in all  please don t waste your time watching this unless you love  s movies  corey haim  or like myself  love old school porsches  this one in particular looks great  because life s too short to watch crappy movies
