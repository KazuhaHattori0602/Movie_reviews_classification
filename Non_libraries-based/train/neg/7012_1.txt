me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a  premiere surprise  that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in denmark  we sat through the  st hour or so and then we left  the point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era  and club   but it did so at the expence of character development  of which there was none  and plot of which there was little   seldom have i been so indifferent to the characters in a movie   the music was good though  so if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that  ies mood i guess it is ok  but don t expect to get a plot of believable characters
