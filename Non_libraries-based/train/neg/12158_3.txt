  may seem far fetched  but there really was a real life story  of a man who had an affair with a woman  who found out where he and his new wife were staying  and she killed the wife  making it look like a murder rape   in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him  so she quit her job in wisconsin  and moved to minnesota   last i heard she was in a mental institution  security prison   she was still wearing the  engagement ring  that she has purchased for herself  and had told everyone that he had bought it for her   the events took place in a small town in wisconsin  and the murder happened in minnesota   there even was a feature story in  people  magazine  spring of   i want to say on page   i remember this as i was in college at the time  and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital
