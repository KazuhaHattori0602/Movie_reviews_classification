a short review but   avoid at all costs  a thorough waste of  mins  at the end of the film i was none the wiser as to what had actually happened  it s full of cameos  stephen fry  mins  jack dee   secs  the  philadelphia  girls  and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn t make any sense  whether the story just got lost in the edit i don t now but jeez   put on a dvd instead or go to bed and get some rest     out of    for the cameos and a morris minor car chase
