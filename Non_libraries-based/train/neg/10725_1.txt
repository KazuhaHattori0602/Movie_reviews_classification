as much as i dislike saying  me too  in response to other comments   it s completely true that the first   minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following    having been banned somewhere doesn t make a film watchable  just because it doesn t resemble a hollywood product does not make it credible   worse yet  in addition to no discernible plot  other than there are lots of muddy places in russia and many people  even very old women  drink lots of vodka  a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating i m in to my second package of rolaids   as for spoilers   well  the film is so devoid of any narrative thread i couldn t write one if i tried   don t waste your time or money  and don t confuse this with good russian cinema
