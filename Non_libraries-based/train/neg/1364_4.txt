the more i think about it  there was nothing redeeming about this  movie  i saw it   months ago  so my memory might have made it  worse than it was  but i do know it was at least as bad as a   out of      after seeing the movie  i met the director  he seemed so clueless  as to what he was doing or what he had done  and as far as i  could tell  he didn t care for the film either  even he agreed that he  didn t really know what he was doing  and he was forced to do  certain things because it was filmed digitally    i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it  built for itself    people all have to be connected in some way  how  can we get from point  a  to point  b  so in order get from the  prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they    minutes on each character s relationship to another person  it  makes one feel choked by the   demensional  badly drawn  characters   i just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie  steve  bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing  that s it  as i  say    out of
