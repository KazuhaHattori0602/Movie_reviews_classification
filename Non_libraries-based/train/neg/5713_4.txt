there s nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead   it s only my opinion  but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable  intelligent characters  as far as likability is concerned  the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple  nicely done  unfortunately  they are stupid beyond belief  let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker     after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you  be sure to tell him what hotel you re staying at when you drop him off     beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses  thereby allowing him to press charges of assault     don t bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume  for no apparently good reason  that the cops were bribed by him     while trying to escape  let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her     after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife  be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one on one  no point in being unfair  right    now  i d never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions  but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it s effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety  since they are victims of their own doing  this kills the enjoyability of the entire film    in case you were wondering  the scriptwriters didn t stop with dim witted characters  since they themselves are surely dim witted for writing this crapfest  they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window     the stalker kills a cop inside a police station   while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away     the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people  yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior     the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being     the  suspense  scenes had no imagination whatsoever  in fact  some scenes were direct rip offs from american movies   the only positive is the decapitation near the end  which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife  it s too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field   truly  the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves  better yet  they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence
