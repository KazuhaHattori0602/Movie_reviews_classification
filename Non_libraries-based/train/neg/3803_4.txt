the movie seems disjointed and overall  poorly written  the screenplay moves along as if   different people wrote it  and none of them were communicating with each other  apparently they wanted to take a page from a miracle on  th street  the original  type film  but it is done in such a poor way that the movie falls apart  this film is for only the very young  and even they will see the fact that whoever scripted it knows little to nothing about baseball  such as      when the angels are in dead last place  the owner doesn t seem to care  nor is he bothered by the fact his manager just got into a fight with his pitcher   on the mound   or that he punched the team s play by play announcer on live tv  however  when the team is one game from winning the division  he gets bent out of shape over a story  sourced by a   year old  that the manager is getting help from a kid who claims to see real angels  what sounds worse  a losing violent out of control manager whose team has lost   in a row  or a winning coach on the verge of the playoffs that is acting a bit eccentric and is helping foster kids  the owner s reaction makes no sense  and he s moved to change his mind by maggie and her  straight out of clich  land  speech during a news conference     the angels are supposed to be playing for the division in the final weekend series against the white sox  however at the end of the game the announcer s keep saying the angels  won the pennant  the pennant is not decided until someone wins the league championship  not the regular season division title     whitt bass  the goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the angels losing streak   then is the starting pitcher   the very next day     mel clark  tony danza  is said in the ninth inning to have thrown   pitches  in a low scoring ballgame  typically in low scoring games  the pitch count is much lower than this  usually around   pitches      al  the angel says at the end  championships have to be won on their own  even though he and his angels have been manipulating and fixing games throughout the whole second half of the season   i could go on and on  as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written   for younger kids  under   this movie may be entertaining  it s too bad   done right this could have been a classic  done wrong like this and it s a forgettable mess that will forever live as a uhf cable saturday morning washout
