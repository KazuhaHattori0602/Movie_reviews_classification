 land of plenty  is not a film  it is a tombstone for the directorial career of german director wim wenders   many felt it in  the million dollar hotel  and now  land of plenty  makes it perfectly clear  not only has wenders lost it  he s actually turned into a bad director  creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes   one might argue that the  time you lose it  comes for every director  but wenders  case is extreme  it s as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again   only to get sloppish results   in a few words  this film does not deserve your time
