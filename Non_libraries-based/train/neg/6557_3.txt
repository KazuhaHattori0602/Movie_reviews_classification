really  they spelled it brain in the credits  not brian   ok  they didn t have the budget for a spell checker  all the production money went for great old cars  there are at least two packards visible here  one is a darin convertible  a nice yellow packard convertible   the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations  old cameras  an exterior of ciro s  street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there  poorly written and directed   my dvd says it runs for   minutes  approximately  it was more like   minutes  it came to an end without reaching a conclusion  there was a collision but no conclusion  the movie just smashed up against the credits    cents for this  i paid   cents for this  i could have bought   cans of cat food and watched my cat s face as he emoted more excitement   for a few seconds in the ciro s scene after darren mcgavin gets a phone call  it looked like  maybe  this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film  then it just sat there   the young latin actor played by steven bauer  tony montoya  could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here  this cast could have made a good film   i think if they cut brian s part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the packards and lose the band and add a johnny otis sound alike band  then they got something   here kitty  kitty   tom willett
