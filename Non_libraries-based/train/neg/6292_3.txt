i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the   movie  bachelor party  starring tom hanks  is this movie even an official sequel  this movie is lacking in every department and you re obviously better off not watching it   for a comedy this movie simply isn t good or funny enough  it relies mostly on the character s their stereotypical assessments  rather then the movie actually features some good  original and funny moments   of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages  you just keep waiting for things to finally start off  there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it s something non existent  i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out   it s basically a typical teenage comedy  with lots of sex jokes and nudity  only without the teenage main characters  which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless  the movie makes some really wrong jokes  that are misplaced for any type of movie   i regret ever watching this
