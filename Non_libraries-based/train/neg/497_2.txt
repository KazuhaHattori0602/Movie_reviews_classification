this is a really dumb movie  it could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting  but it just isn t   some aliens hear the broadcast of war of the worlds when a small country radio station plays it on halloween  they come to earth to kill humans  but instead of killing  they make people their slaves and act goofy  the front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space not really what they do  these aren t party aliens  they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices  the alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the jack nicholson rip off alien who always wears his sunglasses  other than the aliens  the acting is terrible  the writing is obviously meant for children  because every character is written like a kid   this is a dumb movie  that only children will appreciate  maybe   my rating    out of     mins  pg for mild language
