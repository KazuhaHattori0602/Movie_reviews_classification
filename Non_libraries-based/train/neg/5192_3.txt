it doesn t take long to see why code name  diamond head didn t make it onto the network schedules  the tv pilot movie doesn t get past the credits before it s obvious just how bad it s going to be  maybe i missed something  because the plot didn t make a whole lot of sense  based on what i got out of the muddled mess  a terrorist or thief or something named  tree   ian mcshane  goes to hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon  the world s dullest secret agent  johnny paul  roy thinnes  is out to stop him  there might have been more  but trust me   it really doesn t matter anyway   action movies should have action  suspenseful moments should have suspense  and dramatic moments should have drama  there s none of that in code name  diamond head  i ve seen others use the word  turgid  to describe this made for tv snoozer   and it s better than any one word description i can come up with  none of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about  and roy thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable  his charisma is just slightly north of a slug  ian mcshane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it  but unfortunately for everyone else involved  it doesn t appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member  now if mcshane had been cast in the series lead  well then you might have had something   i m quickly discovering that these gawd awful  s made for tv movies make great mystery science theater   episodes  and that goes double if quinn martin was involved  very funny stuff from mike and the bots  so while i may only give the movie a   i rate episode   a   on my mst k rating scale
