it is not often i watch a film that is as dreadful as this one  i continued to watch  every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously  well  as seriously as this genre requests   the acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich d  if a film was made in    for example  and had the quality of hide   seek  cord  in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive  as it happens  this film was made in   and i have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one   definitely not for the serious movie goer   [not worth a rating]
