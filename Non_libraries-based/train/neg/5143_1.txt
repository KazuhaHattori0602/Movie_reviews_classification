even if   of people that has seen this movie is brazilian  i ll keep up with the english since it is the language of this website   this movie is a piece of cr p  worst acting i have seen for a loooong time  the kids are terrible  specially the boy  this was the first time i saw someone with less facial expression than arnold schwarzenegger  and one single voice tone  like a   years old kid reading in front of the class  how can someone so bad be the main actor of a movie   the storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better  she is   yrs old  it is so simple it could be written in a napkin and told in   minutes   there are only three possibilities for someone enjoy this movie    you are a pre teen    you have been so brainwashed by globo s stupidities that you think that anything that has the globo s seal is awesome    you have a serious brain damage   avoid at all costs   a shame to the brazilian movie scene
