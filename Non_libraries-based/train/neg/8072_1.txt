 a possible spoiler or two      soul survivors  is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever  nothing makes sense at all  there s some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead  the entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that don t really tie together  by the end of the film     tha acting is non existent  the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing  it just makes the movie even harder to watch    i kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came  definitely the worst film of the year    stars
