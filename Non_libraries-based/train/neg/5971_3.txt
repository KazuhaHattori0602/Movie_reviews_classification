i was talked into watching this movie by a friend who blubbered on about what a cute story this was   yuck   i want my two hours back  as i could have done so many more productive things with my time like  for instance  twiddling my thumbs  i see nothing redeeming about this film at all  save for the eye candy aspect of it      and that s being generous
