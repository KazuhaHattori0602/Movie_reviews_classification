what do you get when you mix a lump of clich s with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you don t care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clich s and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget  why  you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made  i m referring  of course  to domino   here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this movie    ooh  wow  the storyline is told out of sequence  that hasn t been done a billion times before  and much more skillfully than in this movie    wow  look at all of the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate transitions  the director is trying so hard to make things look arty and to establish a visual style  it s just too bad that none of these effects add anything to the movie or make sense with the scenes they re in  and it s also too bad that most of them come across as irritating    i ve heard that exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before    i ve seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before    this one too    uh  didn t they reveal this  plot twist  about half an hour ago  was that supposed to be surprising    if this movie is supposed to be showing a  tough chick  going around kicking ass  when why doesn t she do very much of it    i can t believe how unoriginal this dialogue is    how long is this thing  i feel like i ve been watching it for over four hours already    i have no idea what just happened  but also  i don t particularly feel motivated to try to figure it out    is this over yet    i want my money back    the songs in this soundtrack feel so misused here    it s ironic that all of the cursing they use actually detracts from the impact of each one    ugh   and  finally   i might have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me   in summation  this movie is a failure in nearly every aspect  avoid watching it at all costs  if your house is on fire and this movie is playing in the only room that isn t flammable  you should seriously consider being burned alive instead    if i sound bitter  it s because i just spent over two hours watching this movie and  uh  i didn t enjoy it very much
