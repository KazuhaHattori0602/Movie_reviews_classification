why else would he do this to me   not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies  or even decent movies  i saw lois and clark  i am aware of just how   good  dean cain is   obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick  and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head  i will not call these spoilers as you can t really spoil this movie any more than it already is   to begin with  why is that a fake helicopter  i mean  why   how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried  how hard would it have been to get either an american actor  or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren t american   why are there   occasions when the movie gives us a slug line  we get helipad day and then mess hall day later on  and then that s it  who cares about the timeline  to be honest  who cared about it even when they mentioned it  but i guess that s beside the point   does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens  the answer is no   that dragon sure can walk down that hall over and over and over and over   who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history  it was straight out of scooby doo  oh  the dragon s dead now say  wanna get dinner  sure  but not at some chinese place with dragon in the name  ah ha ha ha  ha ha ha  haha ha  i used to be superman  aha ha ha  ha ha   fade to black  my god  it made me cringe it was so stupid   but never fear even though the whole building exploded and no one was left alive for some reason there s a second untouched  unmanned lab that survived pretty well  so they can make a sequel  hurray for us all
