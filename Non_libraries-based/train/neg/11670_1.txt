i enjoy a good  slow moving drama  christmas in august  chungking express  virgin stripped bare by her bachelors  the way home  springtime in a small town  hana bi  eat drink man woman  dolls  in the mood for love  and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films   just to name a few    unfortunately  there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves  these are what i call ian films    incomprehensible artistic nonsense  tsai ming liang is the king of this subgenre  and vive l amour is his  masterpiece  in fact  this is the cr me de la cr me of crap infested garbage under the guise of  art  people walk around in their apartments  drink water  stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant  hang posters  staple papers together  go to the bathroom  eat  do pushups  have sex  slap at mosquitoes  etc  i m not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film  which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art house trash  there is no plot  no storyline  no interesting or noteworthy events  no emotion  no meaningful dialogue  and most importantly   no drama   the most eventful scene has two people  banging  on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress   ironic that it s also totally tasteless and gratuitous  the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non existent  tsai apparently didn t feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to  bang  the person under the bed is just as one dimensional and uninteresting  he likes to drink water  makeout with melons  and stroke himself  this is tsai s idea of  character development  a truly misguided  entertainer  indeed   tsai s true contribution in vive l amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art house film history  he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for   consecutive seconds  only to then show her cry hysterically   for absolutely no reason whatsoever   for another   consecutive seconds  the film then abruptly ends  no point  no entertainment  just pure  concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer    in an effort to beat a dead horse  the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom  in fact  kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo  and guess what  it s actually interesting  that film moved as slow as molasses in january  but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l amour  kairo is a perfect example of that   fans of cinema may thank tsai ming liang for directing this film  as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art house cinema can be just as poorly made as b grade  made for television horror flicks  art house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self righteousness  the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and   gasp    showgirls  how do you like them apples
