you can tell a lew grade production a mile off   distinctly british in style  epic in conception  peopled by international all star casts  usually set in exotic climes  it s a formula that grade and his company itc employed throughout the  s into the early  s  resulting in titles like the eagle has landed  firepower  and raise the titanic  in   grade produced march or die  a remarkably old fashioned foreign legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above  directed by the usually dependable dick richards   who helmed the acclaimed farewell my lovely just a couple years earlier   march or die is an unfortunate disappointment   a company of foreign legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian general foster  gene hackman  is sent to morocco shortly after world war   their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated francois marneau  max von sydow  the archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of erfoud  but fear an attack from arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group  foster is not happy with the assignment   he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives  this creates ongoing tension between himself and marneau  who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible  the problems heighten when a beautiful woman named simone picard  catherine deneuve  tags along with the legionnaires  she is hoping to find out what happened to her father  a historian abducted by the arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team  her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires  none more so than gypsy thief marco segrain  terence hill  a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature  things climax with a huge battle at erfoud  with swarms of united arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives   on paper the star duo of gene hackman and terence hill seem a mismatch   hackman is the heavyweight oscar winning character actor  hill the handsome but limited italian heart throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns  one expects hackman to act his counterpart off the screen  yet  bizarrely  it is hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance  while hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels  the film is attractively shot on desert locations  but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for  maurice jarre s music is uncommonly flat too   very disappointing from the guy who gave us the lawrence of arabia score  it is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old fashioned adventure of this type in the  s  it was a genre that peaked in the  s  and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades  sadly  the gamble doesn t really pay off   this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march
