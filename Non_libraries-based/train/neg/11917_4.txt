genghis cohn is a  very  mildly entertaining british movie about a german police commissioner in the late  s who is haunted by the ghost of a jewish comedian that he killed   years earlier while serving under hitler in the ss  the ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a jew to atone for the murders he committed   otto  the german policeman actually knows this ghost s name because  the last thing he did before he died was said  in yiddish  `kiss my ass  the policeman didn t speak yiddish  so he asked around until he found the meaning  the `kiss my ass  left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian s name  genghis cohn   there are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner  and there are no helpful clues  the men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher  the butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich  so the commissioner is a suspect  the first man is killed while making love to the butcher s wife  so the butcher is a suspect  but the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife  all the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking   i think i might be a bit angrier than the ghost of genghis cohn if i was killed like he was  he seems to be very good natured about it  as if he was just in a mild car accident  i can only guess that it is because it is a british movie and they are known for being a very polite people  he uses some of his material from his stand up routing  and i just didn t find it very funny   i gave this movie a   because it was just kind of goofy  i thought it should have been a little more serious than it was  the movie turns out to be a murder mystery  where did this come from  and it seemed that genghis should have been more helpful than he was  the movie gave me a tiny look into jewish culture  but was only skin deep  do all jews love liver and onion sandwiches  do they all say `shtoop  and `meshuganah  in their daily vocabulary  isn t there more important stuff that we should know about the culture   i saw this movie at a jewish community center in berkeley  ca  and i was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white   i have no gray or white hair  there were   of us  and after the movie they stayed for about   minutes to discuss the movie  there were   main concerns expressed there    the movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and   as the holocaust survivors are dying off  future generations will not know what really happened  i thought that this second concern was ridiculous and i told them i thought they didn t need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies  like myself  the murder of   people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten  i write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day
