this movie has a very broadway feel   the backdrop  the acting  the  noise  and yet that s all it has  some  sense  of a broadway without the bang    the movie is slow paced  the picture disjointed  the singing  pops up  on you so that you suddenly are reminded it s a musical    disappointing  sinatra   intolerable  sinatra s fianc surely  the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary    tolerable  mr  i remember the numbers on my dice    delight  brando s understated singing  very biased   surprise  how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes  it s the bone structure  how i would ve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again
