if you really  truly want to waste two hours of your life  do the following      look through the tv listings    find the movie  men in white    when  men in white  comes on  sit and watch   and that s it  after sitting through two hours of bad puns  dreadful  and not that funny  movie references  and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history  you will have wasted two hours of your life  and wonder exactly why   why did i do this  i was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good  it wasn t   but  on the other hand  if you re old enough to remember power rangers  you might spot some familiar faces during the film  presumably to save on production costs  saban  who also make power rangers  decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone s favourite tacky toy spawning franchise throughout the film  i spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes i saw from when i was a kid  so i guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value   but  if you want to see actual power rangers monsters  go watch power rangers itself  it s much better than this piece of garbage   and that s saying something
