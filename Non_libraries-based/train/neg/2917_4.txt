as it is often the case  the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories  similar to unleashed  which was great  dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master s bidding  the main characters  an emotionally undeveloped  amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer  are far from the common heroes and villains we often see  in fact  by the end  you lose track of who you re supposed to empathize with  failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men   whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide   although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability  by the half way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge  the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling  and in the end  you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary   on the plus side  the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies   so those who aren t familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood s predictability should check it out   the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film  it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten  maybe i m the only one  but it strained my eyes   the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you   an interesting build up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget  low speed chase scene  and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy  you realize that it s not an ending at all  but rather a transition into a wacky country music montage about peace and serenity   throw in some grisly from behind choke scenes  a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way  asians  fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn t match the film  and you get the average bland asian thriller   i just don t get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions 
i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs  ultimately  in the end  we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us   tetanus
