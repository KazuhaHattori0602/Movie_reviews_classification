 this review may have spoilers   but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well known story   the cinderella story ranks as my favorite fairy tale  the world will never have enough of this wonderful tale   the problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale  this cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing   this cinderella story is more like an ugly duckling that never hatches or rather  is never transformed into a swan   all the production value that money can buy  cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development   or good acting   the entrance of cinderella at the ball as so poorly done  there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery   the writing made me very nervous  too  the prince charming was the most undesirable of memory  why would any girl want to marry a boorish  self absorbed prince who disliked women    turner s turn on the stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one liners more than acting nuance   even the cinderella part held little interest or sympathy   perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt  so cheaply  s   what must be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography  matte work and production design  it was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes  sets and settings as the story unfolded   for some cinderella storytelling  go for two gems     rodgers and hammerstein s cinderella musical with lesley ann warren  even with the obvious stagey tv    s look to the sets  this is the best version on celluloid   bar none  an all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment  engaging  diverting and memorable writing and music  this is the classic     ever after  this drew barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective  alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale  the characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well
