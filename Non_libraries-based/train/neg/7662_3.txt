 pletely  watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn t much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn  i mean this isn t just bad  it is laughably bad  oh  and for those of you curious  she doesn t get naked  only down to a bra in a silly  totally unnecessary love scene   even with reid s performance  perhaps the movie could have worked  but the plot is what dominates  and the plot seems written by a   year old  i hadn t realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd  otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real time    the storyline jumps back and forth from slater s childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened  he has amnesia  of course  in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit   a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something  slater had to leave because he was too rebellious  i guess  you never really know unless it was in one of those voice overs i zoned out during  the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts  obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a  chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities  i may have the exact quote wrong  but you get the idea   there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth  no reason given  experiments on children  super demon alien human hybrids   photonic  bullets  the demon things can t stand sunlight  and  of course  slater and dorf to try to save everyone   jesus  i can t even being to wade through the clich d elements  the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth  i mean  why is this evil scientist so damn evil  oh right  humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race  i guess he s infected  how did that happen  oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself  how the hell did that happen  why and where did he get the super slugs  oh yes  they use the old sci fi stand by of parasitic aliens demons which  fuse  with the spine of their host of course  slater is  like blade  half super slug powered  but his slug  didn t fully fuse due to an electrical shock  thank god  oh  and the people with these  fused  spines  have no idea they re half alien demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies  yeah we get zombies   so lots of crap that could be entertaining  but none of it is   also  the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place at least nothing a little dynamite can t handle   not the very worst thing you ll see  but a truly bad movie
