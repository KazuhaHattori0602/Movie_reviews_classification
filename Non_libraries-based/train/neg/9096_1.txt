i think this is probably one of the worst movies i ve watched in a long time   trying to get the  same characters  with different people is  such  a bad idea  if they couldn t get sara michelle g  and ryan p  in this one  they should have just cut their losses and said to heck with it  instead they get new actors that are horrible at what they did  i seriously felt like i was at a high school or  bad  college play with the lever of acting these people put forth   where do they get some of these people  was this their first movie  it sure seemed like it   this movie also parallels the original in a few lines of speech  i had just got done watching the first one and popped   in  i was all excited to get to watch the second one and it ended up being the worst show i ve seen in a while  i don t hardly ever  ever  turn off a movie  but this one definitely went off after about       min
