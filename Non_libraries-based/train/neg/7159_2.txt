i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as  the return of the texas chainsaw massacre  but this film compete with it   i m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie  but i did it   minutes after the trance started  i woke up  and started to watching it agian  why did i deserve that  all the movie was a torture  i have to use fast forward to watch it complete   i can t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time  mr  walken  could done this thing  i have to think that he made the director a favor  or he was really in the need of money  because film after film he is doing  he is ruining himself  and so fast   what about the movie  it s not scary  stupid plot  characters are awful  but i really liked the one played by jared harris  effects are very poor  lack of deaths   blood  etc  in three words  it has anything  and i mean it  can t stand how a director can make a film like this   anyway  when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover  that the film was presented by  stephen king  i think he could never present this crap  no   i rented it in argentina  i not recommend it in a million years   i rate this movie with a   out of    as i say in my  return of the texas chainsaw massacre  review  there will be always a worse movies  thats why it don t deserves a   out of
