i wish spike lee had chosen a different title for his film   summer of sam  conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer  david berkowitz  it s not  it s a gritty  earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of   when berkowitz terrorized that city   the film follows several young fictional characters in an italian american neighborhood  and their reactions to the son of sam threat  there s vinny and his wife dionna  there s richie and ruby  and several other characters   the problem is that these characters are not likable  they are routinely annoying  and at times unbearable  lee then belabors their high energy  chaotic lives  which are filled with anger  lust  and general turmoil  there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife  redundant disco dance scenes  countless gabfests   over and over i kept wondering  where s the film editor   meanwhile  with all that bulk  the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace  which is too much in the background  lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace  that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups   the acting is uniformly good  that  combined with  s disco music  and lavish attention to costumes and production design  make you really feel like you are in an italian american neighborhood in nyc in    the film s atmospheric authenticity  however  is not nearly enough to offset a rambling  overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people
