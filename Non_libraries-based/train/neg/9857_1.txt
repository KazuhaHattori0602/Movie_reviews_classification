i just finished watching this movie and i found it was basically just not funny at all   i m an rpg gamer  computer type  none of the dnd tabletop stuff  but i found none of the jokes in this funny at all   some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot  tilt and zoom could ve been cut down to  seconds rather than over a minute  and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time   i think i laughed a total of   times in the entire movie   the acting itself wasn t all that bad  around the standard that a b grade movie should have   i d suggest not bothering with this movie unless you re a huge dnd fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it
