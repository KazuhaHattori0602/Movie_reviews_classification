this is a truly awful film  what they have done is taken a tv show  which was never aimed at young children   given it the george lucas treatment  i e  ruined it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience   ok so the thunderbirds tv show wasn t exactly the most cerebral of shows  in fact it was pretty formulaic  but it was always enjoyable to watch  especially when the models got blown up  and the voice cast wasn t too bad   this suffers from bad casting   bad acting  with the notable exceptions of sophia myles as lady penelope   ron cook as parker  who seem to be the only cast members to have a clue about how their characters should be played    after this travesty i wouldn t let frakes direct traffic   the whole point of thunderbirds was that it was about the whole tracy family   how they worked as a team  preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in disasters   avoid this rubbish like the plague   i only give it   out of   because a zero rating is not supported
