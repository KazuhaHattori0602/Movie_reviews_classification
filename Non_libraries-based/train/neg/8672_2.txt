most action films are crass of hindi cinema  especially of sunny and his family   the film is typical sunny type with bashes  big dialogues and melodrama  the film also has typical rajiv rai ingredients of many henchmen and a weird villain  the starting is okay and then the shift to kenya is good but then the film goes on and on   the sequence of events move at a slow pace and nothing that great happens  they are many stupid scenes like the kenya policemen are shown like jokers especially sharat  the climax too is prolonged  rajiv rai does an okay job music is okay  only   song works and that is the last toofan camera work is good  sunny deol is as usual  chunky acts like a monkey while his serious scenes are laughable  naseer is alright heroines are pure wood amrish puri is not even half as scary as he was in tridev the rest are okay
