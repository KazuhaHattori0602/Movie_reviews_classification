i sat through this movie this evening  forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them  because the two leads  g rard philippe and mich le morgan  were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in  something different  which this certainly was  they both gave fine performances  but of distasteful characters   indeed  the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters  the doctor is  of course  the major exception  what mich le morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explained   this is supposedly based on a work by jean paul sartre  all i could think was that  if sartre s work is anything like this movie  it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus  masterful novel the plague  which dealt with a plague in north africa   a well acted but uninteresting movie
