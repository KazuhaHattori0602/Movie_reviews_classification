anyone notice that tommy only has   facial expressions     the angry eyes look he gives every enemy    the holding of the hands to face  mouth agape and frightened eyes    the smiling tommy turnbull   i have to say that i pretty much hate this show  i don t watch it but it s like code lyoko  we ve all watched at least one  i must say that this show is borderline racist  uninteresting and pointless   every episode ends with robotboy winning  except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack   the jokes are pretty crude too  i think it s mostly people saying the word  suck  or farting  i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too   isn t there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate  and the other uses a chain  for god sake  what kind of school is he going to  not to mention his older brother  who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities   the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters  like you could say the trio of coop  jamie and kiva  as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he s free spirited despite being a robot   there is simply no appeal to this show  i m surprised that it s still running
