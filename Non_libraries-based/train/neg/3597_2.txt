well  there you have it  another disillusion on my account  two  actually  first of all  even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about  s euro exploitation and its most prolific contributors  i never heard about joseph w  sarno before  here s a guy who made over seventy rancid and cult laden exploitation movies and i haven t seen a single one  how  why  what happened here  secondly  and even worse  just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies  that director s most famous and supposed  masterpiece  turns out to be an irredeemably dull and irritating film  admittedly  lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole  but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious sensuality  like jos  larraz   vampyres  or harry k mmel s  daughters of darkness  joseph sarno s film has nothing to offer  except copious amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly  the events take place in a secluded old castle  hidden deep in the german mountains  where five centuries ago lived a malicious and bloodthirsty  literally  baroness  her loyal disciples still throw naked dance parties in the castle s catacombs  which are lit by penis shaped candles
auch  and hope to resurrect the baroness any time soon now  suddenly  don t even ask how  the castle is full of young and sexy female guests  so even more erotic rites ensue  sounds delicious and entertaining enough  but  the devil s plaything  contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast members  ignorant facial expressions are simply unendurable  sarno isn t capable of creating suspense or building a gothic atmosphere  or maybe he just didn t bother to  and the actresses  capacities restrict themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face  please do yourself a favor  no matter how desperately you strive to see all lurid lesbian vampire movies of the  s  this one isn t worth a penny  even the repertoires of jess franco and jean rollin are pure art compared to this dud
