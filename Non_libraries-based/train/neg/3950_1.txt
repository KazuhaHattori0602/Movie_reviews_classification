i was previously unaware that in the early  s devry university  or was it itt tech  added film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs  well this movie must have been the product of the class valedictorian  my friend and i rented the original   boogeyman on my netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the dvd  do not waste your time with this movie  awful awful awful    the filmmaker adds   main character s  a woman and her therapist  the woman has been having dreams about the boogeyman and his victim s from the first film  over   of this film is stock from the original movie  the rest of the movie is the main character having the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a the narrator  these scenes are shot through a filter so thick the characters glow  they would make angela lansbury look   years old  so  to recap  awful  don t watch this movie
