once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results  the title is false as is everything about this film  the period is not persuasively rendered  and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals  arthur penn s film had style  humor  a point of view  and was made by talented people  even if the   version didn t exist this would still be an unnecessary film  the   version strayed from the facts  presented a glamorized version of bonnie and clyde  but it was exciting  and innovative for   and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care  this   remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow  unappealing  and not the least bit interesting  by all means skip this one and hope the   version will be better  could it possibly be worse
