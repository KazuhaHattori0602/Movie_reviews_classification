this film is so incredibly bad  that i almost felt sick watching it  up until this point  the other installments had at least one good thing about it  part   was suspenseful and gory  part   was off beat and entertaining  part   was interesting with great effects  part   had great music  good special effects  and a new entertaining freddy krueger  part   is more boring than anything i ve ever seen before  alice  a much prettier blond  from part   is back with her boyfriend dan  at parts  this supposed elm street installment turns into a daytime soap  the newer characters seem harsh  and even that sweet alice has a chip on her shoulder  freddy seems to be completely out of this one  he looks tired  and doesn t seem to be as gruesome  his one liners seem out of place and different  where as in part   they could be pretty funny  leslie bohem s story never gets off the ground and stephen hopkins  direction is so bad  that it makes my grandmother look good  the whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic  it s also confusing and pretty stupid  avoid part   at all costs
