like wearing a hair shirt  positively  absolutely  without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst movies ever  pure torture  zero stars out of ten  one long  tedious  labored  pretentious  self conscious  theatrical  and leadenly artsy scene after another  intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic  the soul bared  it is  instead  morose mush    half naked  father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers   homo erotic  is the point  loud and clear  ok  so what    repeated more than once by the son is the line  supposedly lifted from  lives of the saints   a father s love crucifies  a loving son lets himself be crucified  the parallel to god and his son  christ  is heavy handed  irrelevant  and bombastic  like everything else here    some reference points to the theme of russian filiality   mother and son     the return   andrei zvyagvatsev     little odessa   james gray  turgenev   fathers and sons  and  of course  dostoyevsky   the brothers karamazov   credits in english indicate intended international distribution  meaning that the excuse cannot be used that you have to be russian to understand this mess    this is nowhere near as accomplished or compelling as sokurov s last   russian ark     as in his  mother and son  an equally powerful soporific  some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors  though not as interestingly  the film is almost monochromatic  shot from start to finish through beige filters  making it as visually as it is dramatically numbing  a soft focus haze only adds to the drugged feeling   an annoying soundtrack drones on  never shuts up  like a tape loop  an old radio constantly plays in the background  russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as  themes based on tchaikovsky  the presence of a  sound designer   sergei moshkov  signifies  of course  that all those irritating little sounds  radio static  noises  distortion  and such  are  designed    it s hard to believe someone  sergei potepolov  actually wrote this thing  it all seems as arbitrary as traffic  as if improvised by bored actors  popping out of nothingness into nothingness   modern art has finally succeeded in signifying the thing without being the thing  so that what we behold is the idea of the idea  empty as a shell  but not even a shell  merely the idea of a shell  could one ask for a better definition of decadence
