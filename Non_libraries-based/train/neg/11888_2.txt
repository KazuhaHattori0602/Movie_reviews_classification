to make any film about the supposed end of the world  there should be some facts   realism   we are never told why these people believe this   location is new years eve in toronto canada   so please some one tell me why was then still shining at midnight   why based on the costumes  did it seem like september    the acting was in that neo au natural style  that needed a director who knew how to do it     the individual story pieces were all dreary   without any purpose  i could go on  but i do not want to make this as boring as the film    rating    out of     on imdb scale  thank you i am as always   jay harris  aka sirbossman
