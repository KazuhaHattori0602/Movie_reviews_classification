given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness   minutes   including end credits  so roughly   minutes of actual film  but what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed   the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny  the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the nike basketball spots  james woods  portrayal of max van sydow s character in the exorcist  and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film  very unfunny was the take off of charlie s angels  which like the first scary movie and the matrix spin off scene  basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it   today s youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the  s such as the exorcist and maybe of the  s  poltergeist  et  al   hopefully scary movie   will take some time to put together  making the spoofs more enjoyable   one thing though  the film features more than the last one of promising young actress anna faris  whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel  just for her casting and acting ability  i give this movie a   out of
