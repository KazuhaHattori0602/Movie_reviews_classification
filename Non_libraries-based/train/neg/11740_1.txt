positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar   while sanders was an excellent character actor  he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it   it is absolutely beyond stupidity  gene lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting   sadly  george sanders and co star carol landis committed suicide in real life  after making a film as deplorable as this  it is not shocking   the usual appealing signe hasso is really nothing here
