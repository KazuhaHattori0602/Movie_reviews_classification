cheap and manipulative  this film has no heart   it s also got dire dialogue  unconvincing characters and a preposterous  or rather non existent  story  it just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion afest   and the hedgehog how many cheap shots can a film take  the hedgehog  by the way  gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety minute cringe athon   if you have considered watching this film  don t  i m sorry but i cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie  it scores a big  fat zero with me  strictly for sub dogma knicker wetters  yawneroony   still  if you liked dancing in the dark
