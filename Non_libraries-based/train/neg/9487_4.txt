the cast although nothing special  all do an ok job  the story seems like a good idea  the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist  so what s wrong with it   for a start the special effects are really bad  if this was made in the  s  it might look ok but in   there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this  it makes me laugh that the dvd cover claims very proudly  from the special effects creator of jeepers creepers   secondly the direction is weak  this film just does not capture the essence of the story  a doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the devil  or demon type creature  should be tense or frightening  it simply isn t   all in all this is a pretty poor film  and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining  it is still probably best left alone   a rather sad
