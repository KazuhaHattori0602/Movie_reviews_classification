the secret is this movie blows  sorry  but it just did     spoiler   in this bad riff on i know what you did last summer and scream  beth  played admirably by dorie barton  joins several friends on a spring break trip  the group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation  then  the deaths begin  first one then another then another of the friends is murdered  leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results    one note  dorie barton is the poor man s reese witherspoon she looks like reese  acts like reese and could pass for reese in a police lineup  maybe that s how they cast her  anyhoo  decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
