antonioni  by making this film  had assumed the role of papa smurf to all the little long haired  american  radical student smurfs  he had taken them under the guiding protection of his european communist wings  showing appreciation and support for their confused american ways   these smurfs are red and wear blue  not the other way around  the radical smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the god of all long haired smurfs  lenin the communist   another wise old man whose beard made the smurfs take him even more seriously  for it symbolized something wise  though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them  castro  another wise bearded man  has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers   not to mention che guevara  that beard has a certain je ne sais pas quoi about it  makes one want to immediately embrace marx and his lovely  pacifistic teachings
  the film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students  who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word  confused  as confused as a blind folded dog falling of a high story building into a bottomless pit  suddenly  the movie s  hero   well  antonioni s hero  rises up and says something to his pathetic left wing peers and then leaves  hoping that this display of  mega coolness  will improve his james dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best  chicks  in the next mass hippie orgy  eventually he gets into trouble with cops  i e  pigs  at a rally  and spends the movie under the blue american capitalist skies  looking for freedom
 or something like that   antonioni s predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow  but has  or had  nothing new to offer  it s just the same old trigger happy one dimensional cops  businessmen discussing business deals  and what s wrong with that  isn t that how antonioni s movies get made  and endless shots of tv commercials and billboards advertising the oh so morally decadent products for the abhorrent  selfish  and greedy right wing rabble population who thinks of no one but themselves  their families  their work  and their children   papa smurf antonioni  just like his long haired smurfs and smurfettes of the late  s  failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement  they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their anti establishment opinions freely within that very establishment  whereas the students in those countries whose left wing systems they admired  did not  and still do not  by far the greatest irony about the hippies   and antonioni  naturally  failed to realize this as well  his judgment being clouded by cocaine snorting and an excessive intake of lsd    is that hippies were  are  the garbage residue of capitalism  this is an incredible irony  only in a successfully functioning capitalist system can you find that species called  hippie  a spoiled  ungrateful  and selfish bunch of middle and upper middle class losers   the film itself seems to go on forever  antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it  while including overlong scenes of pointlessness  with a high dullness factor  his attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite  his statements are highly dubious  at best  this film is antonioni s way of saying that violent revolution is the solution  and this is what we get from an old  saturated  filthy rich  fat film maker who lives in villas and dines in the best french and italian restaurants   i don t remember seeing any major western movie about the tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in china  but when one western student gets shot for waving che guevara s face into all our faces  we get ten major films about it at once  i suppose this means that a chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a western one   at least to the left wing hypocrites who infest movies   if you re a marxist neo hippy and disliked this awful review  please klick  no  below
