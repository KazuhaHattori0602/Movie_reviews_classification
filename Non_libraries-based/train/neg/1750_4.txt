priyadarshan s hera pheri was a nice situational comedy this film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical  in fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it isn t anything great  the first half has   funny scenes like the one where akshay and john invite neha for a lunch and another when paresh enters  the first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script   the jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person s voices from inside the rooms   the climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it s quite funny but the film ends abruptly  direction is okay music is good  akshay kumar excels in his part which is now become his second skin  but this is his film completely and he overshadows everyone else  john stumbles throughout and fails in comedy paresh rawal is hilarious rajpal is okay the girls are loud at times and awkward too nargis  daisy and neetu only neetu is seen now  are good in parts but shriek too often manoj joshi is okay
