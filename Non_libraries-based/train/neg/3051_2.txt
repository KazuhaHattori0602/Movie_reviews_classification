this was another obscure christmas related title  a low budget mexican production from exploitation film maker cardona  night of the bloody apes [ ]  tintorera  [ ]  which   like many a genre effort from this country   was acquired for release in the u s  by k  gordon murray  judging by those two efforts already mentioned  cardona was no visionary   and  this one having already received its share of flak over here  is certainly no better  the film  in fact  is quite redolent of the weirdness which characterized mexican horror outings from the era  but given an added dimension by virtue of the garish color  which  in view of the prominence of reds   apart from st  nick himself  the devil plays a major role in the proceedings   throughout  was essential  anyway  in a nutshell  the plot involves satan s efforts to stall santa claus  christmas eve rendezvous with the earth s children  there is  however  plenty more wackiness along the way  to begin with  our portly  white bearded and chronically merry man in red lives in a celestial palace who  apart from accompanying toy maker kids from all over the world on his piano as they sing  laboriously for the whole first reel  in their native tongue  visits merlin   the famed magician at king arthur s court  here bafflingly but amusingly prone to child like hopping and mumbling gibberish    once every year to acquire potions which would bring somnolence to the young and render himself invisible  by the way  the wizard s anachronistic presence here is no less unlikely than his being a cohort of dr  frankenstein in son of dracula [ ]  incidentally  by this time  he always seems to have gained some excess weight
so santa has to work out in order to be able to fit into each proverbial chimney  the devil s antics  enthusiastically rubbing his hands together at every turn and generally hamming it up  to hold up st  nick s delivery program  then  is perfectly puerile  indeed  their tit for tat shenanigans resemble an old laurel   hardy routine more than anything  to pad out the running time  we focus on three sets of children  one  the lonely son of a rich couple who wants nothing more for christmas than their company  projected as a wish fulfillment fantasy where the boy finds his parents wrapped in extra large packages  a girl from a poor family who yearns to own a doll of her own  the horned one first tempts her to steal one  then invades the little one s dreams   to no avail  and a trio of brats who  egged on once again by satan  think of nothing but causing mischief and eventually fall out amongst themselves  there is definitely imagination at work here  but it is applied with little rhyme or reason  while the overall juvenile approach keeps entertainment  unless one counts the film as a guilty pleasure  well at bay
