  and i actually gave it a zero on my personal   scale  i have been attending movies since   and have seen well over   in the theater  i don t rate movies that i see only on tv  this is the only movie i have ever rated zero   my wife and i took our four children  then aged       and   and even the kids thought it was terrible  in fact  it was my daughter  now   who alerted me to this site  amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of    the animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time  and is even worse in retrospect  the acting  particularly by sean young  is atrocious and the story line is simply silly
