this one is just like the  th movie  the movie is really bad  it offers nothing in the death department  the one liners are bad and are something that shouldn t be in a noes movie  freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie  lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while  the characters are extremely underdeveloped  all in all better than the  th one  but still one the worst movies of the series  my rating
