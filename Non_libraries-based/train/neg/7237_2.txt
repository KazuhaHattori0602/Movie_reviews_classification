life is really too short for movies like this  i knew it couldn t be good when i realized what i d already suspected   that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in  friends   let s face it  either the guy can t play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts  i have a feeling that it s a mixture of both   and i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow  barbara hershey  toni collette and carol kane
