 igor and the lunatics  is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie  apparently even nearly twenty years later  charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash filmmakers  this is a typical troma production  meaning in other words  there s a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot  there s a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display   which isn t bad   but it s all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at   igor and the lunatics  is so desperate that it s even using a lot of the footage twice  like the circle saw killing for example  the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul  one of paul s lower ranked disciples  named igor  becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity  just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is  he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch hiker girl  there s an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks  like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences  maybe there s one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that  is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete  for no particular reason  the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds
