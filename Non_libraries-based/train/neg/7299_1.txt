sure i ve seen bad movies in my life  but this one was so bad that i actually became angry in the theater  i wanted my money back  i wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket  of course i didn t receive a refund  or even a reply  but it s the point that matters  on a scale of   i give this movie a   why did the  jeep   chevy blazer  stop running from being hit with a bat  why did they hit the  jeep chevy blazer  with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum s skull  the plot was thin  the movie filled with obvious clich s  and certain parts of it just didn t make any sense
