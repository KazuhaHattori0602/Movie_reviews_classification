if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a   hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability  you ll love this film  otherwise  you ll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget   in the previews for the film  many scenes were shown which were not in the film  and within the film  some scenes just don t make sense  while the movie is slightly less than   hour and a half  i can only think of one truly memorable moment  and that is just before or during the credits
