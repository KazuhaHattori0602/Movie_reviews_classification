just think  it cost a total of   to make  clerks  how the hell did they spend   million to make this glorified music video  a practically unknown cast  two or three sets  no special effects that i could see  i know  it must have been spent on that expertly crafted  economical  tension filled screenplay  shoot  that bar set must have cost a bundle  anyway  i guess jerry bruckheimer wouldn t be caught dead producing anything for less  i m just surprised he didn t blow up anything   anyway  it wasn t an awful film i guess  the female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok  imo it just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for   million without any loss to the production  and   more   million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well
