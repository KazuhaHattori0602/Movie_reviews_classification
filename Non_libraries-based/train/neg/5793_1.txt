it really was that bad  on a par with the  mercifully  short lived  dirty dozen  tv series that starred ben murphy and was made at around the same time  also on the cheap in yugoslavia   i was embarrassed for the cast members of this film   and for telly savalas in particular  he was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role  pushing   when he made this garbage  and the reviewer who draws parallels with telly the greek in this and john wayne in  the green berets  pretty much sums it up   other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains  so i won t repeat them here  but i will add that i m amazed that no one s yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny looking helmet that savalas wears on his big  bloated head    i m also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as   here at imdb   as far as i m concerned  it s a   right across the board  if you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea  especially  plus years after the original    look no further than  the dirty dozen   the fatal mission   awful   avoid
