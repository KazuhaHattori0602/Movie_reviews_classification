  possible mild spoiler    as i watched the first half of guilty as sin i couldn`t believe it was made in   because it played like a jagged edge   joe eszterhas clone from the mid  s   it starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse   is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney       but halfway through the film shows its early  s credentials by turning into a   lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client   type film which ends in a ridiculous manner   and guilty as sin has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect    this is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by sidney lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama   angry men
