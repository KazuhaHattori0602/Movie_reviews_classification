connie hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times   that s it  folks  the sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not   these  s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness  flared trousers  big hair  zapata moustaches etc  this one isn t   the script is bad  the acting is bad  the direction is bad  and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad   the title  hinting at a sex comedy  is grossly misleading   i heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague
