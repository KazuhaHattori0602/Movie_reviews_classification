well  where to begin  let s just say this  avoid this movie at all  costs  it s based on a cartoon series  the movie makes the cartoon look  like hamlet  filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be  here  lousy camera work  terrible music  and enough product placement to  make you want to never visit yahoo  again  this movie is really the  bottom of the barrel  to quote the new yorker  matthew broderick and  rupert everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandon  of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance   they should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it   awful
