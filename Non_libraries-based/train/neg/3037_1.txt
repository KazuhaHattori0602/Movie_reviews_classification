its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies  and i do not see where all this  its not that bad  rubbish is coming from  the acting is terrible  it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other  dancing  movies out there  its terrible  the name should scream don t watch   how she move  since when can movie titles ignore grammar  at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes  these ones don t even deserve a watch  i give it a   out of   just because there is no zero  i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over   not to watch this  and not to waste your money  the   should tell it all  this movie should not have even be made
