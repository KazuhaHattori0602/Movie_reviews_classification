first of all  the reason i m giving this film   stars instead of   is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo  he alone can get   stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie   i was initially all fired up at reading one poster s comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave  the performance of his career  to me  it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie  and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment  then i thought to myself  what else has stevens done  so i checked and  you know  that person was absolutely right  in the   years since this columbo movie was made  apparently every one of the   projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap  so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career   if you like columbo  see every other of the   titles before watching this one  do yourself a favor and save the worst for last
