i saw this movie when it was released  and my distaste for it has stuck with me all these years    here s why    greenaway s goal seems to be to take every literary image in the tempest and make it literal  if a character were to say   my heart takes flight  we d be shown an actual human heart  with pigeon wings attached  flapping across the screen    this process makes for some lush tableaux  but ultimately it s a facile exercise  and it becomes deadly boring   i don t begrudge the pleasure other viewers found in this movie  but it s worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured
