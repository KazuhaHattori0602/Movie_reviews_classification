there is a dvd published in the uk in   code hrgd  on the cover  no asin  vfc   on the disk  no ifpi code in the inner rim   probably a straight transfer from vhs    there is no much point is commenting an adult film  but this one contains a minimal plot  and the characters are believable  it was shown in the united states in normal cinemas   i ve seen it in pensylvannia way back in    as such it deserves a place in an encyclopedia of movies  the dvd has no special features and no subtitles  and was probably made using a vhs tape as source
