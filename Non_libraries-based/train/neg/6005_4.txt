this is a classic stinker with a big named cast  mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one   this is quite a depressing film when you think about it  remain on earth  and you will face illness and eventually your demise   gwen verndon showed that she could still dance  too bad the movie didn t concentrate more on that  maureen stapleton  looking haggard  still displayed those steps from  queen of the star dust ballroom  so much more down to earth from   years earlier   i only hope that this film doesn t encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones  how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think   why did don ameche win an oscar for this nonsense   if the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end  why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat  why did steve guttenberg jump ship as well  after all  he had found his lady love    this would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there   sadly  with the exception of wilford brimley  at this writing  vernon  gilford  stapleton  ameche  tandy  cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone  the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
