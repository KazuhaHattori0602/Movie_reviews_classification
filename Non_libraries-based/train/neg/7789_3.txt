while not exactly offensive  the   version of  the perils of pauline  is certainly moronic  the title might lead you to expect a tribute to pearl white  the original pauline in the   silent   episode serial  but for that you would be better served by the   version starring betty hutton  this   version is like a mix of  casino royale  and the weakest of the elvis movies  worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotch taped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles    what unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of pamela austin  pauline  and pat boone  george steadman  a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills  imagine mandy moore playing opposite dan quayle    austin would later play opposite john aston in  evil roy slade  with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch  in the mid s she was the  dodge rebellion  girl  as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations imagine sandra dee in a dark blue jumpsuit  when the automaker s ad agency replaced her with the  dodge fever  girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film    what story there is here begins with pauline growing up in the baskerville foundling home run by the actress who played mrs  chatsworth osborne sr  on  dobie gillis  george falls in love with her  pauline not mrs osborne  and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted  george leaves to seek his fortune and   year old pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich middle eastern prince  when he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril  these include african pygmies  a   year old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year old grandson is old enough for marriage  the movie industry  and the russian space program   all this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part  there is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under  cranking of a camera  which speeds up the action  unfortunately everything else  film stock  production design  editing  is depressingly  s  nothing here even approaches the images of pearl white strapped to a log moving toward a buzz saw or tied to railway track waiting for the approaching train   then again  what do i know  i m only a child
