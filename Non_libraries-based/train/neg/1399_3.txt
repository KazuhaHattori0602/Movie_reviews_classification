ouch  what a painfully boring sci fi movie  and that s especially saddening because the opening   minutes were so action packed and full of potential  during the intro  we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top secret files  as he s about to reveal the supposedly horrible   inhuman events that take place in the lab  he s executed  figures
 from then on  the  action  swifts back and forth between two locations  the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator  or something  and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing  more like dull  pointless and vague  scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it s really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds  anyway  they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed  yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity threatening device  perhaps i missed something  but i doubt it  the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow  as really none of them have personalities  so basically   the brain machine  just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room  the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren t for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings  the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five second shot of the places  either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves  staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying  i assure you  james best s performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent  but one man definitely can t save this thing from being an absolute waste of time  avoid
