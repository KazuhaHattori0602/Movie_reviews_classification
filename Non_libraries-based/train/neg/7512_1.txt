i had to walk out of the theater  after an hour  all i was seeing was people cheating on wives  schtupping like dogs in a rut  and using the f word like a diabetic using equal   no thanks   it was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot  any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate  talk about it  and swear at each other   the few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development  all that happened was another sex scene  plot development in the  st hour can be summarized as  several murders occur    vinnie sees murder scene   vinnie stares moodily across atlantic east hudson river   vinnie cheats on wife  and   joey  most sympathetic character in the show  gets kicked out of his parents  house  more than that  i didn t wait to see   the photography and the interplay between the characters were superb  but there was nothing for them to do  the flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for something to happen   sorry  spike  take some lessons from notting hill  or shawshank redemption  either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships
