i just didn t get this movie was it a musical  no but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it   was it a serious drama no the acting was not good enough for that   is whoopi goldberg a quality serious actor definently not   i had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie  the message on apartheid and the  tribute  to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted  but as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse   see for yourself  but in fairness i hated it
