a novel by remarque  a cast that looks great on paper  a left wing refugee struggling to remain in paris between the wars  a gestapo officer undercover   it s a pity there s no synergy here  the bits and pieces never coalesce   stories about left wing refugees in france don t have to be this dull  read arthur koestler s memoir  scum of the earth   if you can find it  or his chilling  dialogue with death   ditto   to me  the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details   the leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados  the norman apple brandy  i welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself  it certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly  but  according to the film  it s only sold in cheap  low class saloons  vive le tabac parisien  that s what i say  references to intoxicating liquors do abound here  that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists   i enjoy films set in france because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background  i wasn t disappointed  this time it was for byrrh  a very unusual choice  this film would rate a   if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals   the film s indifferent score is by louis gruenberg  gruenberg is best known   if you can call it that   for his opera  the emperor jones  based on the o neill play  it premi red at roughly the same time as the film version starring paul robeson  the opera survives today in a recording or two by lawrence tibbett  it should surface again soon though  they re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive   opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since charles boyer s character operates under his  czech  aliases  two of them are  wozzeck  and  gunther  both prominent roles in german opera  is that just coincidence   name dropping just seems to be part of this film  notice that they call up  himmelstoss  on the phone  himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in remarque s earlier  all quiet on the western front   well  the in jokes are all in place  guess there wasn t time to develop any drama
