note to all directors  long is not necessarily good  this movie is incredibly long  however not good  the scenes were drawn out way  way  way  way  way too long  the sex scenes were unnecessary  and often too long  the movie edited down to   hours and   minutes or so would have been exceptional  but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a   of   it is way below average   some other problems also exist in this marathon      ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree  the guy who played the great grandfather looks nothing like him  but the grandfather  father and the son  who gives us constant unneeded voice over  are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull headed personality  no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last  even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn  this one is minor  but if the movie hadn t been   weeks long it wouldn t have been so annoying     the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous  some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed  the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave     the love stories in this movie are totally wrong  you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short  suddenly  people are in love and almost instantly  married  then having children  then we draw things out for   centuries and forget about developing relationships  this again would not have stuck out so much in a   hour movie  but with time spent nothing was given to us     the ending was just bad  i don t want to spoil it for anyone  but you won t like it either unless you are sadistic   the director writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis  i mean endless loop  oops they are the same thing    i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie  i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him  long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie  a short description of  the horse whisperer  and sunshine   sunshine  perfect title  if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave
