usually  i don t think hollywood productions are fit to be called film  so i call them  movies  instead  but this piece of elephant manure  is not even fit to be called a movie  hence the quotes in the title   where shall i start    if this isn t the start of geriatric casting  it sure is the epitome of it  stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age  she s supposed to play an   year old  and she is forty effing two      a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france  where we see clich  characters such as  the sympathetic grumpy shop owner  the bitchy queen of models  the fairy god mother ex queen of models  etc  this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code   which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy      it s highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place  especially if the whole focus is about that    the horrible accents      the nana mouskouri elevator music   i could go on  but i think this is enough  and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour  while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations   i mean    i invite everyone to add to my list     p  d
