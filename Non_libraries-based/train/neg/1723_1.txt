man  what a scam this turned out to be  not because it wasn t any good  as i wasn t really expecting anything from it  but because i was misled by the dvd sleeve which ignorantly paraded its  stars  as being stuart whitman  stella stevens and tony bill  sure enough  their names did not appear in the film s opening credits  much less themselves in the rest of it  as it turned out  the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure las vegas lady     but what that one has to do with the crater lake monster is anybody s guess
   even so  since i paid   for its rental and i was in a monster movie mood anyhow  i elected to watch the movie regardless and  yup  it stunk  apart from the fact that it had a no name cast and an anonymous crew  an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most i could do with it is laugh at the jaws like pretensions and  intentionally so  at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts cum boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on  the creature itself   a plesiosaur i e  half dinosaur half fish   is imperfectly realized  naturally  but  as had been the case with the giant claw   which i ve also just seen  this didn t seem to bother the film makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can  especially during the movie s second half
