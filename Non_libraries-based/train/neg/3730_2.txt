first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel  revelation  matthew   isaiah and other prophetic scriptures  there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message  so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations  as a christian  though an amillenialist  i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much  so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low   no  what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message  but rather its lack of production values  awful script  mediocre acting  and pitiful fx  this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the  s  no  this movie ranks down there with plan   from outerspace  this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel   the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this  but they failed  the left behind series  the apocalypse series  and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem  but their scripts are still poor  and their acting is wooden   there are great christian films  with extremely low budgets  but this film is not one of them  i m surprised the mst k crew never lampooned this one
