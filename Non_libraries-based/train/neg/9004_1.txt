nothing could have saved this movie  not even superman   ten years ago the special effects would have been amazing  better directing might have gotten some more feeling and better performances out of the actors  but nothing but feeding the script to a dragon could have fixed it  plot holes  bad lines  terrible pacing  endless replaying of the same shots of a cgi dragon stomping through hallways  ugh   avoid this one at all costs
