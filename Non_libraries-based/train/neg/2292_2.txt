first of all i must admit batman  the animated series is the best batman series by far  we watched it when it used to be on tv  i didn t realize that there was a season four  actually there wasn t  btas ends with season   and it should have stopped there   why did they have to mess with a good thing  catwoman and poison ivy now have terrible grey faces  the joker looks beyond scary  it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier  he doesn t seem to have pupils anymore  and now he doesn t even look remotely human  although he is   bruce wayne is voiced by kevin conroy who does the best batman  although he now looks like superman  there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same  bruce wayne now has blue eyes   night wing really needs a haircut  please  alfred just has pupils from eyes  looks more like a character from the  s   i have watched three episodes from disc   in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic  there is blood in every episode   if you are a fan of batman  the animated series  there is no batman season   they just included this series as season   for marketability  if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don t think as many people would have bought it   save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons
