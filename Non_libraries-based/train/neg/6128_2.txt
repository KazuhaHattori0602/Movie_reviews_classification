this movie was boring    yes  there are a few funny moments and jokes  but you cannot base a whole movie on that    the characters are too stereotyped  there is no real story   but short episodes with freaky side characters  who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine   shame  because most of the actors are acknowledged in hungary  a mystery why they took the roles    this is  not  a new hope for the hungarian film  it was boring  though it was meant to be genuine or unique  they could have tried much more harder than this    out of
