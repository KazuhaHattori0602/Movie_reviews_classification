clint eastwood is bronco billy  the leader of a wild west troupe  one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling to break even touring show  the seventh member of the bunch is a woman  billy s assistant  but such women never last long  and the position is chronically open  enter antoinette lilly  sandra locke   eastwood s girlfriend at the time  it seems miss lilly  as doc  scatman crothers  calls her  is a would be heiress who will only receive her long deceased father s estate if she s married by the time she turns   so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish geoffrey lewis   so  what s the plot of this film  it s hard to say  there s the romantic tension between billy and miss lilly  but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she s so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes  one of the troupe  halfway through the film  it s not only unbelievable  but the audience is well past caring about her  there s the chronic lack of funds behind the wild west show  but this topic isn t touched upon enough to really be the raison d etre of the film  there s miss lilly s predicament of being stranded in the rural west  cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury  she s mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press  but are we really supposed to believe that she couldn t get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort   no  the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family  a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin  this is a warm  fuzzy film   or at least tries to be    along the way  clint shows us his skills with a gun  even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non violent film  one of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge  billy bribes the local sheriff  the show s tent burns down  an orphanage makes them a new one  but numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make   compounding the problem is the acting  or lack thereof  aside from scatman crothers  the supporting cast is quite amateurish  eastwood isn t on top of his game either  though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch   and for all this  the film plods on for   minutes  to what point  good question
