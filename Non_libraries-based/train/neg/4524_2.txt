the robin cook novel  coma  had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in   a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment   but in the case of  sphinx  virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong  this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances  stupid dialogue  unconvincing characters and leaden pacing  the only reason it escapes a  out of  rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself  hard to believe franklin j  schaffner  of  patton  and  planet of the apes  is the director behind this debacle   pretty egyptologist erica baron  lesley anne down  is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu hamdi  john gielgud  hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge  consequently  he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop  the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica  for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i s long lost tomb  a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun s tomb in   before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop  with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end  afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen  erica attempts to track down the treasure  she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties  none of whom are truly trustworthy  for one there is yvon  maurice ronet  seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives  then there is akmed khazzan  frank langella  an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her   the biggest problems with  sphinx  generally result from its total disregard for plausibility  down couldn t be less convincing as a female egyptologist   one assumes she would be quite well educated and resourceful  yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick  on those rare occasions that she actually isn t running from a potential villain  she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a   year old tomb  the plot twists are heavy handed to say the least  mainly comprising of revelations and double crosses that can be predicted well in advance  one can t even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare  because the pacing is awfully sluggish  what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium  a famous review of the movie declared   sphinx stinks  never before has a  hour film been so aptly summed up in   words
