when i had first heard of  solar crisis  then got a load of the cast  i wondered why i had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before  then i saw it   now i know   for a movie that encompasses outer space  the sun  vast deserts and sprawling metropolises  this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature  it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera won t have to pull too far back   and the effects  while good  are pretty underwhelming  we re talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare  but other than shouting  sweating and a red glow about everything  there s no real feel of emergency   don t get me started about the cast  what heston  palance  matheson  boyle  et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone s guess  makes you wonder who else s condos aren t paid for in hollywood   and as far as the end goes  well  let s just say it s tense and intriguing but it s too little too late in an effort like this  if it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film  maybe i would have heard of  solar crisis  sooner   two stars  mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves    i wonder how alan smithee keeps his job doing junk like this
