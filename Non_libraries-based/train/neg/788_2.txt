a film with very little positive to say for it   firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama   besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again  i lost count of how many times i had seen  that  field at night or that bit of cracked earth   it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don t know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused  so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it s fine  we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre  beth has a key to a warehouse of books  there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie  much later  in fact too late   and on the point of the acre  horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary   and also if they re meant to be an acre big then make them so   there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth  the best performer in the piece  followed by jefferson   the cop  suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on  medication   with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child  did he crawl out of the window  he s six months old  the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene  bad plinky plonk  horror  music fails to add atmosphere   often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre  which is just bad
