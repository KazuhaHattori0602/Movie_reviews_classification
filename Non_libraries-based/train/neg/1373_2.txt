this was one of the worst films i have ever seen   i usually praise any film for some aspect of its production  but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film   most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it  er ok   also  trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work  running   feet into some trees is not gonna work  alas it does here  as mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous  in an enclosed space  with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea   anyway  about   minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation  however  if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate   it pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made   oh  did i mention the last five minutes  well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques  absolutely priceless
