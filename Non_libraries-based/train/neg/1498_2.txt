justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors  drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside  let s just take this movie as it s offered  without extraneous explanations   this movie is god awful  straight up craptastic  rather than rehash what may serve as a plot  i ll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head   a class  of   take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin  nowhere ireland  these students may be canadian or american  it s difficult to tell  that it was filmed in a canadian forest rather than ireland is rather obvious as well  one student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the  dumb jock  character from a number of kick ass  s movie  except when he channels randy from scream  one character may be chris klein s stunt double  he has a girlfriend who probably gets killed  but it s never really established if that is true  one character is sullen and removed from her peers just cuz  and then there s a blonde girl  yay blonde girl   ireland has a population of   they re cousins  gary  who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast  is called  sir  more than once  he s very ominous and wears a knit cap  his cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond   picturesque ireland features many canadian forests and swampy areas and   ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes   the producers got a discount on volume fake entrails  good for them   unbeknownst to me  horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives  perhaps there s some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register   also unbeknownst to me  if you inbreed for roughly   years  as the story leads us to believe happened  you end up being somewhat lumpy  yet amazingly spry and fairly strong  genetics are a wonderful game of craps   there may or may not be more than one freak in this film  reference is made to  them  and we see shadows  yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever  and when one odd looking dude is finally killed  apparently all danger is passed  i m running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up  thus they just used the one  that s what it looks like on screen  anyway   richard grieco should be ashamed   also of note  aside from those shiny new knives  the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear  as once richard grieco cuts his bonds  there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up who also then escapes  because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them  making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up   a dead body in a shack will be maggot ridden after what i would guess is about   hours has passed  said dead body will also have glasses on  when no characters wore them  curious   jenna jameson appears for no reason from stage left  chats for   minutes  vanishes stage left  in the middle of a giant forest  that s not unusual  as gary can also pop out of nowhere  which is also known as whatever exists in tv land off the screen   ms  jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie wouldn t suck wind   i offer a special nod to the  breeder  character  the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months  or maybe years  for breeding purposes  the poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua   the ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years   apparently this wasn t just random crap i found on the movie network late at night  apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it s production  how sad for you all  i have nothing more to say  may god have mercy on us all
