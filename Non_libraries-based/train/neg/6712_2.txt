i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music    is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children    is william daniels  campy contemporary  for the time  acting style meant to appeal to a  s s demographic    do we need all the  in jokes  about ny   nj   i can hear the blue haired broadway audience guffawing on cue    sorry  i find the whole piece dated  boring   the acting far too strident for the screen
