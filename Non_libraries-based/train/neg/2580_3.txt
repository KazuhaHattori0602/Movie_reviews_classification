well its official  they have just killed american pie  the first   were absolutely hysterical  but this one and the others have been awful  i mean the story is about two college fraternity s who battle each other for its houses  i mean come on talk about a weak plot  the first three dealt with growing up  change and marriage  which are all worthy points of development in human society   the new stifler is the biggest joke  i know its hard trying to compare yourself with the steven stifler but so no cigar  i give this movie a   because there is   funny bits in the film   the best character in this movie of course is jim s dad i don t know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films
