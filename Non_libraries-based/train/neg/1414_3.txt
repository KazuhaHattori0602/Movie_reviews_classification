after i watched this movie  i came to imdb and read some of the reviews  which compared it to lost in translation lite  when i read that i immediately could see the reviewers point   this movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme  interestingly  the format of the movie is nearly identical  but the pacing is incredibly different    items  rushes the viewer through the  day time line of the movie  whereas the better planned  lost in  seems to stretch out over a few long days   i m sure some people will see this because it has morgan freeman  and will be disappointed  it seems his better roles now a days are supporting roles in big blockbusters  rather than leading roles in sub mil limited release movies and indie films
