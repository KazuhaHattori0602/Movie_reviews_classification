i will never be a member of any club that would have me   especially this one   starr andreeff is a single mom stripper who gets attacked by a  female vampire and left for dead  she begins to get a hankering for  blood  and meets up with john savage  looking like he s  wondering where he left michael cimino s phone number  savage  is also a vampire and wants to let andreef join his little vampire  family  which consists of a british vamp  the blonde vamp who  attacked starr  and a green haired midget  i am not making this  up   the family does not want starr  so they try to kill savage and starr  and starr s kid   someone forgot to tell john savage that this was a drama  he  spends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than  hugh grant on a jolt cola bender  and he reads all of his lines like  he is making a farrelly brothers film  andreeff tries to make the  most of a badly written role  but screenwriter director ruben goes  for all the vampire cliches  like starr eating her son s pet hamster  and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood  the kid  also gets knocked around a lot  for those who think watching  violence against children is really entertaining   the film is extra gory  but not in a wild  over the top way like  killer  tongue  here  the gore is gross and never justified  it just occurs   it is just in the budget  most of the r rating goes to andreeff s  coworkers  who are put through embarassing strip routines in the  background of conversation scenes  the budget does not include  vampire fangs  all the vampires here must stab their prey to eat   nifty idea  unless you have already seen george romero s   martin   even at   minutes  and once you throw in ruben s attempts at  arty direction  skewed frames  blurred scenes  this is one  tiresome  dull  and dirty ride  leave this club and take a shower   you will need it   this is rated  r  for strong physical violence  gun violence  sexual  violence  strong gore  strong profanity  female nudity  sexual  references  drug abuse  and adult situations
