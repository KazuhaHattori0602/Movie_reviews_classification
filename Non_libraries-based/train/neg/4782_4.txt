 st watched       out of    dir robert ellis miller  emotional christmas fluff that doesn t really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them  the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington d c  to enlist the then president of the united states  herbert hoover  this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer  which makes the story kind of like a disney  animals on the run  movie and doesn t quite fit here  at the ending  there isn t any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint to the movie  in my opinion  the movie does eventually bring tears  but it takes too long to get to this  the movie isn t supposed to have been an original tv movie according to imdb  but it has the obvious fade outs that make it look this way   so i m not sure their information is accurate  all in all  this is a simple movie that could have been more complex  with a happy christmas like story but blandly played and without a lot of substance
