basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child  at the adoption agency they meet a mouse  stuart  and they decide to adopt him  if you think that this is stupid  hold it  because it s getting worse   stuart arrives to his new home  where he is treated like a human child   spare me  the rest is pretty much the usual clich  about family problems  jealousy from the elder  brother  and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a  happy family  boring and worn out as this is  it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way   i don t know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich  or he was just trying to fill in minutes  but he only upgraded the clich  from boring to abhorrent   then why i gave a   and not a zero  because of the family cat  who loves stuart as much as the  brother  and because of some funny gigs  where stuart makes good use of his small size   on the overall i believe that the film would work reasonably well if  a  stuart was a pet and not a  sibling  b  it had kept to the funny gigs  like stuart trying to outwit the cat  and had left out boring clich s which don t even match with anything else
