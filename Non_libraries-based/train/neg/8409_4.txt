eddie murphy for best supporting actor  what an insult to alan arkin and djimon hounsou    jamie foxx  who can act  walks through this film like a zombie    beyonce   that was acting    this movie pales in comparison to chicago or just about any other recent musical    if it were not for the great singing and performance of jennifer hudson i would have given this a zero   and no i never saw the stage play so i am not making the typical broadway vs  hollywood rap
