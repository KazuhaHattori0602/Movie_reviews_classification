  mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon  i did not see anything like that  just a bad  boring film with unlikable characters and a trite  sophomoric plot  giada colagrande is either paralyzed from the mouth up or botoxed to the gills  and nary an expression touches her face  and her name makes me think of super sizing a beverage at taco bell   i ll have the cola grande  it was actually kind of fun it was so bad  i got to play like i was in my own mystery science theater   noting things like the fact that dafoe s skin is too big for his face  it s really like silly putty
