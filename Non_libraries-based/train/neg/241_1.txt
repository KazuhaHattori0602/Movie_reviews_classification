in director sooraj barjatya s vivah something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure  small town girl his father has selected for him to marry  drawn to her innocence and simplicity  shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he s met her at her home in madhupur  and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor  the marriage is fixed for six months later  and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young  budding love  their geographical distance notwithstanding  but amrita  who s been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents  death  is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage  and then  it s up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain  barjatya s new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise  but sadly  the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated  even more far fetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps  and the problem is clear   you just can t relate to such squeaky clean characters who don t have one bad bone in their bodies  there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films  and timing is one such important factor  twenty five years ago  perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch  but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp  perhaps the film s only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish  you can make out right away that the filmmaker s intention is not to deceive  judging both by barjatya s previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world  he believes in his good as gold characters  he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps but alas  he s unable to translate his vision to the screen  it s difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are   shahid and amrita  both virtuous and virginal   i mean  think about it  the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film  barjatya may think he s returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah  but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film  or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry  because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah  those pairs had mischief and masti  shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story  the filmmaker chooses a string of  s style tunes that only further slacken the film s deadening pace  but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn t work for me  it s because i m not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatya s story  to some perhaps  vivah will give hope  that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere  but i m a little cynical i guess  so  give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun  give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya  i ll even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain  but save me from these dullards  you know  some marriages aren t made in heaven  this one s vivah
