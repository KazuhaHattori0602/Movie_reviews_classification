as a long time fan of superman from the comics  through the  s series  the first two of the chris reeves films and lois   clark  and finally smallville  i was  really  hoping for something clever with  superman returns   instead we got lex luthor making  another  attempt at real estate conversion  another superman beaten up while wearing kryptonite sequence  and internal inconsistencies  he couldn t stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with   of kryptonite  but when lois breaks off   of it   leaving the rest embedded in him  he can lift  a continent  into space  really  the only hero in the story was lois  partner   i can t remember his name off hand  he did all kinds of life saving  heroic things with nothing but guts and skill   no superpowers  no invulnerability just a normal human   they keep making superman so small  why can t we have superman battling brainiac or fighting to save the universe from general zod instead of lex s petty schemes  oh  i forgot they re doing that in smallville   yeah i think i ll stick to smallville   you probably should  too
