i will admit that i did not give this movie much of a chance  i decided pretty early on that this just wasn t my kind of movie   for the most part  it has an excellent look in terms of its cinematography  the scenes of early  s manhattan look very good  as does the lead actress  it is a very crisp black and white  which could almost make the movie feel undated and fresh  however  some of the other techniques the filmmakers employ shoot that prospect all to hell  the disjointed editing is very late s  somewhere between surrealism and new wave  the story also feels like it came from a very specific time  somewhere between free love idealism and artsy experimentation   the film follows a young girl around the city as she looks for a man who she had anonymous phone sex with  as she meets other odd characters  she reveals her quirks and they reveal theirs  the movie seems to be meant as an off the wall  irreverent comedy  but adds an avant garde feel  i would expect that if you like andy warhol movies  you would be very excited to discover the telephone book   some problems i had  near the end of the movie  one character tells a rambling anecdote that lasts over twelve minutes brutal to sit through  also  there is a very explicit animation sequence that i found gross and juvenile that serves as the film s climax  i did laugh out loud four or five times  and i liked the ending  minus the flat out disgusting animation  and when the film switched to color for the final phone booth at night sequence  i actually liked the way it looked even better  it ended up being one of those experiences where i felt like i could have really liked it if it been a little different  but this is what the filmmakers gave us  it is obscure  artsy  and way left of the dial  but none of those are reasons to recommend it on their own  i didn t find it to be unique or creative so much as forced and pretentious
