this film has an interesting plot  but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor  i was very disappointed  the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one  but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered    of the   other people in the theater left after about   minutes and the other   were laughing at how bad the film was  i stuck it out to the end  but i must admit i played blackjack on my cell phone to make the last   minutes bearable
