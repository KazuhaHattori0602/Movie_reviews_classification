what a wasted cast   this is one of the most disappointing films i ve seen   usually roger ebert does not let me down  but i feel cheated after seeing this movie   the only thrill is seeing elizabeth banks in her bra  that is a sorry statement about this movie  it held so much promise  but it was like dry humping a transvestite   this is self absorbed tripe   i cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie  and hope i can forewarn you of the same disappointment
