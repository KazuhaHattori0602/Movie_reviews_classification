when i first popped in happy birthday to me  i checked the timer to see how long the film was  i was amazed at the length  both animated and horror films share a common ground  attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around   minutes  anything more  and you ll lose the bulk of your audience   this   minutes  or   minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me  i d like to say half of this movie could ve been edited out  but i would be too generous to say that  go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could ve been edited  even without being a film major   regardless of the overstayed visit  the movie was below mediocre  it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the  elite   is killing off the remaining friends  for the most part  they not only over do it  but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say  it s this guy  no  it s this gal  you ll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie  and don t get me started on the acting   okay  that got me started  i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie  later  research proved my suspicions correct  because all the way through this movie  she genuinely looked blind  strange  as an established actress  she should ve been the best of the group  but turned out the worst  the rest of the staff  aside from ann  bregman  was pretty damn bad  too  but she  uh  took the cake   the movie begins with a group of ten friends  and one s immediately killed off  barely anyone thinks twice of this  dear  friend s disappearance  so they continue on their merry way  slowly  then more rapidly  there are revelations about virginia s  anderson  the main character  past and her psychologist  who s a tad bit more personal  and on call   apparently  than most shrinks  all the while  more and more deaths occur   what s funny is  just as the first  disappearance  the more  best buds  vanish  the less the rest care  sure  they give a few seconds of air time to say  wow   that person  just wouldn t run off  etc  but then they re back to their sexual ways  and speaking of which  it s probably due to the horrid script  or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute   but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene  see  the creepy guy that kept a mouse rat in his pocket   literally   and was the most obvious suspect  i m giving the film too much credit  and time  but how he became part of the  elite   i ll never know   but  i digress  there s a mystery here  why are these kids targets  why is virginia thinking she s killed someone  when it was never proved  till the end  that any of them actually has been slaughtered  and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be  six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see  hell  even for   most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the  th films   coincidentally enough  friday the  th part   was released   weeks to the day of happy birthday to me  perhaps  they re speaking of when they filmed it months prior  but were late to the  well  party   when the  secrets  are revealed  trust me  you ll have to rewind  x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives  and even then  put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim killer s words  even if you get the first time  it s an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale  it s almost worth watching the whole movie again  but as a drinking game   this birthday gathering should be avoided  it s a horrible and illogical first draft script   please  please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role  it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it s   unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances   side note  when i was a kid  or say   years old  i loved horror films   still do  oddly  definite guilty pleasures  but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass  we got our first vcr  and i taped as many horror films off network  or  edited versions  tv  all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last   minutes on tape  which scared me to death   and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was  even though i have seen other clips of this movie  i think this is the first full length viewing i ve had  thankfully  this awful movie didn t wound me as a child  i am older now  and i can take this trash  but never again   side note   that said  that crazy  happy birthday to me  song played in the end credits  and as a score throughout  still creeps me out tremendously  i guess  this movie  or last few minutes  did have an influence on my childhood  shame on you  melissa sue anderson
