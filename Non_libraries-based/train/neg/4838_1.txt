i decided to watch this one because it s been nominated for oscar this year  i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie  but ended up bored and disappointed  first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in  shaky hands  camera mode is really annoying   i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this   american  military machine   people  who makes money on war  urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something  sort of  patriotic   why these  heroic  efforts of director and the main character to _inspire_ the audience with an idea of  loving war like a drug  oh  please  come on  what a bore    watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall
