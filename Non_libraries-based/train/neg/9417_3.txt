when the remake of when a stranger calls was out  obviously i was interested in watching the original  then when i read about the original  which i recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day  i saw that the real money is on black christmas  which apparently beat everyone to the  the caller is in the house  punch  so i netflix that  and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its  very long wait  all this time i am getting more and more eager to see it  then one day  out of the blue  it finally arrives   and it s a total snore   sure  maybe i had elevated expectations  but i don t think it would have gained more had i seen it fresh  the thing is it s christmas in some canadian college town  and there s this sorority having a party  we see some killer pov shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic  so we know he s in the house  then we re introduced to our characters olivia hussey as the mousy  whiny  canadian accented jess  margot kidder as the annoying  overtly aggressive alcoholic barb  she s so annoying even her mother dis invites her for her christmas festivities  there s also this irritating janis ian clone  phil  and this alcoholic den mother mrs  mac  seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house  we also meet jess s highly strung boyfriend peter  played by keir dullea of   and bunny lake is missing fame  though halfway through the film i was still asking myself  which one s keir dullea   so it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls  but this was before email  so they couldn t ask him to send a photo  then well  you know how they say those plastic dry cleaning bags are not a toy  one of the sisters finds that out the hard way  don t worry if you don t catch the first   shots of the plastic encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic there ll be   more interspersed throughout the film  obviously there to make you say  oh my god  there s a corpse in the attic  though after the first hour that changes to   how come the dumb police haven t found the rather prominently placed plastic encased corpse in the attic  especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house  really  any time before csi came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime  the cops are so dumb  fortunately some of them look like john saxon   anyway  after a lot more darn boring human drama  the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy looking trap door that rests atop it  those wily cats  for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble  now we have two corpses up in the attic hey  why don t we have   more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now two corpses in the attic   so by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously  and tap the houses  phone and station a cop outside  they inform jess and her pal janis ian that if the obscene caller calls back  they need to keep him on the phone  jessica  who has grown even more whiny  mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller  who is this  what do you want  who are you  after like the first   calls  when it is clear that he is not going to answer her  isn t that like a sign a developmental disability  the inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something  and what s he going to do  suddenly say  oh yeah  hi  it s bob from the laundromat  dumb jess   spoilers  anyway  soon janis ian and lois lane  kidder  are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces  this film s idea of gore  and idiot jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked  hello  are you being stalked or what  then the cops realize that the killer is in the house  and call jess and tell her  don t ask questions  just do as i say
 walk to the front door and get out  so what does moron jess do  starts screaming  phil  barb  phil  barb  hey  great idea sister  now why don t you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking  of course she does  and sees her former friends  all splashed with ketchup  prompting this viewer to scream at the screen   have a clue now   now  obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place  and that it doesn t move to the same pace we re used to  and seeing a plastic covered corpse in the attic like   times probably was scary back in the day  and people weren t used to being stalked by psychopaths  so they wouldn t think to  you know  lock the doors or windows  and they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there  you see  people were stupid back in the  s  we have to understand that  one of the big shocks is that we don t even see our proto final girl kill the psycho  but believe me  that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for  spoilers end      hey  check out cinema de merde  my website on bad and cheesy movies  with a few good movies thrown in  you can find the url in my email address above
