definitely  definitely the worst film i ve ever seen  no questions asked  contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others  since it s an independent  low budget film  but c mon already   the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying   agreeing with everything that has been said about this film  for example the mind numbingly weak acting  when it s this bad you take another go at shooting the scene  god damn it  the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script  assuming such a thing existed during the production  there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers  the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains   five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath   gang up on her  why don t you   the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it   which is  as the rest of the film  a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully   
oh and by the way  this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand held camera   this is an effect and not a trait  used cleverly it can be breathtaking  but in this case it s an excuse for inadequate cinematography
