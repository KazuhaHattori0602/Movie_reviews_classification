run do not walk away from this movie  aimed at the very young kids  this movie will bore you to tears  if the gamera trilogy of the  s raised the bar  this film just lowered it  it s slow paced and the monster fighting is good  but seldom seen  this movie had me dry heaving in the cat box  just a very poor offering after a phenomenal  s series   spoilers beyond this point  here are the top   reasons gamera fans of the  s series will hate this film     this movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult gamera die     you see the adult gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film  he gets his butt kicked by a few gyaos and self destructs  he looks old and lethargic  plus he looks nothing like any gamera you ve ever seen  his suit looked cheap and rushed     the young gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a pokemon  big eyed and cute it will remind you of the baby godzilla from godzilla vs mechagodzilla   gamera is now too cute     this movie has the pace of watching a nascar race during a   hour rain delay  i watched this movie with   other gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along  i ve seen an suv full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster     like godzilla final wars  this movie had very little kaiju time on screen  final wars had much more  actually  and better fights although short     kids take the title role  the friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original gamera series in the  s and history repeats itself in the  s  the most successful gamera films abandoned the sesame street feel and went to a darker place  why go back to a failed formula  this was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue  thank god     gamera lost his iconic roar  he now sounds like an elephant with strep throat     this movie may produce a new olympic event imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm s way  you have to see the ending to understand this point  where were the parents  oh yea right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone     the special effects were good  but sub par for a gamera movie  legion and iris had better effects  the best effect was showing the apple sized baby gamera fly  not too impressive     this movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect  the director was involved in power rangers and it shows  it comes off like a cross between et  always  sunset on third street and tmnt  kudos if you know all   references   rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the dvd series
