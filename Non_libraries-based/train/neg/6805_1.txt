i ve finished seeing the movie   minutes ago wow i still cant believe what i ve watched   this is absolutely the worst movie ever  if i would list all the flaws in the movie   this review would take me a lot of sentences  very funny flaws  because of being that bad though   you got to be amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane  they didn t even know how to move   ice t is so bad actor  and the thing i don t understand  is how the production wanted him to be like a hero  but he s a zero   of course the major flaws will be the landing of an   needing only   or   tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane amazing  as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all   but i strongly recommend of watching this movie  as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
