man would expect that a movie shot with an approx  budget of   u d should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it   matrix reloaded  proves this assumption wrong    the matrix  worked out better  despite having apparent holes concerning logic of the story  at least nobody could explain to me why beating up a bot  aka agent  inside a simulation  aka martix  would harm the responsible computer program in any way   unfortunately  the wachowski brothers made excactly this  agent bashing  the main thing in  matrix reloaded  it s a beat  em up o rama  this fighting scenes may be work out sufficient  or even cool  in a   sec  trailer  but prolonged for several minutes  apparently being faked  choreographed poorly and repeated over and over again it is nothing more than boring  despite seeing the promised spectecular stunts there is nothing more than simple low quality  unimaginative bashing already seen  or better not  in eg  van damme  movies  the difference of post production  etherything is   times faster  the camera floats around a lot and freezes on certain scenes  and this is repeated for at least  min  doesn t help here  all this has nothing to do with the very meaning of  martial arts  beside these  fights  all actors do refuse to do what they are payed for  acting   what s up besides the fighting scenes  few except hollywood routine  this oh so multicultural bunch of hippies which sucked in  waterworld  are recycled as citizen of  zion   mans last city on earth  and on the order of morpheus they start dancing   cause this is a good opportunity to show a lot of barely covered tits and butts  the oh so popular clich e of the frog aka frenchmen talking with this  je ne sais quoi  dumb accent  who wastes his fortune because of a  liason d amour  is bravely served  following this  and unwanted funny  is the fight between neo and the sinister followers of  the frog  since it takes place in an erroy flynn like enterieur  luckily featuring a lot of mideaval weapons for decoration  for neo posing with the hellebarde  just add   stairs and a lot of statues  for being destructed  thrown over evil guys and the like  and you get   more senseless  boring min  of this junk   whats left to expect  the usual merchandising hell  and  revolutions  which will happen or not   certainly without me
