this weekend just passed i watched   weeks later  which was very good  after that i watched this film    i have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch  the scenes were unrealistic  there was no script and no plot  the alien creature was unreal  and the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight  and to make it worse the guy named cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film   forget about this movie  rather go and watch   weeks later   cheers  mesake c
