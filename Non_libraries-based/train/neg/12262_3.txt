fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately  blood surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid  redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down  crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal  crocodile   directed by a disappointing tobe hooper  and  lake placid  blood surf is every bit as bad as these other films and   on top of that   it likes to exaggerate tremendously  the saltwater crocodile supposedly is   years old  over   ft long   and it kills for fun  during the film  he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes   dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area  the only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location  even though it s a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this  the lagoons and nature looks marvelous  every other aspect is simply disastrous  there s a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable  the dialogues are downright painful to listen to  you won t believe some of the lines these actors have to say  i know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but i hope for their own sake they re not that stupid  early in the film  one of the characters refers to jaws as being a  mechanical toy  but the croc here looks at least   times less real than spielberg s great white shark  the visual effects in  blood surf  are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress  i won t say too much about the acting since it s secondary in flicks like this  the girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast  you guessed right  blood surf is a very bad film  so bad it becomes fun again  but  funny  for a whole other reason than james hickox intended
