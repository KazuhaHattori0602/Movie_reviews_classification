i ve read all the comments on this film  i am a great admirer  of the dalai lama  as such  i read the book upon which this  film was based  the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth  i do not criticize it for  altering small details or events for dramatic purposes  it is  not a documentary  but the script changes the impact  reaction   realities  and changes in every main character  it vastly alters  the real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama    from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman  which demeans  the culture of tibet  to harra s music box gift  to harrar s  change of heart  everything about this movie is false   except  for the amazing photography  i understand that the shots of the  potala  the palace  were smuggled out of tibet  however   changing a real story about the relationship between two people   one of them very important to this world  in order to build up a  movie star is sad
