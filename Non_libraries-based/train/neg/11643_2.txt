though the title may suggest examples of the   commandments  it is a definitely incorrect assumption  this is an adaptation of   seemingly unrelated stories from giovanni bocaccio s  th century  decameron  story collection   set within a medieval italian town s largely peasant population  it is a diatribe on the reality of sex  and its consequences  within that world and time  a realistic view of life within this world  it sometimes feels like a journey back in time   given the depicted human element of its time  one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists   as well as the ironies of life  at times  or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the catholic church s rules   nothing terribly special  but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
