jack london s life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him  sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character   jack london who barely saw the age of   when he died wrote some of the best stories around  he wrote on what he knew  but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him  some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism  but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the  yellow peril  as it was called back in the day   two thirds of the film covers his life as author  we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf  we see him up in the yukon in a miner s cabin with a dog that was no doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild  london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since   the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo japanese war  london was a socialist  but his socialism did not encompass folks who were oriental  like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people  he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals   the film puts the cart before the horse  london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what japan s ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was  actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not existent during the russo japanese conflict  japan had her imperial ambitions  but so did everyone else including the usa at that time  but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations  london was part of the cause not a prophet crying in the wilderness   this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london  had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy  both who would have been right for the role  instead they got michael o shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque  o shea is fine in the part  but certainly was no box office   as london is covering the war  he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong  an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii  from the vantage point in   strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan s imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually  must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd    a lot of course is left out of london s life including a first wife  playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it s half over  i wish we d have seen more of her  charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost   years dying in    o shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london  virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for   years until o shea died in    maybe one day we ll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one
