who are these  they  the actors  the filmmakers  certainly couldn t be the audience  this is among the most air puffed productions in existence  it s the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shoot  too much fun  nobody is getting any actual work done  and that almost always makes for a movie that s no fun to watch   ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character s status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled bogdanovich  the scenes with the breezy ms  stratten are sweet  but have an embarrassing  look guys i m dating the prom queen feel to them  ben gazzara sports his usual cat s got canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot  which requires him to pursue audrey hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic  in the meantime  the budding couple s respective children  nepotism alert  bogdanovich s daughters  spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on  love  while observing their parents   ms  hepburn  drawing on her dignity  manages to rise above the proceedings  but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself  ostensibly  everybody looks great  but so what  it s a movie and we can expect that much  if that s what you re looking for you d be better off picking up a copy of vogue   oh  and it has to be mentioned that colleen camp thoroughly annoys  even apart from her singing  which  while competent  is wholly unconvincing  the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack  surely this is not what gershwin  who wrote the song from which the movie s title is derived  had in mind  his stage musicals of the  s may have been slight  but at least they were long on charm   they all laughed  tries to coast on its good intentions  but nobody  least of all peter bogdanovich   has the good sense to put on the brakes   due in no small part to the tragic death of dorothy stratten  this movie has a special place in the heart of mr  bogdanovich  he even bought it back from its producers  then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn t prove popular  his rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of hollywood stories  so there s no joy in criticizing the film  there _is_ real emotional investment in ms  stratten s scenes  but  laughed  is a faint echo of  the last picture show   paper moon  or  what s up  doc  following  daisy miller  and  at long last love  it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which p b  has never emerged   all in all  though  the movie is harmless  only a waste of rental  i want to watch people having a good time  i ll go to the park on a sunny day  for filmic expressions of joy and love  i ll stick to ernest lubitsch and jaques demy
