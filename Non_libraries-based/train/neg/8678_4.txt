after watching  the bodyguard  last night  i felt compelled to write a review of it   this could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camera work  it was beyond annoying  the angles were all wrong  it was impossible to see anything  especially during the fight sequences  the closeups were even horrible   the story has sonny chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring  he is approached by judy lee  who is never quite straight with chiba  lee s involvement in the drug ring is deeper than chiba thought  as the mob and another gang of thugs are after her   the story was decent  and despite horrible dubbing  this could have been a good movie  given better direction and editing  i m sure this would have been a classic kung foo movie  as it is  it s more like another cheesy  s action movie   note  the opening sequence has a quote familiar to  pulp fiction  fans  and then continues to a karate school in times square that is in no way related to the rest of the movie   rating    out of
