this wasn t what i wanted to see  i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment   heres what i didn t like     they were shooting at the father    the tribes was really annoying    the dinosaurs  mostly looked to faked    the bad scientist well he was annoying    the picture quality on the dvd was really bad  what i did like      the music by jerry goldsmith  this music is really great  i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie  sadly the sound quality is not good  but its ok for its time     the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe     baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing    that funny scene with the tent      the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
