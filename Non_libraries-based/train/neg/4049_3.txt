i didn t like this bill murray vehicle when it was originally released in the  s  so i tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie going tastes in the  s or was it that  stripes  is simply a bad movie  well  the verdict is in and  stripes  is a bad movie   now   stripes  may have been innovative comedy in the early  s  and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are bill murray fans  but its still a bad movie   why is it bad  mostly because  stripes  is supposed to be a comedy but it s just not that funny  there are some laughs  but they are few and far between  most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting  this lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you re used to more contemporary comedies such as  anchorman  which strive for laughs in every part of the movie    stripes  further suffers from bill murray and harold ramis s lack of acting ability  bill murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career  and harold ramis is playing harold ramis  these two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie   lastly  most of the comedy that there is in  stripes  revolves around bill murray s self centered  smart alec man child character so if you don t find that character funny  like i didn t  you re not going to find most of what little comedy there is in  stripes  funny either    stripes  is very much a movie of its era  it hasn t aged well and is not worth watching  if you want to watch an early  s  buddy  comedy i would recommend  stir crazy  like  stripes  the humor in  stir crazy  is not as fast paced as in contemporary comedies  but unlike  stripes  it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable
