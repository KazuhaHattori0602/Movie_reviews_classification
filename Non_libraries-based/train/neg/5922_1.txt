my mother keeps a cassette of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who annoys her  everything about it stinks   as such it is a true classic   who gave it   were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one   everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film  it should be an indelible stain on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be revered as the tide mark of the cinematically dire
