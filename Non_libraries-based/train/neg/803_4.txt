i have read the novel reaper of ben mezrich a fews years ago and last night i accidentally came to see this adaption   although it s been years since i read the story the first time  the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous  very important elements  which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad   if the plot sounds interesting to you  go and get the novel  its much  much  much better   still   out of   since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by ben mezrich
