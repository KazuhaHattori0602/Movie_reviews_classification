prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film  you know the one  this october  lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving  insert disease name here  to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend  it s dramatic 
 it s sappy 
 it s immensely dull  it does nothing to further a genre  tell an original story  or strive for any sort of newness  prom night shares this plight  watching the killer poke holes in his victims  we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled  it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history   our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier  think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife  you d probably go 
  oh  good lookin guy is going to kill me  naaaa  not scary even for a second  so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror  this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator  you ll get   jump scares in this film    of which made my date jump  i might mention she is afraid of everything  i d also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me   as if this film were not disjointed enough  it appears to be cut to shreds  i m not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film  i m saying as the film moves from scene to scene  you often get a jarring jump  this is the kind of thing you d expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together  cross his fingers  and hope for the best  the editor should be shot   with a plot you can pack into two sentences  one stray spray of blood  an emo killer  and the tension of a very special episode of  silver spoons  we re left with no reason to support horror this weekend 
 at least on the big screen  in fact  this is the sort of film that should be punished  is it really that hard to make a scary movie  was this crew even aware they were making a horror film  a complete waste of my time and yours  i bit the bullet to get you this review  don t let my sacrifice be in vain  don t go into the movie
