like with any movie genre  there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies  if you asked me to name a good gangster movie  i d have dozens to choose from  if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie  probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you  the last time  that film is  the general  unrelated to the   silent film of the same name  this is a very dry  very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story  it s more than easy to follow  but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor   like  goodfellas    and  american gangster   two superior mob movies the general  is based on real people and true events  the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill  brendan gleeson  who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult  meanwhile  the police led by an inspector named kenny  jon voight  try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict  or kill  him   perhaps because it s a film in the same category as the marvelous  goodfellas    and the first two  godfather  films  i was expecting too much from  the general  but that may be going too easy on it  this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes  let s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented  for some reason  director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full fledged color film  now i have nothing against b w pictures  not even ones made in modern day times   schindler s list    was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and it s a masterpiece   the general  made just five years after  schindler s list  is not  the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that i found simply annoying  the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist s documentary like style  like  schindler s list  did  but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time  too much like a classic style motion picture  performances in the film range from passable to poor  brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles  but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting  the sound design is also very primitive  probably in an attempt to give it a  s crime noir appeal  but that also fails because again  it s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place   but the worst thing that occurs is that there s not one not one character in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for  in fact  for every moment of every scene  the only thought going through my head was  okay
so what  moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time consuming here  i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull  gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did  if a character is killed off  as they always are in gangster films  we feel nothing  no remorse  no relief  no surprise  nothing  we just say  so what  and that s all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy  very poorly made crime film
