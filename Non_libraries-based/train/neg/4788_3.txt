in the third entry of the phantasm series  mike and reggie continue chasing the tall man  assisted by a trigger happy   year old  a black g i  jane and the spirit of mike s deceased brother  he died in the original phantasm  number   is a rather disappointing sequel  since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in phantasm ii  i got the feeling the stress was merely laid on reggie s incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand up comedian  the humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed  which fits a story like this better  also  the settings aren t as macabre here  plus the constant presence of the tall man  agnus schrim  isn t as obvious
 there still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time  by the way  beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off screen  the entire phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of don coscarelli  who wrote and directed   episodes so far
the fifth being in production  the first one is a semi cult classic  the second is a horror feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped  a  michael baldwin returns as mike  even though james legros portrayed his character a lot better in phantasm ii
