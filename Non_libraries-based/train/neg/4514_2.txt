the trouble with the book   memoirs of a geisha  is that it had japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an american man s way of thinking  reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music  sets  and costumes yet performed by barnyard animals dressed in those costumes so far from japanese ways of thinking were the characters   the movie isn t about japan or real geisha  it is a story about a few american men s mistaken ideas about japan and geisha filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions  so what is this movie if it isn t about japan or geisha  is it pure fantasy as so many people have said  yes  but then why make it into an american fantasy   there were so many missed opportunities  imagine a culture where there are no puritanical hang ups  no connotations of sin about sex  sex is natural and normal  how is sex handled in this movie  right  like it was dirty  the closest thing to a sex scene in the movie has sayuri wrinkling up her nose and grimacing with distaste for five seconds as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on her crotch    does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie  nope  one character is said to be promiscuous but all we see is her pushing away her lover because it looks like she doesn t want to get caught doing something dirty  such typical american puritanism has no place in a movie about japanese geisha   did sayuri enjoy her first ravishing by some old codger after her cherry was auctioned off  nope  she lies there like a cold slab of meat on a chopping block  of course she isn t supposed to enjoy it  and that is what i mean about this movie  why couldn t they have given her something to enjoy  why does all the sex have to be sinful and wrong   behind mameha the chairman was sayuri s secret patron  and as such he was behind the auction of her virginity  he could have rigged the auction and won her himself  nobu didn t even bid  so why did the chairman let that old codger win her and  reeking of old man stink  get his fingers all over her naked body  would any woman ever really forgive a man for that   let s try to make sense of this  by being behind mameha the chairman incurred debts for sayuri s geisha training  in order to recoup his debts the chairman had sayuri sold to dr  crab  through mameha the chairman sold sayuri s sexual favors to that old geezer so that the chairman could make some money out of her  the chairman wasn t her patron  he was her pimp  some romantic love story   yes  the film is gorgeous but it is like the beauty of a very attractive  alluring transvestite whose voice  appearance and every touch are thrilling  but under that very feminine surface lies an ominous secret  under the incorrectly appearing japanese surface of the film lurks the ominous secret that the heart  soul  spirit and core of this film is entirely american and male  not the best thing to be if it is trying to be other than a lie  distortion  and terribly wrong   some contrasts between japan and moag   japanese style   refined  elegant simplicity  moag style   peking opera   japanese geisha   hair swept up  moag geisha   loose hair which surely must have gotten all gunked up in the thick paste of white makeup   japanese shaved ice   japanese are rather strict about seasonal observances  shaved ice is strictly a summer treat  moag shaved ice   the chairman buys chiyo  the young sayuri played by the marvelous suzuka ohgo  this treat during cherry blossom viewing season  the thought made my entire body shiver with cold   japanese geisha   trained and skilled entertainers  moag geisha   sluts   japanese wind chime   used in the summer because hearing the sound it makes  thanks to the breeze  japanese people feel somehow cooler  moag wind chime   a door bell  if a person stood in front of another s house and made noises with a wind chime they would be considered a lunatic  not gain entrance   japan   emphasis on human relationships  group oriented  moag    i want a life that s mine  american individualism   japanese traditional dance   refined elegance  an almost geometrical and mechanical precision  moag dance   martha graham freaking out on lsd while wearing a not very auspicious white japanese funeral shroud  performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club  ha ha ha  is a strip club where they did most of their research on geisha   japan house fire   setting or even letting a fire break out is worse than murder because it poses such a dire threat to the community  fires can rip through those wooden villages  towns  and cities destroying hundreds or thousands of homes and killing as many people  moag house fire   great adjunct to a fight scene but there are zero ramifications and because it is no longer needed the out of control fire miraculously puts itself out  technically the movie ended here because at the very least sayuri would have been ostracized and joined her sister among those never heard from again  which is where both arthur golden and rob marshall should be exiled   enough  the movie stinks
