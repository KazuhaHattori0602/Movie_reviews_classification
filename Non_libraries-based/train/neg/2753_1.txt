first off i d like to point out that sam niel is nowhere to be seen in this film  what s a movie without sam niel  did anyone see event horizon  d wars did have potential a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launchers does sound cool but sadly isn t  nope  no sam niel  no good movie  i recommend taking the   dollars or so it takes to rent d wars and adding   to that five and buying a sam niel film  apparently to submit this i have to have ten lines of text so heres a list of sam niel movies i recommend   jurassic park  dead calm  hunt for red october  event horizon  not jurassic park three  overall d wars is a pile
