 then you d better not watch this movie  they ve completely ruined the premise of the show  in the movie the duke boys are idiots  daisy is trampy  roscoe is sinister  boss hogg is capable  uncle jessie is a criminal only cooter and flash are true to the original characters  at least enos is kinda close   at one point they open the doors to get into the general lee   nuff said   the original show may not have been great tv  but it was entertaining and the characters made sense  this movie is like dumb   dumber meets the simple life
