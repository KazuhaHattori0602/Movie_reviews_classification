remakes  and sequels  have been a staple of cinema from the beginning of the media  it is pretty much a hit or miss venture though  if you take what s good of the original and build upon it and update key features too current standards  you can have a success  note  such films like the thief of bagdad   or king kong   succeeded in their attempts  others like king kong   fail  miserably   brief encounter   is the template for this film  it is as perfect as could be made on such a subject and we rate it imdb ten  the story is simple  love  innocently found by accident and tragically lost  why  it just happened for the two   principals involved at the wrong time  these are portrayed in a convincing and sensitive manner by trevor howard and cecilia johnson  neither are conventionally leading star material  but quality character actors  for the details watch the film   now what went wrong  a t v  movie  remade practically scene for scene with name actors richard burton and sophia loren should have at least scored imdb six  both actors though appear disinterested  just showing up to punch their time clocks and pick up their checks  neither are involved with their characters or with each other  you do not believe they are in love or when they finally separate it is any great loss to either of them  that should not be and that s why it fails in its intent  sometimes it is just better to leave things alone
