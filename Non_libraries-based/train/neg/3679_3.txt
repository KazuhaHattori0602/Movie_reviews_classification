this is a japanese film but there is quite a bit of english also spoken in here  it s a pretty film  with nice visuals  featuring the scenic beauty of hawaii   however  that was the only redeeming quality for me  the story was generally boring  who wants to watch a young woman sulk for   percent of the film because her  picture  husband is a lot older than he advertised he was  granted  that could be a bummer but get over it   only in the last   minutes does she do an about face and become fond of him  by then  for most viewers  it was too little too late  we d fallen asleep by then
