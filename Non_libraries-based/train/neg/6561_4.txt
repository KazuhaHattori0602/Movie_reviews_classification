the opening sequence is supposed to show the legion arriving in paris on   nov   the troops pile off the train   wearing the uniform in which the french army  including the legion  marched off to war in   this a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey   the french army realized by   that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working  metropolitan french troops were put into  horizon blue  and colonial troops were put into khaki  the claude van damme  sp  remake at least got the uniforms more or less right  really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right
