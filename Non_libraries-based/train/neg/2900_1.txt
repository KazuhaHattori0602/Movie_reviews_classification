i have a   minute rule  sometimes i ll leave leway for   if a movie is not good in the first   or   minutes it s probably not going to ever get better  i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory  dan in real life is definitely no exception  i was watching this turkey and thought  wow  this is not funny  not touching  not sad  and i don t like any of the characters at all   the story of an advice columnist widower raising three young daughters  who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend  i suppose the tagline would be  advice columnist who could use advice  i don t know  dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice  i guess that s the irony  i don t know  he goes to see his parents  brothers  sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat  which seems very sweet  and potential fodder for good comedy  story lines none which ever emerge  the central story is basically how he loves this woman  but can t have her  anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her  but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny  trite  lifetime movie network dialogue  murderer of love  to get to the inevitable happy ending   this is truly one of the worst movies i ve ever seen
