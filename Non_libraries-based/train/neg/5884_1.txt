i am a big movie fan  i like movies of all types  this is arguably the worst movie i ve ever seen   i get that it follows the book closely  which raises the point that not everything should be made into a movie  especially since the authenticity of the experiences in the book have been called into question more than once   these characters are not quirky  they are mentally ill  the things that happen are not funny  they are disturbing  especially considering they are supposed to be true   this movie had the feel of the royal tenenbaums  another movie i hated  only running with scissors was even more dysfunctional and less funny   i will never get those hours back  i wanted to wash my brain after watching
