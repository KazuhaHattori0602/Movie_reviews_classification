if you are under the age of   or   then you re going to really enjoy this movie  my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it  as an adult  i can t stand it  i m all up for sequels when they have a decent storyline  but this is nowhere near up to standard  please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid s film  but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much  you ll understand why  my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her   i ve given this film   out of   purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained
