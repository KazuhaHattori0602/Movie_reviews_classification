 bullfighter  was made in   but it is being released on video   years later for some reason  i wonder why  could it be  the confusing storyline  the incomprehensible dialogue said by oliver martinez  and the annoying editing  it s got to be  i think the plot was mary  michelle forbes  and jacque  oliver martinez  go on a mystical road trip  they meet a lot of wacky characters and avoid some evil ones too  the movie looks great and there is a lot of style  but there is no substance  most movies  when trying to subtle  don t call attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments  and weak special effects   don t be fooled by the cover  willem dafoe is in it for   minutes at most
