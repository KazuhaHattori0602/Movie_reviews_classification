this film is horribly acted  written  directed and produced  but it s so campy it s actually semi watchable  that s semi watchable   the storyline  what little there is  makes virtually no sense whatsoever  the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about   seconds    many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials  none of them went on to anything else that i m aware of  and of course sly stallone s even less talented brother well   \  trivia  it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont  ont   about   miles n east of toronto  i recognized many local landmarks intersections buildings  i think the drive in scene was filmed at the now demolished  oshawa drive in  just before it was torn down
