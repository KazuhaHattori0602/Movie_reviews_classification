this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen  i was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes races  what i got was nothing  the racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are  going fast  in one scene a mercedes slr goes from over   to   in like   seconds by just spinning around in circles  its just ridiculous   if you wanna see a real movie about cars  see the fast and the furious series  they may be a little cheesy  but  x better than this movie could ever hope to be  better yet just watch mischief   the best car movie ever made i think
