seriously  i ve read some of the reviews on this film  and i have to ask  were you people watching the same movie   yes  i give the set directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate   vintage los angeles  but so what    none of the characters are likable  the story seems aimless  karen black is simply not a very good actress  donald sutherland is just icky   and his character  homer simpson  makes me wish for the animated version  d oh  then you had the creepy child actor  the creepier billy barty  and so on   this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go   what the heck
