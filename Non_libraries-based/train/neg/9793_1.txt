mighty morphin power rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made  there is no plot  just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits   the special effects look like they are from the  s  the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy  and the show is just plain awful   the only thing worse than the television show are the toys  just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids   there are far better shows for your kids to watch   try giving your kids something like nickelodean  those shows actually have some intelligence behind them  unlike power rangers
