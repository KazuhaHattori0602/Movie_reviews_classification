the wicker man  i am so angry that i cannot write a proper comment about this movie   the plot was ridiculous  thinly tied together  and altogether just lame  nicolas cage shame on you  i assumed that since you were in it  that it would be at least decent  it was not   i felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor  and even if it s complete the movie was just outlandish and silly   at the end you re left mouth agape  mind befuddled and good taste offended  i have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred  people were complaining about it in small groups in the mall  four floors down from the theater near the entrance  it s that bad   i heard it compared to   glitter  american werewolf in paris and gigli  my boyfriend was so mad he wouldn t even talk about it   grrrr
