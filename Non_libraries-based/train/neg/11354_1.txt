i  also having endured hundreds of children s movies in the past  consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seen     i resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not  the bad guys  also  that mocking russian names like  poopchev  is inappropriate     the grandfather fly s birthday party scene contained a quasi sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone  two other flies also needlessly use the word  crap  twice     the whole movie largely smacks of  s stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we  as a nation  were proud to have risen above   in all it s just crude  badly animated  even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
