  acting  not great but some good acting     director  makes some stupid decisions for this film     writer  story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws     overall score for this movie   don t waste your time with this film  it s not worth it  i gave   for this movie and it may be too much  characters are so over exaggerated than they can ever be in real life and some pretty unexplainable stuff happens  storywise  not in good way  because of the style this film has been filmed you get bored after   minutes  too many special effects  slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards  it s always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth but there s too many tracks in this one  in the first hour there is almost   dialogs and musics
