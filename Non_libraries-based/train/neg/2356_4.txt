the film was made in   and with world war   around  the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around   the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of eleanor powell  the late miss powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word  she is again paired with a very young looking red skelton here  the two of them also starred in  i dood it   moroni olsen  who   years later  was superb as the interrogating police officer in  mildred pierce  again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item  trouble is that olsen and his rogues are really the japanese spies   bert lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o brien
