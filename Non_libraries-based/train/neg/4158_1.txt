this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen    i can honestly say i have never seen a movie worse than this one   and i mean never   i m a big fan of  b  horror movies  as you may imagine  i ve been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer   i was lured to this movie by it s title  i mean c mon  what true fan of horror wouldn t be intrigued by a title like  vampires vs  zombies  images of the  undead  battling each other to the  undeath  danced in my head  i thought to myself   this i ve got to see   well  sorry to say   this i wish i hadn t seen   this movies title is very misleading to say the least  there was no vampires fighting zombies  in fact  there is no plot  if you were to ask me what this movie is all about i could honestly tell you i have no idea   there was no plot    there was no story    this movie absolutely makes no sense at all   at the end of this debacle  i found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business sense
