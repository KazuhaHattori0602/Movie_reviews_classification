after watching about half of this i was ready to give up and turn it off  but i endured to the end  this is a movie that tries to be a romantic comedy and fails  the acting is poor much worse than the acting in  s t a movies   there are several attempts at humour that fail miserably and the movie is   predictable  perhaps if you are a teenager this movie will hold some appeal  but for those that have seen many movies  you will know how the film turns out after the first   minutes  the rest of your time will be spent in agony waiting for the ending credits to roll   don t waste your time watching this
