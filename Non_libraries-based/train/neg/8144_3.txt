i just saw this at the   vancouver international film festival  the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out  i m sorry to say i was very disappointed   besides being poorly written  it was boring  i won t take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script   first bite was clich  without being ironic  over the top seriousness without being funny  the movie would have been better had hunt hoe went with a campy horror feel  instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film  i can t recommend this film  it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
