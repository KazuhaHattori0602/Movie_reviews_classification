i ve seen this movie today for the first time and i never heard of it before  probably because of it s poor message    first of all  the directing itself is quite good  the actors played well and the cgi  i m not a fan of cgi  is magnificent  but that alone doesn t make a movie  no story at all  no message behind beautiful exploited talents   or do i have to make people remember  the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story  and this is what s missing the whole   minutes   there for a simple   rating
