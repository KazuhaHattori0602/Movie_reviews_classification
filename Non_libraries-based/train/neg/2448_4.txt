the premise and subject about making a criminal realize what his victims went through by capturing his family hostage sounds promising and interesting  but this is the only interesting part which was also dealt   years ago with quite finesse by director ravi tandon in his film  jawab  too  the problem here is ace director rajkumar santoshi found himself in some sort of confusion as to whether to make it a fast paced action thriller  viz  khakee  or an emotions rich heavy duty drama  viz  damini  and this confusion is quite evident in the final outcome  if we ignore two of his pukar   and lajja  this brilliant director has always given us fairly engrossing films with high entertainment value  therefore this film comes as a surprise  as to what made this script  sensitive director going for half baked characterization of both of his protagonists amitabh bachchan and aryeman  as the film is getting over  audience didn t know whom to hate and whom to sympathize with and this factor is the major limiting force in the complete narration  therefore what starts as a war between a common man and an underworld don ends on a strange note of self realization and regret by the don about what went wrong with his own family  the revelation of don s son as a real baddie does not come as a surprise element in the climax which if compared to similar situation in  khakee  worked so effectively with aishwarya s character  that is not all  there is more to it  the whole dramatization of life of an underworld don  operating from abroad looks quite illogical  his openly landing up at mumbai from where he is suppose to be absconding as well as running after his enemies and shooting them himself does not look believable  pitching a mediocre  newcomer actor like aryeman opposite mr  bachchan is again not a good idea  but nonetheless film has some plus points  ashok mehta s fine camera work  two good fight sequences  co ordinator abbas ali moughal  some light well acted scenes of akshay kumar in the ist half  santoshi s fast paced slick treatment and of course mr  bachchan as usual trying hard to put some life into his lifeless character  but all these put together does not make this viewing an exciting experience for you and your family
