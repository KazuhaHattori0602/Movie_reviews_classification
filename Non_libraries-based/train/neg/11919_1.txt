this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is   times better than the movie itself i first saw the trailer in   it looked great since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it until today  yes    years later   lets just say i was so disappointed its unreal  ok i knew it wouldn t be an oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no brain film in the bloodsport mold  unfortunately it was not  it s pooh  whats with all the american rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening   the fight scenes were rubbish and look fake   this dvd only cost me   and i believe i was overcharged by    now i m sad as i know that i will never get that hour and a half back
