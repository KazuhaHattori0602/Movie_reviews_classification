i happen to be the director s nephew  it s taken me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and i can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst movies of all time  my uncle doesn t even have a copy of it anymore  i asked  i m looking forward to bringing him a copy   currently the film s average rating is   as far as i can tell  that should put it somewhere in the mid s in the imdb  bottom   however with only   votes  it hasn t yet placed   it s sad that the film doesn t even get the respect of a bottom   title   anyhow  i m giving copies of the movie to family members this year for holiday gifts  best worst gift ever
