i watched this movie as i liked the plot  a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they re connected   the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first  and best  saw movie   although there wasn t much action the story moved at a relatively good pace   there was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering  alpha males  and it was a welcome surprise  for me anyway to see melissa joan hart hasn t given up on acting yet   a few things let it down for me personally    the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies     mjh s line about her cop ex  getting her into this  when in reality  he was the least deserving person to be there  he hadn t knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture     the ending  what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on  there was no resolution  no cliff hanger  no obvious end  it just ends   and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating  the first   points i would let slide but not the end
