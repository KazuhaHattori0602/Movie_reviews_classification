brilliant actor as he is  al pacino completely derails revolution   his method acting approach is totally ill suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the american war of independence  much of the blame should be attributed to director hugh hudson  yes  the man who made chariots of fire just a couple of years earlier   talk about a come down  one of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors  coaxing believable performances from them  but in this case hudson has allowed pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind  it s not just al s career low performance that hinders the film though  there are numerous other flaws with revolution  more of which will be said later   illiterate trapper tom dobb  al pacino  lives in the north eastern region of america with his son ned  sid owen dexter fletcher  he leads a simple life   living off the land  raising his son  surviving against the elements  the country is lorded over by the english colonialists  but during an eight year period   a revolution takes place which ends with the british being defeated and the independent american nation being born  dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the continental army   swept away by events they can barely understand  the dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another  tom also falls in love with daisy mcconnahay  natassja kinski  a beautiful and fiery woman of british aristocratic ancestry  their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting   where to start with the film s flaws  most key actors are miscast   pacino has been criticised enough already  but kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while donald sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless english soldier with a wobbly yorkshire accent  robert dillon s script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level  at no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the american revolution as a backdrop  or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along  as a result  the narrative falls into no man s land  flitting from  grand spectacle  to  small story  indiscriminately and meaninglessly  john corigliano s score is quite ghastly  and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety  hugh hudson s direction is clumsy throughout  both in his mismanagement of pacino and the other key actors  and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences  the idea of the hand held camera is to create immediacy   that feeling of  being there  in the confusion of battle and musket fire  like so many other things in the film  it doesn t work  the one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail  with costumes  sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate  but if it s period detail you re interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time  because as a rousing cinematic experience revolution doesn t even begin to make the grade  nothing more than a   mega bomb that the ailing british film industry could ill afford in the mid s
