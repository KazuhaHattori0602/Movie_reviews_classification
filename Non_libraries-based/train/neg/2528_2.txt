the van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van  in order to seduce them  the only thing this movie doesn t fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the us in the late  s  it looks like it was totally made by amateurs  it s trash  but i loved it  i have to admit i am a fan of  s trash  hope this one makes it to the imdb bottom
