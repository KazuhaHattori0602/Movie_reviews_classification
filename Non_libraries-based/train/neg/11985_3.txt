ever wanted to eat worms  here s a  documentary  to show you how  yeah the kid eats live worms  and that s about the most interesting part of the movie   this movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring  i m totally in agreement here  the movie just doesn t go anywhere unless you re fond of worm eating  this is one movie it s almost impossible to write a spoiler for because nothing much happens   now on the technical side  they should have given that kid a haircut  who s he trying to look like anyway bozo the clown  it was almost comical i almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something   and on top of that  the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry  should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming   all in all  this movie nearly put me to sleep  and my kids could only handle about   minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting   i will admit that the scenery was very impressive  and had there been a decent story to go with it  it might have made a hit   it did seem safe enough for kids to watch  the bear scenes and the  oddball  eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids  and the brief  skinny dipping  scene didn t show anything   i gave this one a very generous
