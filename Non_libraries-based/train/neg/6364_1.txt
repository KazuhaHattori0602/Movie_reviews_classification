absolute garbage  worse fight scenes than a   year old van damme movie or american ninja etc   truly dire acting  not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures   watch it just for how truly bad this film is  it may have been acceptable in the  s but this is a   movie  i don t have much love for this movie as it wasn t born in the  s   if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector  those are proper martial arts films   have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is
