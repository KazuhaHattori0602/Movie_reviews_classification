everyone does things that they later regret  things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession  things that although seem rational at the time  later reveal themselves to be engraved invitations for suffering and endless recriminations of stupidity   for some people it is signing the note for the new hummer  for others it is picking up a homicidal hitchhiker  for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world millionaires mysteriously strapped for cash   for me it was a film   d war  dragon wars in hindsight  i should have guessed how environmentally friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its stuttered and repeating title  but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact  and a naive faith stemming from the cool looking poster in the lobby  i really wanted this film to work  sadly  by the time the old man in the pawnshop explained the entire backstory  fifteen minutes into the picture  i had the sudden  sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film  and worse  i knew just how badly every point would all suck   let me be perfectly clear here  the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is   as for knowing all the twists of movie  i was wrong  in the spirit of the old godzilla films  whose scales this one is not worthy to fill  it conveniently sprouted extra sub plots every time the main characters were threatened by the specter of meaningful dialogue   it was infested with close calls  miraculous escapes  and concentrated deposits of poorly explained angst   this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty morphing power rangers access to the national defense budget  and lots of liquor   let me try to explain   imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade  first take the rasta talking army of amphibians from star wars episode one and remove their prozac until they are ready to club navy seals   next  take close approximations of kira knightly and tom cruise  you can even call him ethan as a  subtle  nod to the mission impossible franchise  and give them lots of film noir narration  so no one get confused while trying to follow the wading pool depths of their thoughts   finally add a raspy voiced villain in pointy armor worthy of a lord of the rings yardsale and a couple of giant cobras  angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong  and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angeles   now run to the drugstore to find something for your sudden migraine  when you return  puree these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is dissolved into a homogenized mass of cheese and serve semi gelatinous   at several points during this picture  i found myself saying out loud   make the bad movie stop  and breaking into tears   to call this a b movie would be giving it an undeserved promotion  after summer school  and a lot of physical therapy  it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it   in short  if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn  and the need to punish yourself for hideous  unspoken sins against humanity  dragon wars might just be the film for you
