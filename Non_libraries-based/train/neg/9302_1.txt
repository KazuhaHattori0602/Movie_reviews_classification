this movie is just horrible  it s boring  it s low quality  the actors are just the worst actors i have ever seen and the scenario is so bad that it s hilarious   the  main  actor is supposed to be the hot guy who gets all the girls  but he s ugly  overweight and looks like he s from the early  s   all the characters are away for the week end for a get together amongst friends  but nobody are actually friends  the married couple hasn t seen the  main  guy in over   years and even back then they weren t really friends  the  date  of the main guy only knows him from work and than there s a girl they pick up at a bar  now tell me that you would risk losing your job to spend a week end at your cabin with people that aren t even your real friends  because that s what he does at the beginning of the movie   do not waste even one minute of your time on this lemon  i ve made home movies scarier than this
