i waited almost   years to see this movie  thinking it might be an underrated work  from a period animation was no longer of the quality it had once been  it starred one of the best film villains of all time  was based on a beloved series of children s books  and was a disney studios production  what could possibly be wrong with it  as it turns outs  almost everything   well  not everything  vincent price as rattigan and henry mancini s swanky score are the movie s two saving graces  price is wickedly enjoyable  and mancini more professional than the material deserves  they bring class to a project that otherwise belongs in obscurity    meanwhile the rest of the movie  while filled with inappropriately adult situations  still suffers from a completely dull script  blandly generic voice work  terrible songs  and lazy animation that wouldn t have been out of place on any of disney s mid s saturday morning tv shows   this was a complete disappointment to me  it s amazing that this movie was nearly contemporary with the secret of nimh  costing a fraction of this  an independent studio produced something with more creativity in its trailer than gmd has in its endless running time   the extra star that keeps this from being  awful  goes to price and mancini
