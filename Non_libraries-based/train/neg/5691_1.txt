consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll  somewhere  perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said  you don t talk about at parties  boll knows that david lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him  gore whores  metal heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the teutonic helmsman s output so bereft of originality  wit or imagination that he s become the internet s bogeyman   an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement  boll does his best to ride over these naysayers  exploiting tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers  the difference being that mostel s character knew he was making bowel fill  maybe uwe knows it too   such is the level of hostility toward each new  bollbuster  that imdb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting   before they ve seen it  boll s attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined  indeed he s probably the only filmmaker that s boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage   this onslaught has made uwe a very thick skinned man  so much so that he must feel like he s wrapped in a carpet  but one who feels as if he s bullied by the entire world  like most people in that situation he lashes out  determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding variety s review of house of the dead  never too far from the surface  this  i know you are but what am i  strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of postal  which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about   christian fundamentalism  jihad  nazism and paedophilia  such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their surname   in seed  shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation  boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer  is there any other kind  who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life  mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after   attempts must go free  though if you d been fried with that much electricity why would you want to  they pronounce him legally dead and bury him  only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers   boll begins his  exploration of nihilistic rage  with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes  from there we re treated to the killer s stock in trade   kidnapping dogs  babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food  we re invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are   our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition  yes  we re worthless  gormless sadists and worse than that  we won t give uwe a good rating on the imdb  in short  humanity is bunk   of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it s a bit of a bipolar piece  on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness   the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long  while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth   the result says nothing about society and its discontents  more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director  poor uwe is obviously a very angry man   one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair  no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy s about dispatching various web critics  that it s there but takes an avant garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread  shows that boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements  he s made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate   i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun  boll told the audience at the film s world premiere and he has  on that flimsy manifesto  succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director s detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker  he ll need something genuine to say as well as a better  more original way of saying it
