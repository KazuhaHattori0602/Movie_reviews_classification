the choke  aka axe in the uk  is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight to dvd movie  i say  supposedly  because the title of the movie does not have the  v  in brackets to indicate that it was a made for dvd movie  even though it does have the appearance of one   the plot is simple   a band is holding a gig in a former meatpacking factory and they are killed one by one   i think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece  but this does not excuse the faults here  even straight to dvd movies such as bachelor party massacre  which has a very low imdb rating  have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so called  so bad  they re good  movies  however  the choke falls far short of being either a serious slasher  such as halloween  or being a  so bad it s good  movie  such as the nail gun massacre   the movie does start off good with a character killed using a drill  the blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget  but  from there onwards  it s downhill all the way   there are so many faults in the choke that i could spend all day talking about them  but  a few obvious ones stand out and i ll go into them   the aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around   people present but after the music stops  there seems to be only around   people left  and yet they re all meant to be locked in   the characters in this movie are not likable at all  most of the band members are aggressive foul mouthed morons or just downright weird  no one really cares about what happens to them  and even their supposed friends forget about them when they ve been dispatched  the highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meatpacking factory as some kind of church  seriously  he spouts some really funny lines for no apparent reason  but sadly  even his presence can t save the movie   there are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation  around   minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking  characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation  as in other straight to dvd movies such as crocodile and grim weekend  the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other aggressively without any provocation at all  there are plenty of over the top outbursts  mainly from the male characters  and one nearly results in a full blown fight  in fact  the format could be said to go as follows  characters walk around murder takes place characters walk around murder takes place  you get the idea   the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f word being used  perhaps this was meant to be funny  but it just comes off as sad  and more to the point  we have all seen this done a thousand times before  usually to much greater effect   the movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all  the dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger  a maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons  they make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves  and much of the time  they don t even pretend to be scared   in the same vein as drive in massacre  the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed  with the exception of the final murder when the killer s identity is revealed  a random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question  there is no one seen stalking the characters at any time  in drive in massacre  this served to make the film funny  unintentionally of course  but here it is not funny at all   and  as another reviewer has pointed out  the soundtrack includes music that is very bad  even for those who like punk rock  the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it  the score  at the end  there is no music at the beginning  consists of a band of sugarbabe wannabes singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie   don t misunderstand the points made in this review  this reviewer likes bad movies  such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor party massacre  as much as the classics  such as halloween and friday the  th  but  it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either  and even as straight to dvd movies go  this is a poor effort   on a positive note  the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes  but  when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously  these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion   fans of the traditional  s b movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie  and fans of the classics such as halloween and friday the  th should do everything in their power to avoid it
