bizarre take on the cinderella tale  terribly poor script  but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance   visually stunning in some parts  but that s about it  the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the  s  fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full   minutes of drivel   if you re really in the mood for a cinderella story   i suggest  ever after  a cinderella story  or  the glass slipper
