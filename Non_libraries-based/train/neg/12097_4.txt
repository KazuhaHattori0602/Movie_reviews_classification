i wasn t really hoping for much when i went to see this  after mst king the heck out of jasonx with some friends though  i was hoping for a similar experience here   unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously  do i care about jason s problems  i m sorry no  there are a legion ft th movies that cover that anyway  at at then end of the day  he s an undead serial killer  i m just not going to get that sympathetic   freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not  but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie  it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch only not funny
