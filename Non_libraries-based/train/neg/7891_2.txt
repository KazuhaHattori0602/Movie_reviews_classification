the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film  it should have read  be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the  rd pew from the back of your family s church at   years old  listening to the preacher drone on about god s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego   it starts off well intentioned  building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny s  how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast  moment  it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree  sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble  i believe i counted the use of the word  pray  about   times in a five minute span near the end  after the  st  i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym   prey  sadly  this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last   minutes  plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say  prayer   preyer  to me  as it became totally zany  indeed  even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom  almost to the point of ending up on the floor   for all the salivating christians who ranked this film   stars  i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square  the ten commandments  anything from narnia  jesus christ superstar and the like  stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp  the god who wasn t there  what would jesus buy  or the soon to be released religulous   maybe robert whitlow s book is better
