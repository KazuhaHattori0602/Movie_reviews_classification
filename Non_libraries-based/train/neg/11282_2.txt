in the wake of lock  stock and two smoking barrels  the british film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late  s early  s that seem even more desperate today than they did then  in one of the all time great cases of pearls from swine  the producers of rancid aluminium brazenly plastered the quote  the best film of the century  from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because  at the time of writing  it was the only film that had been released in   looking at it today it s hard to imagine how it ever got made  uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of cool britannia s lads mags brigade   rhys ifans  sadie frost  nick moran and joseph fiennes   but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused james hawes novel  that the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no one really knows what it is  or perhaps simply don t think it matters  something to do with ifans  businessman being set up with steven berkoff s homicidal russian crime lord in a money laundering or investment scheme  it s never clear which because no one ever asks  by fiennes  crooked irish accountant  who expects the russians to kill off ifans so he can take over his failing company  things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on  ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and tara fitzgerald s ludicrously accented russian temptress  berkoff keeps on saying  bizniss  and  francis drake  and fiennes does a decent irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in shakespeare in love doesn t mean he s any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts   when the most convincing performances come from keith allen and dani behr  you know a film is in deep trouble  with poland standing in for a russia filled with people with polish accents and a strange score that veers from john barry pastiche to lounge music to ennio morricone spaghetti western on a stylophone budget  it fails completely in the cool stakes it s aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own  sitting there like a joke shop dog turd
