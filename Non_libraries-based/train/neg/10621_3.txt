i won t add to the plot reviews  it s not very good   very improbable orphanage on bala   cushing and lee at their height   some nice scenery   good for face spotting  and i quote   look at the mouth  that is cassie from fools and horses   otherwise  a poor example of the british film industry   fulton mackay was far better in fraggle rock  keith barron was better in anything else and diana dors did what she did best   redeeming feature  it was free to watch on the horror channel prior to its going over to subscription  i won t be subscribing on this effort
