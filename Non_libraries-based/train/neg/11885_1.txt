i ll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona  because quite frankly  to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth  is just an insult to any such director  i will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire `office space  in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe  i can  however  compare it to waking up during your own surgery   it s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they re doing  haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production  it was cruel to let it live and as a result  audiences around the world are being made to suffer   the film s premise   if indeed it has one   is not even worth discussing  but for the sake of caution i will  josh kornbluth  a temp worker with severe commitment phobia  is offered a permanent job  his main duty is to mail out   high priority letters for his boss  but ludicrously  he is unable to perform this simple task  my reaction  big deal  that s not a story
 it s a passing thought at best   one that should ve passed any self respecting filmmaker by    the leading actor   if you can call him that   is a clumsy buffoon of a man  with chubby features  a receding  untamed hairline  and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing  where o where did the director find this schmuck  what s that you say

 he is the director  oh  my mistake  playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing  but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn t that convincing as a human being  let alone an actor  rest assured  this is by no means an aimless character assassination  but never before have i been so riled up by an actor s on screen presence  my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to camera monologues in between scenes  i mean  as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel  kornbluth insults us further by `explaining  the action  first rule of filmmaking  `dramatize exposition 
 show  don t tell  who does this guy think he is  he has no charisma  no charm  and judging by his hawaiian shirts  no sense of style  his casting agent should be shot point blank   the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt  with but one exception  patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex secretary  who has been driven insane by her old boss  and makes harassing phone calls from her basement  while holding a flashlight under her face  this did make me chuckle to myself  but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film   the film s title is also a misnomer  haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry  don t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office


 there s a very good reason for that
