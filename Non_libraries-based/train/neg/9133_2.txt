this is strictly a review of the pilot episode as it appears on dvd   television moved out of my life in   so i never followed the series or any part of it   which means that i m immune to the nostalgic charm that moonlighting appears to have for most reviewers     possible spoiler warning    the pilot of moonlighting is your basic  caveman meets fluffball  yarn  where a  charming  red blooded he man manipulates a misguided woman into realizing what she really wants and needs  the premises that the script s  wit  is based on must have already felt stale around   it also contains some frankly bad writing  as in the scene where maddie demolishes the furnishings instead of shooting the villain  strictly in order to prove herself the inept female in need of masculine assistance    i often feel that susan faludi overreacts in seeing male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment  but in this particular case i m all with her   moonlighting has backlash stamped all over it    in one sense  however  this dvd is a must for all serious bruce willis fans  in addition to the pilot episode  it contains the screen test that landed willis the job  both features show to what amazing extent willis  acting ability developed between   and    die hard   in country  impressive    rating  and i _am_ a bruce willis fan    out of
