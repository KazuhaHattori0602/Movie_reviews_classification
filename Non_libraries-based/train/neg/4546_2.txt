i have just seen this movie and have not read the book  the good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject  evolution  sincronicity and your part in the world   however  the movie s immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters  it is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version  the events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable  a lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence  and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose    enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to  do you recall the enlightenment with keanu reeves  in little buddha    well  this is nothing like that   most scenes are poorly executed  there are a lot of scenes that really don t develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere   the better actors in this movie  namely hector elizondo  joaquim de almeida and j rgen prochnow cannot save it  the first   seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie  and because they were paid more  but this does not work  most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all   j rgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy  as always  but the script does not help him at all  the scene where he first tries to convince john  matthew settle  to join him is just bad script  the execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed  the flashbacks throughout the movie cannot even be commented   overall this movie is a big waist of time  read the book  i have not read it  but it is probably a billion times better than this  it has to be   it is so bad that i had to write my first comment in imdb
