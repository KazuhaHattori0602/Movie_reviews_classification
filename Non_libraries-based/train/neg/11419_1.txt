i think i ve seen this sort of thing before  college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good  all the while  complaining that their lives suck   this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it  they practically have the same plot   if anything good came out of this snore fest  it was the music  that was it   as far as i m concerned  i m not impressed  but then again  i never expected anything less  this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin  another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow   now for the verdict  it s a   out of
