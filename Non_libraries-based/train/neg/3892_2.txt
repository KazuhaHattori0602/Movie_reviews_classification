want to watch a scary horror film  then steer clear of this one  there s not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable   however  there is enough scotch  single malt  if you can manage it   if the previous comments weren t enough to keep you from watching this film sober  allow me to assist  nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn  a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose  things go downhill from there  and wackiness ensues   i actually read the book adaptation  which was published and released only in the uk  miles better than the film  and the book was dreadful  at least some pretense is made towards suspense  and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author s  rhymes with  gas   not to say that the film is completely without merit  rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film  and jonathan demme found that he s really better suited to direct   yes  there is an mst k episode featuring this flick  but it is  of course  edited quite a bit  without the obligatory flashing of the breasts  not even the healing power of scotch can save you   please  just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt  see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts  i can not  in all good conscience  recommend this film to the sober film going public
