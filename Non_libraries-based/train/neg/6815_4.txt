the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest  the intriguing plot  such as it is  seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim   minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along  a would be female vampire  scantily clad  as promised by the title  is held in captivity inside a remote ch teau and emerges only to  feast  on the blood of willing victims  who are apparently members of a suicide club  as if unsure where all of this would lead him  the writer director ultimately has the human villain   actually the blank faced hero s kinky father   ludicrously revealed as a mutant  from the future  the languorous pace and dream like atmosphere  the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl  are  of course  typical of both the film maker  ditto the seashore setting at the  anti climax  and the  euro cult  style  as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display  personally  the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson  who appeared in six latter day luis bunuel films  crop up bemusedly through it from time to time
