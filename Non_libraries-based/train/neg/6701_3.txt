i have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show  i had it set to record all episodes because i thought i could really learn some great new things  i probably could if i could get past rachelle   i m sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer  it doesn t work for someone who s really interested in improving the planet   this show should be called nagging with rachelle   since ed is such a great font of information  maybe a second show that s really serious about the environment would be a good idea  dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us    i no longer record episodes or watch the show  but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works
