what in god s name happened here  how does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of redneck zombies  was zombie   ever supposed to entertain someone  anyone  or even make a dollars profit  but mainly  what happened here    zombie   extreme pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of andreas schnaas  who specializes in earth shattering gore films  such as goblet of gore  and anthropophagus   and some of which contain profanity in the titles  in the gore department  this one isn t much different than the rest  although  the level of ineptness  well  earth shattering   zombie   extreme pestilence is as bad as peter jackson s dead alive is gory  think about it   getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time  an accident  involving chemicals causes the dead to come back  and eat the living  never has the concept been treated in such a manner  the gore effects are a whole  new low  just a z grade nightmare  i can t tell whether  or not this was originally meant to be funny  somehow  i doubt the english dubbing was being very true to the original script  but stranger things have happened  the whole thing just reminds me of a shot on video introduction to a troma movie  except it lasts a hell of a lot longer   i ve seen only one film that was worse than this  the chooper   for proof that andreas schnaas is an actual director  i would highly recommend nikos the impaler if you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie  give extreme pestilence a try  but you ve been warned  it takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through  but if gore is all you re here for  then you might be able to stomach this one  other than that  no atmosphere  no  and i mean no budget  no entertainment value  but mostly  no pride  show some pride  schnaas      updated   after a few more viewings of zombie   i ve had a change of heart  or i guess i just get it now  zombie   is hilarious  so nevermind the harsh words  although  extreme pestilence still only deserves one star
