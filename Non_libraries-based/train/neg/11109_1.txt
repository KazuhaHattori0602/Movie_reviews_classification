i am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this  i haven t seen such a bad movie for years omg this was a really bad movie  splatter  is not enough to describe the unnecessary  nearly funny  blood scenes  if you didn t like hostel  or wolf creek or halloween    well this is   time worse  the story remind me rl stine goosebumps   i can t tell about the acting since the script was so terrible clich  all the time   why i must write  lines  i never understood this    here comes spoilers   the story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro  we are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice  actually those people are just missing  and there is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery  well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy  and as usual no one believes him  what a surprise  in the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher
