my score for this crap          for the technical only  everything else is very bad    another film that makes no sense  clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission    while it s easy to understand why politicians never say the truth  they are among the biggest liars on the planet  it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic    we must believe that taking people for morons  perhaps it was reason to believe  since   of the films are crap  because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios    when you look at the price we give oscars  we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others    and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense  but it was not for education and health    if you still want to listen to this s t  press super fast forward button  at least  x
