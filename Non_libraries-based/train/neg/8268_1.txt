this movie is horrible  everything in it has been done before  there is nothing original  i cannot stand when writers don t come up with their own plots   a girl makes a wish on her  th birthday and wakes up as an adult  hmm  sounds a lot like a movie in the  s called big  what is even more annoying is jennifer garner s acting  she doesn t act like she is   she just acts like she is stupid   from then on  you can guess the whole plot  she gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at   works with her  wow  how awesome  but  no her friend is bad and turns on her  trying to get her job  but  of course  she wins in the end when she comes up with a  great  idea   there s also a dancing scene in the movie that i ve seen a thousand times before   i hate this movie
