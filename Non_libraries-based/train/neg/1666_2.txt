can any movie become more naive than this  you cant believe a piece of this script  and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first   minutes  the leading actress seems like she wants to be barbie  but she doesn t make it  the doll has more acting skills   the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography  i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the one good thing of the film is madsen s performance which manages to bring life to a melo like one dimensional character   the movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth  i can think some   year old britney obsessed girls shouting  o  do give us a break  if we want fairy tales there is always the brothers grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic  i gave it   instead of one only for virginia madsen
