one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties  pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga  the sure thing  the fly   her character dies fairly early on  and the rest of the film is totally forgettable   during their christmas break  a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture  a crazy killer  however  throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways   exploiting every stalk  n  slash clich  in the book  director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed  so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile  the majority of the deaths  which  let s face it  is why we generally watch this kind of film  are brief and not that gory  the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor  there is one notably bloody dismembered corpse the film could ve done with more   at the last minute  the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending  but this really is one for slasher completists only
