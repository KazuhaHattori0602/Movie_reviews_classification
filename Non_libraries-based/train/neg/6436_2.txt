i am a kind person  so i gave this movie a   instead of a   it was without a doubt the worst movie that i ve seen in a long time  there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i e  what jesus may really have wanted us to know  were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine  arquette  total crucifixion in the first   minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience  the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired  and  if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera  i may have started screaming louder than patricia
