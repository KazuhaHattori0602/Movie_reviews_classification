i ll get to the movie in a minute  first  someone wanted  proof  about clinton s comments at georgetown  where he claimed that the usa  deserved  the   attacks  well  here s what clinton said    in the first crusade  when the christian soldiers took jerusalem  they first burned a synagogue with   jews in it and proceeded to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple mount  i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it   we re still paying for it  whaddya mean  we  paleface  the marines didn t storm the temple mount    but in truth  clinton never really came out and flatly said that we  deserved    like all his statements during his presidency  he implied that we deserved   just point out  fact  a  b  c  and maybe d  and let the listener deduce that they must add up to conclusion x  when in truth  most of clinton s  facts  added up to guacamole   but that s beside the point  we re here to talk movies  not politics  unfortunately  when oliver  captain conspiracy  stone does a movie  you can t escape his warped politics  it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and bitterness on the reagan era  and what better time than when stone s dreams almost came true  on the day reagan nearly bought the farm  unable to find any nefarious plots or schemes in hinckley s assassination attempt  he invents one with al haig  from a simple misunderstanding of the chain of constitutional authority  haig is transformed from a public servant who really should have brushed up on his remedial civics into a raving megalomaniac  you almost expect haig to rub his hands together like montgomery burns and tell cap weinberger to  release the hounds  stone even recruits the smarmiest person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state  richard dreyfuss  a guy you love to hate on sight   overall  the movie is ok  average  hovering on below average  don t bother renting or buying  try to catch it on cable    out of
