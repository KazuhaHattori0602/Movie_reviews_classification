dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double bill circuit  the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border  there were great expectations for this back in     a script co written by the wild bunch s walon green  jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast  harvey keitel  warren oates  valerie perrine  tony richardson directing  although he was pretty much a spent force by then    but now it doesn t even turn up on tv  the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the  s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption  with nicholson s border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife s relentless materialism  until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business  unfortunately  he never really gets his hands dirty  barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface  the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and  sadly  the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original  nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film s trailers   while that probably wasn t too convincing considering how low key nicholson s crisis of conscience is in the film  it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity  at one point he s holding characters at gunpoint  then he s somewhere else and they re free trying to kill him  one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrine s character gets dumber on an exponential level  the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease  and one impressive car stunt  in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely  what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring  unfortunately ry cooder s beautiful title song  across the borderline  says it all much more economically  but if you want to know the film s real crime  it s completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part  when even he can t make an impression  you know something s really wrong  all in all  all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time
