after we counted the use of the f word  oh  about   times in the first   minutes or so of the film  listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse  and pretty much acting like   year old boys being naughty together  well  we turned it off  relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser hollywood movie  the product of unimaginative and no talent writers    we did give it a second chance  thinking surely it would get better  no dice  later  my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved  still no dice   the main character did have a cool bike   i wouldn t recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents  or frat boys
