that this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days   first of all  there is such a thing as the art of cinematography  just picking up a  mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie   i guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director didn t pick up someone s camcorder   second  indie films are supposed to be about real people  there s nothing real in this film  none of the characters come across as being even remotely human   what they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how  cool and edgy  he is   sorry  but this is not good writing  or good directing   what is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to sundance  hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted   in any case  it made me loose what was left of my respect for the sundance brand
