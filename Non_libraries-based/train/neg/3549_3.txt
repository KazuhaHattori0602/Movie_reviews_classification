do you like stand up  then stay away from this   during the early rounds  there are in fact good comics  but unless they got some cute qualities  they got a snowballs chance  any controversial material and you are out   and i think i hurt as much as the discarded comedians  when i see who the crooked judges are letting in     out of my top   made it further than the preliminaries  half  of the finalists have given me   laughs  several of them have lifted their material elsewhere  something the judges doesn t seem to have problems with   it is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on tv  but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what it could have been   if the producers changed the name of the contest to  last clown standing  all my criticism would loose validity  maybe an idea
