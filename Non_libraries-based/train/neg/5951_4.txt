written by the excellent mcgovern and directed by frears this film was a slight disappointment  it seemed too short  it spent far too long creating the hovis atmosphere  and laughing at the catholic demands  then very quickly you have the fascist and socialists vying for the family s attention  and the terrible conclusion   still my wife thought liam was cute
