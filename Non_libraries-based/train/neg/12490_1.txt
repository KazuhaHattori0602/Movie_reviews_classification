i own this movie  i bought it for   at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some  indie  type movie research since i had just finished my own feature and was editing it  now when i feel down about my skills as a first time director i just sit down with a plate of cookies and severed  within minutes i feel great   i hate to down talk another filmmaker so i ll just use constructive criticism    find good actors  take the time  it really helps    when shooting video  over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post    closeups are better for video    when an actor enters a scene  wait a bit before  having them speak so that we know what s going on and who s talking    never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it  damn well worth the    the true horror would be getting the reviews severed has here on imdb  and you have to give these guys credit  they did get distributed
