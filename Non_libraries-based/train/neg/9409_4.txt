i liked this show  i think it was nothing with wrong with it  only that spidey don t punch anyone but only for that the show doesn t suck  some people only think this show is bad because of that  the story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like x men  the punisher  daredevil and iron man  to bad sandman never appear but i kinda like it  best spidey show ever  my favorite episodes are    turning point   spider wars   the hobgoblin   the alien costume   mutant agenda  but there are some episodes that was really really bad like  rocket racer and the spot which was embarrassing to watch  and i don t like morbius and hydro man  first of morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don t like vampires  and it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in season   of course i have to mentioned hydro man  he was terrible  i rather see sandman  his last appearance was so terrible  and i don t like spidey as the man spider   but i guess everything than this was bad
