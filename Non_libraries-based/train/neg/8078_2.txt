the world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart  yes  it s solar crisis  aka crisis   which burned up a huge chunk of change that s never apparent on screen back in   and returned barely enough to buy a happy meal for each of the cast in japan before going straight to video  remember them  in a re edited version credited to one alan smithee  the plot hook s pretty much the same as sunshine   suicide mission to the sun  saboteur on board  logic cast adrift   except that this time they re not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach earth  with a talking bomb  voiced by paul williams  who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously
 given that the cast also includes jack palance at his most dementedly ott  charlton heston at his most rigid  top liner tim matheson at his most anonymous  the original hills have eyes  unforgettable michael berryman  you may not remember the name  but you do remember that face  and peter boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because  er  if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down  you d expect if not a laugh a minute at least a laugh every reel  no joy  this is the worst kind of bad movie  a boring one  the fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace  there s low key and there s walking through it  but here the cast don t even do that  instead  they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time  you keep on hoping for paul williams  talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis  but instead the film just  stands there  doing next to nothing  literally  this is one of the most inert movies ever made   so inert that if clive owen had been cast  he d almost have looked lively by comparison  even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves  yep  the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness  even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by
 standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world  merchant ivory films have better action scenes   things aren t much livelier down on earth where the movie spends most of it s running time with matheson s son chuck s grandson corin nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with palance s insane desert artist  looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me  while waylaid by rejects from a mad max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can
 release him on a nice beach  just don t expect logic  if you haven t already guessed that much  best moment  a ditzy girl in a bar describing jack palance as  an old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather  though chucky baby taking out the villain s aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for   of it s running time offers a whole lot of nuttin  richard c  sarafian s slightly longer original cut that played in japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable   minutes  the director of vanishing point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film  a film so bad it s not good  and painfully unfunny with it
