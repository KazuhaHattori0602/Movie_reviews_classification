my title just about sums this heap of crap up i should have taken a hint when i saw it was a fred olen ray movie   but i thought  hey  it might be better than his usual rubbish  boy  was i wrong  this has to be the worst movie ever targeted at children  the acting was awful  the humour was non existent  the direction was the worst i have ever seen   the special effects wouldn t seem out of place on a  s disney movie   what has happened to dee wallace stone  who once had such a promising career in the  s  movie veteran   former child actor russ tamblyn was a awful bad guy   the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie   i haven t seen the sequel made in   and nor do i intend to  if you want a good kid movie watch  honey i shrunk blew up the kids kid  or any disney movie  my rating as a   yo      rating as a kid movie     at the best
