 aka  blood castle or scream of the demon    spoiler   this was a drive in feature  co billed with the velvet vampire  a spanish italian co production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named yanos dalmar is seen on horseback  riding off with his  man eating  dog behind him   the townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down  the murders first began around the time count yanos  older brother  count igor dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident   then a woman ivanna  erna schuer  that igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up  yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells  yanos wants to bring igor s charred corpse back to life   but of course igor is still alive  although horribly burned  and stalking and killing the women in the village  we see his char broiled face appear at various points in the film  so we know he s still alive  making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious   igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with yanos over ivanna  with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that igor stumbles on to  meeting yet another  final char broiled end   the retromedia dvd is taken from a vhs source and looks quite grainy and bad  other than an even scratchier trailer  no other extras are included  although it has a nice  creepy spanish castle and good atmospherics  i found it to be fairly boring and predictable  with no excitement or mystery  whatsoever      out of
