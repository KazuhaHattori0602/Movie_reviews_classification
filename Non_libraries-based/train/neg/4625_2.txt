how could   out of   prior voters give this movie a   how could more than half the prior voters give it a   or higher  who is voting here  i can only assume it is primarily kids   very young kids  the fact is that this is a bad movie in every way  the story is stupid  the acting is hard to even think of as acting  the characters are characterless  and the dialogue is terrible  i saw this one rainy afternoon on the sci fi channel  in the sad event that it is ever rebroadcast  i suggest you read a book instead
