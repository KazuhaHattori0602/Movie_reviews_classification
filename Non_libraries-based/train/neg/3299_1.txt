this must be one of the worst movies i have ever seen  i was actually expecting a bad movie but i was caught by surprise believe it or not  the storyline is the traditional  all clich es are included   the dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half descent actors are trying to make it sound real  the photo is not too good  the music is so malplac e it actually made me angry  the actors are not even trying  altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for   years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the  action  itself   i dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming  who is financing this shit  where is the screening   and why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script   there are a million hollywood movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters  but even them straight to video things actually manages to look professional in comparison   i can not say anything positive about this except the title which explains it all  i feel robbed of   hours of my life
