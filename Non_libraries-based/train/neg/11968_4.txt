this is just typical bruce willis  action movie schtick  watch it with some popcorn and your buddies  rent it  to save money   none of it is realistic  the battles aren t realistic  the soldiers aren t realistic  the victims aren t realistic  and why was tom skerritt s character talking to willis from the deck of the carrier  what s up with that  he can t do that from inside the ship   of course  bruce w  gets a machete wound  there s a bunch of average explosions   if this movie accurately represents the navy seals  then don t get stuck in africa expecting them to come rescue you   the noble attack on the village bothered me the most   front row seats to an ethnic cleansing as bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town  so what does he do  he crawls into town on his belly  yep  how many died while they were putzing around  oh well a body count was needed  i guess   and if that one african guy was so important  why didn t he get on the chopper with the elderly and children  can he say  duh    finally  the movie was very dark  not just in plot  but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on   rent it
