after a promising first   minutes that makes you feel all warm inside  you re pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy  then the movie takes a turn for the worse    the warm feeling might still be there  but as others has said  the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it s almost unbearable to watch    the movie gets sped up  and you get the impression that you re either fast forwarding through it  or that the producers decided to fit it in less than  h m and had to cut a lot of scenes out   realism isn t a goal onto itself  but as a viewer  i m pretty convinced that this comedy isn t intentionally unrealistic  it just happens to be   on the plus side  this movie has a couple of nice interiors  and despite the bad script  i think that the actors performances are mainly good  if i could rate the first   minutes only  i d probably give it an eight  as it is now  it gets a four   and that s being nice    if you re a sucker for romantic comedies you ll probably have a great time anyways  if not  i d recommend that you watch something else
