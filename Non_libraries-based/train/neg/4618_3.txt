oh  how we have a misfire here  a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values  character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since d w  griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as  the yellow man  characters so unimaginative and un engaging that it s difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow  stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film   prizzi s honor is a film that ends up being an absolute post modern disaster in every which way possible  the film is a messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing  kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on a phone now and again or bicker with a main character  prizzi s honor is a film that falls into a genre of neo noir  comedy  romance  action  gangster and overall crime   this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of a story  some sort of a sequence of good scenes  some sort of intelligence in the form of a screenplay or something else but no   what we get is a nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all   i ll give a couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of a film actually is  firstly  the film thinks it s a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time  of my time  charley partanna  nicholson  is an assassin who kills people for a family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoo s nest more than an international hit man  he meets and falls in love with irene walker  turner  who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for a plot plays out  it appears all is not right  i read that the plot for this film is   a professional hit man and hit woman fall in love  only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other  well  yes that s true but that actual revelation doesn t happen until about twenty minutes to the end  nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of   he walks around  seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees  he talks like he is either drunk or has a more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin   one really poorly shot assassination early on  that actually happens off screen  is not enough to suggest this guy is a hard bodied  best of the best  international hit man   so with a main character who is un likable and un realistic  we move to the script  the first hour and a half is just a cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions  partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again   do i marry her  do i love her  what is love  what do i do  and it gets so repetitive  it s not even able to act as good humour  this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone  a girl called maerose prizzi  huston  played by director john s daughter  which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it   that got me thinking  was this supposed to be funny  should i be laughing  the film felt like a smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of a wedding  al  the godfather  and consequential scenes with a touch of noir as gangsters  police men and assassins were introduced into the film  but what we get is something very  very different   the second hour revolves around some sort of a kidnap plot  right  the love and romance is dealt with   maybe the film will kick start  i was so very wrong  with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in a monotone way  we have a kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office  this scene sums the film up  everything is briefly planned and then executed in a heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy  we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music  perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators  maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs   the scene isn t even edited correctly  some suspense  some drama   do i shoot or don t i  maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it s too late   anything but how it was actually executed  prizzi s honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax  it s a film where cameras reflect in windows  lights reflect in sides of cars and  dead  chauffeurs blink when nudged  prizzi s honor is a jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film goer and don t say it was a comedy because i didn t laugh with it   at it is another matter  the film is repetitive  drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality   there is no honour here
