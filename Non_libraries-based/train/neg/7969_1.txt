ok another film bought by me and joe swatman  ok this isn t the worst film i ve reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly  we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap   the monster jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas  u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun  the film wasn t as gory as we hoped  i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack  again i think the acting sucks  sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason    the absolute worst part is the ending  it leaves it open for a bit of a jigsaw   but thats never gunna happen lets face it   my ratings   funny   mock  how much fun we had mocking it    acting   generally
