i ll keep this short as a movie like this doesn t deserve a full review   given the setting  this movie could have been something really special  it could have been another   days later  or even a  blair witch project   the first   or so minutes of the movie i was really excited  directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense  although i don t think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london underground   characters were a big let down  our  heroine  in this movie is a worthless piece of crap  and you really don t care if she dies or not  as many people have said before  i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy  who managed to give me a chuckle or two whether intentional of the writers or not   the main villain  is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie  but when he is revealed i was really disappointed  i won t spoil it but lets just say my   year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match   all in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula  this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark   just to highlight how lame this movie was  the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain  instead they run away
