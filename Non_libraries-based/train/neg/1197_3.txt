they really can t get stupider than this film dealing with   losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning  the problem is that these losers try to do this   years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president   trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular  but of course she comes out of all that  the girls go through drunken rages  exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense   it really can t get much worse than this awful film
