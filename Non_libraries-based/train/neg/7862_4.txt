okay  let s not get confused here  if this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic  does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic s sequel  here s to hoping that s not a general rule  as wes craven s own sequel to the original  the hills have eyes    released somewhere during the mid s   is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made  part two didn t have an actual plot and re used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise  craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories  as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies  there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well  the remake came out barely one year ago and here s the sequel already  the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script  don t they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary  menacing and disturbing  with his excellent film  alexandre aja nearly single handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes  as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for  also  aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic  high tension  but who is this new director  aja s  the hills have eyes  was an unexpected hit  appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over enthusiast target groups  it s a really good film and  even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable  it s highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of aja s smashing hit  bearing all this in mind  plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism  i must admit this rushed sequel really isn t as awful as anticipated  the screenplay is routine and clich d horror fodder  introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive looking freaks  after the events of the first film  the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests  which took place there in the  s and  s  for the horribly mutated survivors of the miner s community that stayed there during the radioactive testing  the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck  they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines   this basically is just another by the numbers slasher with dumb characters who are  even after losing several of their friends already  still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill  it s also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive  especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute  year old son   the hills have eyes ii  completely lacks   as to be expected   originality  logic and plausible situations  the mutated miners aren t nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one  mainly because they aren t organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex hungry prototype monsters  since you don t care for the amateur g i  joe  heroes  and definitely don t feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills  this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year s original  most peculiarly  this second film isn t nearly as violent and gory as the first  sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences  but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor  there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics   mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns   but there sadly aren t any outrageous pick axe battles or virulent dog attacks  what a shame  what s the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and or gratuitous filth of the original  luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental  and you ll have the most fun spotting all the things that don t make the slightest bit of sense  for example  wallets falling out of people s bloodied heads  women without any muscle power cast as tough ass soldiers and   my personal favorite   assigning the one soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications
