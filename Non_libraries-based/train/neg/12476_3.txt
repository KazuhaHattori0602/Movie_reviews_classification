wha bam  someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture  writer howard cohen expands the  sword   sorcery  concept with a couple of extra s s  like sex  silliness   more  sex and sheer stupidity  this isn t just a movie  this is every juvenile pervert s dreams   fantasies come true   deathstalker  has it all  blood  violence  trolls  female mud wrestling  attempted rape  successful rape  life sized pigs   awful hairstyles  hideously oiled muscular bodies  multi sexual orgies  gay warriors  tournaments to the death  delirious witches  dismemberment  laughable villains and boobs  boobs  booooooooobies   deathstalker  literally wipes the floor with its obvious role model  conan  the barbarian  when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance  the story is  evidently  of minor importance  lone and gay  only he doesn t know it yet  warrior deathstalker goes on a mission  as commanded by an annoying witch  to gather the three notorious elements of creation
 or something like that  on his journey he combines forces with a troll turned human  a fighter who s even gayer than he is and   last but not least   a luscious lady who doesn t really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras  together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil munkar where they ll participate in a warriors  tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements  munkar is bald guy with half a spider s web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous  okay  granted   deathstalker  is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie  the fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make up effects are downright pitiable  for a moment  when beholding the opening sequence  i actually feared i was watching  troll  the prequel  the monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing  but it s undeniable entertainment if you re in an undemanding mood  i presume this isn t a favorite amongst feminists  as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat 
um
discriminating  most of the gals exclusively serve as eye candy in the harem  they re allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud  but strictly forbidden to open their mouths  the two  leading  ladies  barbi benton and lana clarkson  are ravishing but   in all honesty   if it wouldn t be for their continuously exposed racks  they would hardly be worth mentioning  either
