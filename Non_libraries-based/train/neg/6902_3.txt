despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in new zealand  any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved  apart from a clich s only plot  the movie is let down by some weak acting  accents  and overall lack of tension   whilst having the overall look of a big budget  for nz  the feel is decidedly small town kiwi   has anyone not seen the brothers         those who have will pick the similarities straightaway i ve heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clich d  boys talking crap  but it comes across as forced   i believe oscar keightley sees himself as deeply ironic  but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious   those who have any doubts left at all that samoans living in nz culture has been deeply   hopefully not permanently  affected by american speech   culture  and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie   robbie magasiva always looks good on screen   but is let down by the script   it always rubs me up the wrong way when a  comedy  has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way  you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clich d punchline   see the wanna be white boy   i know someone who found this movie hilarious  however  that person has the brains of a tadpole  and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars   that kinda sums up the mentality of this flick   ok but not great   fun but not funny wake up nz   this is not a   star movie despite all the glowing  middle class white guilt       reviews   my advice   if you watch it  get drunk first
