this crap is like watching paint dry  i m so disappointed because i was so eager to see it   there simply is no meaning to this film  if it were never made  no one would notice or care  it s hyped up because of all the big names in it  but if  nobody s  were in  nobody would give this film any love   seriously  i was at the point where half way through the film i would look at vanessa redgrave and think   hurry up and die already  this is like the  joy luck club  without any of the friggin  joy  it s the  ocean s    nothing but a big named cast  of mother daughter movies and completely anti climatic oh until it s finally over   i m sure they ll all be nominated for oscars       stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
