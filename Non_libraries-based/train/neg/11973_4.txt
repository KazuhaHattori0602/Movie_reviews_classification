this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far  among more than   french movies i have ever seen  terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless  with all that it doesn t matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story   one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people  as an audience i don t care what happens to them    it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes  man  i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes  but not this one  a major disappointment for me
