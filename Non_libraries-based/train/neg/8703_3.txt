primal species   dir  jonathan winfrey    international terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turn out to contain living dinosaurs  the army commando team now have to think fast  if they want to prevent the extinction of the human species  instead of the reptiles   you look at the cover and you gain your first impressions of the film  that is pretty much it  the acting is only just acceptable from a few characters  the story is poor  with the whole film based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs  this film came out three years after  jurassic park  instead  this film looks to have come out   years before  jurassic park  the dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made  and i do mean costumes  there are obviously people dressed up  and this film makes no attempts at hiding this  a scene when a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way  in which it looks like someone is riding the creature  the is one good thing  which comes out of this film  the short running time  at only   hour and   minutes  it doesn t waste too much of your life  but still try to avoid it altogether    it s like a friday the  th nightmare    officer  brian currie
