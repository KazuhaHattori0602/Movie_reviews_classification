well since seeing part s   through   i can honestly say that they should have never made part   everything from the tacky  and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting  i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds   i mean parts   to   kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion  but without him around in this one it s just not the same  sure by the end of part   i was getting a little tired of the continued story line s  but it was a good closure at the end of the third one  again there was no reason for a part   even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through  lol  there goes an hour and a half of my life i ll never see again
