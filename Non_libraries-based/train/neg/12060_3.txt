offering a killer combo of terrible writing  terrible acting and terrible direction  it s a tossup whether kinjite  forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad  it s almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest  seediest cannon film  as if a glance at a cast list including characters like  lesbian pedophile   perverted gentleman   porno actress  weren t enough  it s your only chance to see charles bronson s cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo   but don t worry  it s okay  as the offscreen screams make clear he s only torturing him for information  after all  even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter  he s a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william o connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice   or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine  but then that s what you get for telling him  look  i think you re a little bit unstable  still  when later offered a bribe  he may snarl  i d like to shove this up your ass  but i don t want to get my hands dirty  he s clearly learned where to draw the line  instead  he just makes him eat a   watch and sets fire to his cadillac  the anal obsession even follows through to the film s title  despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set  the film s only direct example of kinjite forbidden subjects  as alex hyde white s english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen  is  er talking about your bowel movements in polite society   bronson isn t just too old for this  as the opening fight makes only too clear  he s too old for love interest peggy lipton  and she looks old enough to have grown up kids  a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material  here s he s given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks  when he s not widening the circles of suspects he s accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings  he s definitely not a p c  copper  with a special loathing for the japanese   as if it wasn t bad enough that they re buying up american businesses  what s worse  they double park on a public thoroughfare  no racial minority goes unassaulted  be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk  no cop clich  unrecycled  be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner  perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that s so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own  the twin plot strands   bronson s l a  cop trying to take down juan hernandez s pimp who deals in underage girls and james pax s porn obsessed japanese businessman   take forever to intertwine  and then in the most unlikely of ways  after copping a feel of bronson s daughter on a bus  some oriental guy touched my holy of holies  in the film s idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez  you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say   how d ya like them apples   somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is  but the execution is pure rising sun  the archie bunker version  shot like out takes from an r rated  s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot em up and blow em up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count  the last of bronson s mostly bad to in different collaborations with j  lee thompson   and sadly thompson s last film as director   it s a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to
