 a damsel in distress  is definitely not one of fred astaire s better musicals  but even astaire s bad films always had some good moments   in  damsel  astaire is jerry halliday  an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour  he meets lady alice marshmorton  year old joan fontaine  a beautiful english heiress  who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers   jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt  he tries to rescue her from her family s country manor house  but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry  keggs  reginald gardiner  the conniving butler  and albert  harry watson  the bratty house boy  each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice s romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet   this musical has numerous problems  first  there is the plot  based on a novel by p g  wodehouse  who co wrote the screenplay  the story is slow  painful  and nerve grating  when fred is not dancing  we have to endure endless annoying scenes of  a  fred romancing joan fontaine or  b  keggs and albert conniving against them and each other   the butler and the house boy are especially irritating  they are one dimensional stock villain characters  the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth  you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance   astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner  ginger rogers  joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film  and is miscast in a musical  she has little going for her  character wise  other than her lovely face and beautiful smile   george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride  as jerry s publicist and his ditzy secretary  the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot  and gracie has some funny lines  but she is also very annoying at times   the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done  at times  the cinematography is horrible and off focus  there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets  to try to convince the audience that we are in london  not hollywood   they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie  on the plus side  the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific  and have become classic song standards  and of course  the dancing in the movie is exceptional  thanks to astaire and his choreographer  hermes pan   but the musical and dance numbers are ill used and ill staged  at times  the cast seems to start singing and dancing because  well  it s time for them to start singing and dancing  the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot   at one point  the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason  the numbers include     i m dancing and i can t be bothered now    fred dances well on a foggy traffic filled london street  he does some great  cane twirling  with a rolled umbrella   but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double decker bus   in the broadway musical   crazy for you  harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls      put me to the test    fred  george  and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage  george and gracie match fred step for step  but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason      stiff upper lip   the fun house number    at an amusement park fun house  fred  george  and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor  rotating barrel  and with the fun house mirrors  it s the best number of the movie  but it gets a little repetitious at times      things are looking up    fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film  prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate  fortunately  it s a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer      a foggy day in london town    fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night  crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london  at times  he looks as if he s not sure which way he s going in the fog   much like the musical number itself      nice work if you can get it    a great song that is misused in the movie  during a social event at the manor house  fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song  each time fred joins in  the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave   again  harry groener did a better dance number with this song in  crazy for you     drum dance number    as fred and joan are eloping  fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums  as usual  it s a great dance number  but there s absolutely no need for it  except to prolong the movie   the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine  as he leaps from the balcony  he finds a conveniently placed trapeze   that s right  a  trapeze    hanging from a nearby tree  fred  or rather  a stuntman in fred s clothes  grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it   the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone  but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote  the  ff button allows you to skip through the other  boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers
