remember the name kevin lime   and please  please never let  him direct again  timing  pacing  editing  all hopelessly wrong   three or four decent professionals  next time  guys  walk off the  set  can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like alice  evans  and the kind of production standards you d expect from  teen produced children s shows on british tv   greatest mystery  the music  a score so inept  inappropriate and  ill matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is  a case of sabotage  add an acoustic that booms apparently  unengineered from a single mike  and a director who only  intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen  and we  have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of  recent years
