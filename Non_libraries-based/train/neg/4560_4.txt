men in black   was a real disappointment for me  while the actors did a pretty good job  especially smith  there just isn t a cure for a poor script once in production  the movie really had a  sequel  kind of feel  playing off partial events of the first film  the story was  in a word  bad  at best  it wasn t thought out well  and seemed very choppy and incoherent at times   in the first flick  the mib organization had a kind of  elite  force feel  you had a few special agents  and it had a  clandestine  kind of feel to it  in the sequel  the mib organization has a jrotc summer camp vibe   the movie wasn t terrible or anything  it just lacked the  coolness   for lack of a better phrase  of the first movie  a lot of the same old humor was recycled from the first to the second  and didn t really add any originality to the mib universe   a perfect analogy would be episode   to the first   films  was it decent  yeah  is it worthy of bearing it s title  not really
