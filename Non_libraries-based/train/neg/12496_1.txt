to be brutally honest  i loved watching severed  that s why i  gave it a   stars because of its starkly unimaginative  story filming acting everything  this film was a riot to watch  if  you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them  you will  really get a kick out of severed   the story really doesn t matter  it involves some guy who s bald  and has a sword and goes around beheading random people    but he has a supernatural twist  nobody ever sees him do it    even when  in one very memorable scene  he walks into a  jampacked night club and whacks off some girl s noodle and  nobody sees it    severed doesn t merely look like it was filmed on video  it was  filmed on someone s home camcorder  the filmmakers had  knowledge of lighting  very thin knowledge  and composition  actually holds together in some scenes  but mostly you can t hear  the actors  you can t understand what they re doing  and you laugh  when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body   go and rent this movie  support films like this  they are a hoot and  a hollar
