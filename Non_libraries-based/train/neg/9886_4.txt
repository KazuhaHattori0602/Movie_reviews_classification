this is peter falk s film  period   i was   years old when this film came out  i was already a film maven at the time  of course neither my parents nor i saw this film when it came out  but i was in love with the typeface of its ads   the aura that this was an important film  okay    years later i ve finally seen the film having never seen any cassavetes directed film previously  he s a hack  overall  zero sense of timing  editing  gena s performance reminds me too much of dustin hoffman s stint in  rain man  technically on par but entirely one note  as tom cruise stole  rain man  falk takes the cake for this film   i was annoyed with gena s performance  really throughout it seemed better suited for  awakenings   blecch  it s not all her fault  she s a basket case from first scene to last  we never find out why  but falk s character seems real   is performed wonderfully by falk as a seriously flawed man   shave off at least an hour  an editor needed  and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple  cro magnon  man coming to grips with a wife who doesn t work   yet cannot deal with her three kids   her husband s long hours of work   i d rather remember cassavetes for  the dirty dozen  or  rosemary s baby  he would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess as he amply demonstrates with this film   bob
