i screamed my head off because seeing this movie was my first movie going experience ever at some   months old  i remember it being incredibly bloody and it made me angry  i watched it again on tv a few years ago  big mistake   the acting is wooden  the plot non existent and the movie lacks merit unless   year old t   a is what gets you going
