if it wasn t for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless stoners  i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone   the plot centers around a   year high school reunion  which takes place in a supposed abandon high school looks more like a prop from a  s low budget horror flick  and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on  this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge   john hughes falls in love with his characters too much  as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady goonies  anne ramsey  we re led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed  but never see a blasted thing  this is a horrible movie that continued national lampoon s downward spiral throughout the  s and  s
