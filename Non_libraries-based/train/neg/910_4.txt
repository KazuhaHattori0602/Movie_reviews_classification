the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring  some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor   there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script  lena endre was good looking as always   i don t remember the original movie so i can t say if it s better or worse   if you enjoy movies like s llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at
