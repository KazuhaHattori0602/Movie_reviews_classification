well  first off  if you re checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead  type film  forget it  this is about  zombies  in a more psychological sense  where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will  but who must instead follow the will of another  the  zombies  here  as little as they are in the film  are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general  as in wartime  it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film   the film is set during world war i  a  french cambodian  contingent had heard strange stories about zombification supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes  armand louque  dean jagger  brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification  but he won t talk  so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to  wipe out the white race   one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script  the film begins as if it will explore the zombie military metaphor  and maybe even have adventure elements  but after about   minutes  it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story   halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power  and a nietzschean  will to power  the film is interesting on that level  but the script and the editing are very choppy  this is yet another older film for which i wouldn t be surprised if there is missing footage  especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue   amidst the contrived romance story  halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread  but little of the zombie material makes much sense  louque discovers the secret of zombification  but it doesn t mean much to the viewer  the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusing halperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi s googly eyes from his   film  white zombie  but never explains what it has to do with anything  there are big gaps in the plot  including the love story  promising  interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time  one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much   if you re a big fan of old  creaky b movies  revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once the acting isn t all that bad  and if you ve got a good imagination  you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps  but this is the second time i ve seen the film  with the first only being about five years ago  and i could barely recall anything about it so it s not exactly memorable
