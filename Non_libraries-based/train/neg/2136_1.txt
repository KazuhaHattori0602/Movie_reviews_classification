quite possibly the worst movie that i have ever seen  when has hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked republicans  why don t they learn  the dixie chicks haven t  these lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves  oblivious to the fact that most of america is much further right than they are   the best hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all   dan akroyd s imitation of cheney was bad   i would have thought cussack could have landed better movies   it wasn t funny
