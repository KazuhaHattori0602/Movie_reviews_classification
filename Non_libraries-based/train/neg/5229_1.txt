boring stuff we got here  his   minute shorts are better than this  know why  because there only   minutes and not   minutes or how ever long this is    the plot is kinda  eh  the last half hour is alright the rest is boring and not funny   i had my hopes up  the trailer made it look funny but the pace of this movie is pretty slow and sadly not funny  just plain boring klaymen running into each other and trying to make us laugh  not working   maybe next time knox   maybe re cutting this movie and adding better scenes would do a lot of healing but for now its just not good
