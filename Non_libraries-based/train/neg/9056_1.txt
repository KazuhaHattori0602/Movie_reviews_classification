i ve seen some crappy movies in my life  but this one must be among the very worst  definately bottom   material  imo  that is   we follow two couples  the dodds  billy bob thornton as lonnie earl and natasha richardson as darlene  and the kirkendalls  patrick swayze as roy and charlize theron as candy  in one car on a roadtrip to reno   apparently  lonnie isn t too happy with his sex life  so he cheats on his wife with candy  who s despirately trying to have a baby  roy  meanwhile  isn t too sure if his sperm is ok so he s getting it checked by a doctor   now  i had read the back of the dvd  but my girlfriend didn t  and she blurted out after about   minutes   oh yeah  she s gonna end up pregnant but her husband can t have any baby s  spot on  as this movie is soooo predictable  as well as boring  and annoying  meaningless  offensive  terrible   an example of how much this movie stinks  the two couples set out in their big car towards nevada  when they are stopped by   police officers  as they didn t stop at a stop sign  the guys know each other and finally bribe the two officers with a case of beer  not only is this scene pointless and not important  or even relevant  for the movie  it takes about   minutes  it s just talk and talk and talk  without ever going somewhere   i still have to puke thinking about the ending though  apparently  roy isn t having problems down there so he is the father of the child  how many times does that happen in the movies  try something new  the cheated wife ultimately forgives her husband and best friend for having the affair and they all live happily ever after  yuck   best scene of the movie is right at the end  with a couple of shots of the grand canyon  why couldn t they just keep the camera on that for   minutes   one would expect more from this cast  although thornton really tries  but you can t really blame them  writers  shame on you
