i can t understand why so many peoples praised this show  twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life   now i have seen all season   episodes  and seeing season   episode   simply i can t take this show anymore     where is the proper induction in criminal investigation   in season   there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle  can you guess why he did that  he just want to identify murderer by doing this  joke  while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream  wow     there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show   for example  season   started with a  funny  scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor  he got the gun shoots in his belly already    this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments  that s all   this scene is really boring and even long     min   sec  it s like hell     i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore
