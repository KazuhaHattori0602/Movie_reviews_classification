i pity people calling kamal hassan  ulaganaayakan  maybe for them ulagam is tollywood   comeon guys this movie is a thriller without thrill   come out of your ulagam and just watch some high class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lambs   technically good but style over substance kamal doesn t look like a police officer  there is no thrill whatsoever dragging and boring till end you might be saving   valuable hrs of your life if u skip watching this movie   kamal at his best is the best in tollywood
