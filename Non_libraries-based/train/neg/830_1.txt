i really don t understand all these positive user reviews  this movie is the worst movie i ve ever seen and i m not trying to be pessimistic   eva mendez is hot but terrible in this film  but i don t think it is her own fault but the directors  he have somehow managed to make everything look artificial  their acting  the idea  the make up  everything   the star i m giving is only for the idea behind the movie  which was very bad executed   don t watch this bullshit  go watch a fellini  woody allen or some david lynch
