mr perlman gives a standout performance  as usual  sadly  he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces   larsen is in  die hard  mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles  i m sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part   the lovely erika is very decorative  even though fully clothed  and shows some signs of  getting  acting at last   sfx are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies   the shootouts are pitiful   worthy of the a team  not even worth seeing for perlman   avoid
