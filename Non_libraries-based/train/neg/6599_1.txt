who was george c  scott  george c  scott was a renowned actor  practically any movie that he s been in is the better off for it  now ol  george had absolutely nothing to do with this movie  but he once said something that describes said movie to a t   i don t recall his exact words  but he basically said that great writing can save bad acting  but great acting cannot save bad writing  never has this little observation been truer than in  the all new adventures of laurel   hardy  for love or mummy   the casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect  bronson pinchot  laurel  and gailard sartain  hardy  not only look the parts  but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal  mannerisms and all  this movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents  that said  this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to  you guessed it  writing   aside from the opening dialogue between pinchot and sartain  which was very  in character  and a brief gag involving a taxi  this movie is an absolute chore to sit through   problem     too much time and effort went into the plot   i don t want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty british lady  what i want is to see stan and ollie  or at least  their stand ins  way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around   however  even if this movie had been all jokes  that would still leave us with    problem     most of the jokes are what i would call  watered down  slapstick    what do i mean by  watered down   in slapstick  a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect  ala looney tunes    stooges or how about laurel   hardy   in  watered down  slapstick  as i define it  a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced  and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect   maybe an illustration would help   in looney tunes  daffy duck gets shot by elmer fudd  his bill falls off and he puts it back on  that is classic slapstick   in this  gem  ollie accidentally bumps into some people  they turn around  tell him to be careful  and continue on their merry way  that s not slapstick  that s not even funny  that s just boring and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes  it s as though they re this movie s bread and butter  the writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they re supposed to be funny  granted  the example i just gave is the most extreme case  but i can only cut it so much slack   long story short  the film just doesn t work because the script fails to capitalize on pinchot s and sartain s abilities to impersonate stan and ollie  instead  the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes  watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with   not a good movie  but an incredible sleeping aid   i say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal  just so long as you steer clear of  atoll k  and  be big
