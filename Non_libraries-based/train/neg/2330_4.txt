i liked how this started out  featuring some decent special effects especially for a film   years old  there was some pretty impressive scenery  however  the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis  altaira morbius   viewing this in the  s after a long absence  it was fun to see francis again  an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released and is still acting  it also was interesting to see a young looking leslie nielsen  dr  john j  adams  who i wouldn t have recognized had it not been for this voice   i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep  i appreciated them re doing this vhs tape in stereo  but it was a weak effort  this is one those overrated film where  elites  think is so  heavy  and  thought provoking  that s nonsense  it only appeared  intelligent  because the rest of the  s sci fi films were so stupid   some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen  which i didn t have at the time of this writing  perhaps another look   this time on the   widescreen transfer would make me change this review
