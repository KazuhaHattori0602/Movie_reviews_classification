power rangers  the moronic merchandising television kids show from the  s  has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created   what exactly is the point of this show anyway  other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children  there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway   look at the costumes  which look like spandex gone bad   the mullet style hair  earrings  and fashions of the early  s look completely ridiculous these days   avoid this show at all costs
