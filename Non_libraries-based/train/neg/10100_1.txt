usually i support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant i tend to support everybody  because their efforts are worth   but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits   imagine the following situation     think about the really worst horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far     think about some great  attractive art for that movie s dvd box and a promising plot     voil  you got zombie nation   see it only if you really don t have anything else better to do  anything is better
