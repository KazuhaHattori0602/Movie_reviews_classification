the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham fisted and clich  ridden   i cant blame the actors  but surely someone must have said  are you joking i cant say this   this episode had a press perspective and police perspective  while the police perspective was standard enough  the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable   i notice that this was an hbo co production  if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light   i was completely cringing during the press conference scene  it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true    minutes into the first episode and i am still waiting for the suspense   skip five daysthis  the   production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top   this story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable   for a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions   so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour   i then began looking for journalists called  scoop  and for perry white to make an appearance   i saw the   hunter before  five days made it to australia  not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to bonneville and mcteer going around again   head shakingly awful
