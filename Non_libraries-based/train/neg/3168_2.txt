i had to shut this off after about   execrable moments   i was hoping it might improve   what i saw was badly acted  directed   written   this movie should never even have been released directly to dvd   the lead character who is a bride top be from hell has an huge ice sculpture fall on her killing her  she was such a revolting person i was not even sorry for her  she winds up there in a sort of heaven    was still repulsive  i left shortly after   eve longoria portrays her   i hope i never see her again  she cant even act she is just plain annoying   paul rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud   jason biggs   no longer a teen  is also present   i do like comedies but not stupid ones about stupid people   rating     out of     points  out of   imdb    out of
