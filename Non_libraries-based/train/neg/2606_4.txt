drew barrymore plays young holly gooding  who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick highsmith  george newbern  and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her  doppelganger  or evil twin  is out to kill her and her family   this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously  even if the film makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious   doppelganger  is muddled  with some unpleasantly dumb dialog   some viewers will note that drew s character s name is drawn from audrey hepburn s role in  breakfast at tiffany s  and that newbern s character s name is a play on the name of famed author patricia highsmith  he is actually trying to re write  breakfast  as a horror film  believe it or not   i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film   i mean  writer director avi nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters  and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare   after a silly villain explains everything to the audience confrontation  the film goes on to submit a hideous  out there climax that has to be seen to be believed  this film certainly does not skimp on the gore   but hey  drew kills her mother in this one  no  i m not joking  jaid barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered   drew is always very watchable  and very sexy in this one  newbern comes off as a likable enough   nice  sort of guy  but the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with sally kellerman  an attractive veteran who s very professional in her one scene as a former nun who s started a phone sex business   the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy  sordid little level
