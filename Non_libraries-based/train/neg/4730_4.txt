when i was seventeen i genuinely believed elvis to be the king of rock and roll  and not only did i wish to see all   of his  character  movies  but it was my ambition to own them  too  what an exceptionally poor excuse for a seventeen year old i must have been  thankfully sense prevailed and live a little  love a little is the only elvis film i own   the spotlight has fallen on this one recently since a remixed version of top song a little less conversation has been released as a single   his first to reach the uk top ten in   years   his first uk no  in   even when i was seventeen and in serious need of psychiatric help i realised that the songs for this movie weren t exactly first rate  however  a little less conversation   rollnecks and  s grooving aside   is a real standout  finding a lesser known song that only a relatively small few are aware of promoted into the mainstream produces a mixture of emotions  it s nice to finally see faith in a song vindicated  but it s also saddening to see the disintegration of your own private cult   and what chauvinistic lyrics  too  though what other elvis song contains the word  procrastinate   but what really bothers me about this film is not a little less conversation but the   minutes that surround it  actually based on a novel  kiss my firm but pliant lips   what kind of lame novel would that be  this one sees a bored elvis holed up with a  comedy  dog and a nympho  within   seconds of meeting him  michele carey asks  would you like to make love to me  quite a fast mover by any standards i m sure you ll agree   i do seem to recall that some of elvis s early movies   most notably jailhouse rock and king creole   weren t too bad  but this is just identikit hillbilly cobblers  being fired from a newspaper job can lead to a five minute karate fight with a couple of gingernuts  causing a motorway pile up is good for a laugh  and models dress as pink mermaids  there s even a dream sequence for god s sake  maybe the only dumb stereotype it doesn t conform to is in not having all that many songs  with just four to choose from  including the credits number  you re waiting an average of   minutes between tracks  some movies would become vapid by having too many tunes  but here they might have helped to have numbed the pain  of the remaining three tracks  then the edge of reality isn t actually that bad  though elvis s dance to it must surely have been called  the bear trap   in one sense  for a pg certificate film from   then this is shockingly high on sexual content  sadly  however  with talking dogs  middle america sitcom values and the stiffest dancing you ll ever see  elvis s dignity is obliterated by this movie
