please  be warned  this movie  though a pretty bad storyline  was one of the most gruesome movies i have seen ever  just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie   so  it officially begins with a party  just your average party but there s some guy there  he s pretty into kate if you know what i m saying  memorise his face  it ll help later   so anyway kate goes of to find george clooney  didn t i say the plot was bad  and so takes the tube  that s london underground at the middle of the night  but she s just stupid like that  so the timetable says the next  and last  train will come in   minutes  now kate  dumb party girl that she is  decides that she can have a nap in the spare   minutes  typically  she misses the train and finds herself locked in the london underground  alone  well  almost   so the movie just carries on from there  blood  guts  limbs  even certain parts of the body i shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body   in short  it s a typical horror  pretty but thick damsel in distress type women and sick  weird psycho  or as the case may have it  creep   i d say give it a go if you re into saw  hostel or the texas chainsaw massacre but for the rest of us  scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much
