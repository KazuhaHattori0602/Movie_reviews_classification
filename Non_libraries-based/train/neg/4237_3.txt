judaai was a bold film by raj kanwar at it s time in   when such a topic was damn out of the box  to give him his credit he does succeed in showing how greed changes a person and to what extent the person can go to get what she wants  the film however is damn melodramatic  many places ridiculous  one wonders why anil doesn t buy a tv for his wife  when he earns so much just to show how poor he is   the twist is well handled but the handling is straight out of  s the johny  paresh comedy which entertains here and there stands out as a sore thumb as it doesn t fit in the story  even there are several cringeworthy scenes  direction by raj kanwar is adequate though at times too melodramatic music is okay but most songs look forced  anil does his part well sridevi is excellent in her part urmila is decent amongst rest kader khan is as usual johny lever is funny  paresh irritates farida is decent
