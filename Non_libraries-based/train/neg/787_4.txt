as an inspiring director myself  this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind  shot with low end digital camera probably with  mm adapter for dof  the editing is good acting decent  sound effects aren t too over the top  i would have give it a   for an indie film  but the story aren t that interesting  it s more on the drama side  character developments than a horror flick   it s not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out  or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy   honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the  s  this movie is about a family who has a dry field  and that is just that
