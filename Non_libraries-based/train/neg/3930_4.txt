the second renaissance  part   let s us show how the machines first revolted against the humans  it all starts of with a single case  in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well  while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want   although an interesting premise  the story gets really silly from then on with  violent  riots between the robots and mankind  somehow it doesn t seem right  as another reviewer points it  it s all a little too clever   the animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix  in particular osiris  work for the best  as for second renaissance part   i d say it s too violent and too silly
