i have given this film an elevated rating of   stars as i personally appear in minutes   and   of the film the road side bar scene in russia  in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line     dollars you drink and talk  but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could  so i declined to take this speaking part on  i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience and who knows  these lines could have ended up there with lines such as  i ll be back  and  quite frankly my dear  i don t give a damn  had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as  heavy   instead of the name of ryszard janikowski    as time goes on  i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film   even though i spent a whole day on the set  in south wales hot spot barry island  no one could tell me what the actual storyline was  the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it  things could certainly have been worse if i d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films   still on the positive side i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break  i had no idea who he was  as  notting hill  was yet to be released  and not an inkling that he might be welsh  made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the  s and  s  it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production
