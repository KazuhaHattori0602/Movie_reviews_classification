i am a big fan of karishma kapoor and govinda  i watched this film after i had seen fiza  which was absolutley brilliant   there are films that are bad  and there are films that are cr p  but this film just takes the biscuit   we were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film   avoid at all cost  dont even rent it
