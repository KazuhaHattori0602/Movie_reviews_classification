this wasn t funny in   it s not funny now   unlike a lot of other people  i m not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist   i quote enjoyed that bit  or rather i enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying pc people   i m bashing it because it is poorly written and acted   the only really memorable character is blakey  which british people   years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long time   avoid
