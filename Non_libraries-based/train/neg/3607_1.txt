i am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film  do not read further here it comes  avert your eyes  the main heroine  the girl who always survives in other slasher films  is murdered here  there  i just saved you   minutes of your life   this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the  s  despite killing the heroine off  this is just substandard junk   both priests and college students get a bad rap here  they are pictured as oversexed  sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life and the college students come off even worse    splatter university  is just gunk to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do  although i suggest watching your head cleaner tape  that would be more entertaining   this is rated  r  for strong physical violence  gore  profanity  very brief female nudity  and sexual references
