this is what happens when you re living in china and the local video store is running thin on english language titles you are blessed with this work of what appears to be  yes  romanian cinema  nevertheless  i think that it has real comedic potential   spoilers technically follow   though i don t think that it would in fact spoil anyone s viewing pleasure to ask why a film set in a casino has a scene of beach archery  even in flashback  that mystery  and many other conundrums  remain to be exploited by desperate comedians  perhaps when they re stuck in bucharest   let me also wonder aloud why perfectly good looking people allow themselves to abuse themselves on film like this  it s sad
