in   john hughes wrote and directed  planes  trains and automobiles  which was a hilarious and poignant comedy   the best thing he s ever done  ten years on he s reduced to again recycling the plot of  home alone  in this second sequel  which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic  the four crooks   that s right  four  and one of them is a girl  congratulations  hughes  for introducing this revolutionary change to the series    are electrocuted with metal chairs  brained with barbells and blinded with paint  ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha  while the new kid is even less charming than culkin  you d think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from fossilising the same old routines  but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for  home alone
