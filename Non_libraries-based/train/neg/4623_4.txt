if you haven t seen the gong show tv series then you won t like this movie much at all  not that knowing the series makes this a great movie    i give it a   out of   because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems     it s a funny snapshot of the era it was made in  the late  s and early  s    you get a lot of funny cameos of people you ve seen on the show    it s interesting to see chuck  the host  when he isn t doing his on air tv personality    you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show   i won t list all the bad things because there s a lot of them  but here s a few of the most prominent     the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length    the movie s story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point    chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor  but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top  s flatness   it s a good movie to watch when you don t have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once  watch   minutes at a time and it s not so bad  but even then it s not so good either
