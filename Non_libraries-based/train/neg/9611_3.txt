there are so many goofy things about this movie that i can t possibly name but a few   bogart s character    his name   whip mccord  too easy  so i ll leave it at that  boy  it makes `humphrey  sound good    his long  curly hair and silly sideburns    his black bart get up  complete with spurs    not sure what shade of lipgloss they ve got him wearing  but it ain t none too flattering   cagney s character  jim kincaid     his lipstick doesn t do him any favors  either    the man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film  could they not find a hat to fit him  even a little    his pants are too tight in the rear    he blows the smoke off his gun one too many times  if you know what i mean  and i think you do   if you are a casual bogart or cagney fan  and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western  do yourself a favor and forget that thought  even the horses look embarrassed   that is  when they don t look bored   in all fairness  i admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre  but i ve still seen much  much better than this   on a comedy level  or as high camp  the oklahoma kid works  otherwise  it s viewer beware  therefore  see this only if a  you must see every western out there b  you are a true cagney or bogie completist c  any of the above comments appeal to you  woah
