 in an otherwise ghastly  misbegotten  would be oedipal comedy   i was the lone victim at a   screening tonight   days after the movie opened    so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings   the bloom is off jon heder s rose  the emerging double chin isn t his fault  but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply isn t working  it would be another crime if this were to be eli wallach s last screen appearance  diane keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck   basically because so few will have seen her in this  the very worst vehicle she s chosen in the last few weeks   sitting alone in the theater tonight i came alive  laughed  even  whenever daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film s sole three dimensional character  he really is among our very best actors   in summary  even jeff daniels s work can t redeem this picture
