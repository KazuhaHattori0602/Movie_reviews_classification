absolutely one of the worst movies of all time   low production values  terrible story idea  bad script  lackluster acting  and i can t even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan river s directing is  i know that there s a special place in hell for the people who financed this film  prolly right below the level reserved for child raping genocidal maniacs   this movie is a trainwreck    terrible  x  infinity    rabbit test   avoid this at all costs   it s so bad  it isn t even funny how bad it is
