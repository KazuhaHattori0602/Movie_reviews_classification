i am working my way through the chilling classics   movie pack collection and the witches  mountain  el monte de las brujas is something like the  th movie in the set   the movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all  the plot was incoherent  the dialog seemed improvised  the acting was poor  the characters were unsympathetic   the best scene is the beginning  with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter  however  the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie  is the lead character  mario  who has the most stupendous mustache ever  but  that s it   the film was not effective on any level  the music was too intrusive  the lighting was very dark  so that some scenes are almost completely black  it really is barely watchable   what more can i say
