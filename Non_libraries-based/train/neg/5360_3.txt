 nada  was the most inadequate follow up to  les noces rouges  which with hindsight appears now as the last good movie of chabrol s golden era    nada  is chabrol s first real attempt at a wholly political movie its previous work  les noces rouges  had also political elements but it was more a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in french provinces nada  includes terrorists ambassador hostage taking a lot of blood not really chabrol s field a heterogeneous cast gives the movie the coup de gr ce  only duchaussoy who had already played with the director  and maurice garrel are up to scratch viviane romance  one of duvivier s actresses  la belle equipe   panique   is wasted as a madam  gabrielle italian actors  fabio testi lou castel are awful   with  nada  this a second period of barren inspiration for chabrol  it would be  violette nozi res  before he was again at the top of his game
