it was   pm last night at my friend s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park  a new episode  the thing is  in my country  south park airs at   pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing  father of the pride  i ll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes  the first time i watched it  i found it unfunny and crude for nothing  so i thought  holy sh t  i have a football game early tomorrow  so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons  but yesterday  i tried to give father of the pride a second chance  i find that it s a complete rip off of the simpsons  only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead   the second thing is i wonder why it got it s tv  rating  i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar  and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual  unfunny  jokes  the simpsons is also a lot more violent  halloween specials  and crude  i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek   well i ve got news for him  shrek   was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic  however  i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile  even burst out laughing once  three or four times   all in all  i don t mind father of the pride  i don t hate it  but i don t like either  i ve seen way better from  the simpsons
