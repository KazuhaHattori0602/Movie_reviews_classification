 spoilers khamosh is totally unrealistic  lacks a plot  and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves  the most suspenseful scene in the movie was when shabana azmi is in the shower and then we see her tv playing the shower scene from psycho  this movie actually expected users to believe that naseeruddin shah s character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many    spoiler begins   at the end  the killer spills his guts to shabana azmi long enough to allow naseeruddin shah s character to run up and shoot him    spoiler ends   it is a little humorous  only a little  in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing shabana azmi exclaim   oh sh t   overall  a baaaaaaaaaaad movie   rating    out of     out of
