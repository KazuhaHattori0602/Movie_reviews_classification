first off i really enjoyed zombi   by lucio fulci  this film was utter trash  i couldn t stand to watch it  the storyline was a joke  the acting was a joke  and the fact that zombi   has nothing to do with zombi   is even more a joke   we jump from voodoo to death   the harmful agent brining people back to life  whatever  this movie isn t worth the   it cost to rent it  i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible  if zombi   is an indicator for how zombi   and   are going to be i think i will just skip them   zombi   is an awesome flique tho
