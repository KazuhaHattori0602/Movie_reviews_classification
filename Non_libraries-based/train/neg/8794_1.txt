i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked  let alone held in such high regard  especially by so many critics who are  otherwise  quite sensible   there is one key word which describes this film to its core   irritating   the most easily explained example of this is the director s use   or  more accurately  abuse   of music  in the first half  a really dull reggae tune is played about three times  when once is too often  but in the second half  the mommas and the papas  california dreamin  is played at least seven times  usually at top volume  godsakes  whether you liked the song or not beforehand  you d be thoroughly sick of it by the end  just think  some people claim to have seen this film four or five times  this means they ve listened to california dreamin either   or   times   all of this needless hyper repetition  it contributes nothing to the story  could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit  or if the story was in any way involving   but it ain t   the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lin s charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies  even this wore off fairly quickly   i m sure this film s undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it   i can only warn you   if you ve never seen a hk movie before  don t start with this one   if you feel compelled to watch it  avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema  the fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here   you have been warned
