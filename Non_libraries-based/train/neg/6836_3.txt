please  even if you are in the worst of the moods  refrain from watching this flick    i don t think whether anything was right with this movie at all  on a friend s recommendation i watched this and i literally flushed  h and   min of my life down the closet  poor acting  stupid direction  weak storyline and pathetic action sequences   and when you blend this together you get  double impact  even least of the expectations were not met    i guess i did learn one thing   never watch van damme action flicks  they are pure wastage of time
