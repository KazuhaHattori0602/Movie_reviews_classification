i don t know what would be so great about this movie  even worse  why should anyone bother seeing this one   first of all there is no story  one could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling  laughter  cry  fear    but in my opinion this movie does not do that either   you are just watching images for     hrs  there are more useful things to do   i guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above  but is this worth   hrs of your valuable time and   eur of your money   for me the answer is  no
