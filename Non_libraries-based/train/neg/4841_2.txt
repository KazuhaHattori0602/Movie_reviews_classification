really    i am truly amazed to see the glowing reviews here    this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  it is one big pathetic  grainy  clich  i would have laughed out loud  and a lot  but was on a date with an ex military guy  i could not hide my other response  boredom  yes  i think my date  a flat line  good old boy  liked it  that s not a compliment  i know an actor wants to work  fine for the others  but ralph  come on   it was a painful tease from ralph  i vote a   only because ralph looked so stunning  but i must plead  ralph  how could you  and  why    i m going to go watch the end of the affair to heal and recover now  c
