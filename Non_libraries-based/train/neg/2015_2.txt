i really looked forward to this program for two reasons  i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters  i don t like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level  the world speed record for helicopters was set at   mph by a westland lynx several years ago  the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah a in the  s  it hit over   and was a compound helicopter  which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust   in short  no helicopter can fly much over   because of the principle of rotary wing flight  and the bell   the  actor  that portrayed airwolf wasn t very fast even by helicopter standards  and it didn t stay in production very long   there was a movie that came out during this time period called  blue thunder  that was much more realistic
