i didn t even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade  trinity  i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the  crap  that s blade  so i did my quick research  checked the scores on imdb   rottentomatoes for dracula  ascension  and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula   i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing   now let s take a quick personal recap here  i remember seeing dracula   and i remember not liking it at all  and then seeing the scores of dracula  ascension just lowered my expectations even more  but then again  i m the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself  any movie  so that i can form my own opinion   a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it s low budget  so because of that  i m going to have to ignore a lot of the v fx and just figure it s going to compensated by story   acting  i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie  jason london  roy schieder   jason scott lee   oh geez
 this movie was cheesy  but cheesy can be entertaining at least  i found it pretty fricken laughable  the bad audio synch from the re recording of dialogue in a few scenes  the stupidity of the characters in this movie  sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things  luke even had a book on it  but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get  infected  nope  this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on   i also must ve blinked at some point  because i m not sure how  dracula  got clothes on his body  especially since he s big wild and angry   i figure if i was in that situation  i wouldn t want to be the one dressing him   so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy
 it doesn t  instead it s a  cliff hangar  where i now get to wait for the  rd installment  legacy  oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies
