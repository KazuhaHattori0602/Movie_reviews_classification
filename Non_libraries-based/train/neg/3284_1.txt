have i seen a worse movie  perhaps only  manos  the hands of fate  dragged more than  dukes  i had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point  let s touch on a few   there was a noticeable script death and rebirth when sheev is talking to the dukes and they don t respond  he shrugs and moves on  since neither the knoxville or scott know what he s talking about  nor do we  it was like the engine died and was restarted   the few times the general lee flew through the air weren t even that exciting  nothing i haven t seen on the tv series   very little chemistry between knoxville and scott  the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked  the only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it  although roughly  the rest of the time it seems distant and forced   seann william scott s awful  horrendous accent  or lack thereof   i hated willie nelson s performance  were bad jokes supposed to be endearing  i wanted him to disappear   jessica simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen  she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film  that s telling you how horrible this movie is  she s a goddess   during the climax of the film  i was rooting for boss hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of hazzard county  starting with willie nelson and his accomplices  a nuclear bomb would have sufficed   this is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film  but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film   if only we could erase and start over
