as is often the case  films about self loathing characters do not usually make for good drama   downloading nancy  is no exception  it s supposedly based on a true story about a woman who s murdered at her own request by someone she meets over the internet   the protagonist is nancy  maria bello  who is married to albert  rufus sewell  albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game which his company has successfully marketed to various bars and bar restaurants  unlike most human beings  albert has virtually no positive attributes  except for his ability to be successful in the business world  throughout the film  albert has a grim and dour expression on his face  he has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to patronizing prostitutes  when his wife asks for sex  he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead   nancy is equally one note as a character  not only has she had a loveless   year marriage but was sexually abused by her uncle when she was growing up  thankfully there are no flashbacks of that back story in the film  her self loathing takes the form of self mutilation and a result  she s forced into therapy  however  she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made   finally  nancy is so depressed that she contacts louis over the internet  he s sort of a sadomasochistic gigolo  who has sex with women for money while inflicting massive amounts of pain to boot  it s revealed that louis has two children but no longer sees them  the children s mother no longer wants anything to do with him   nancy s plan is to first have painful sex with louis and then have him kill her  there s a particularly unpleasant scene where louis has sex with nancy while slashing her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass  these scenes are shown as flashbacks after louis pays a visit to albert who ties him up and strikes him with a golf club  it seems that louis has a two fold plan in going to see albert    berate him for his treatment of nancy and   enjoy the beating he receives  it takes awhile before louis will reveal nancy s fate first  he forces albert to do him the favor of taking his dog to a relative so someone will care for it in the future  nancy s fate of course is that louis finally ended up choking her to death  but showed some hesitation first as he made it clear that he had some  feelings  for her  we soon learn that louis is imprisoned for life for nancy s murder   what exactly are we to take away from a film such as downloading nancy  are we supposed to feel sorry for victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence  is that the main point of the film  is sympathy for nancy actually warranted  i don t think so  the film s writers create a straw man in the character of albert someone who is so cut off from his emotions that he is the one that is held responsible for nancy s decline  but are people so one dimensional in real life  i think not  they have the repulsive louis  a man who makes a living by inflicting pain  come over and berate albert for neglecting nancy  furthermore  his expressions of love towards nancy  before he kills her  is supposed to show his  sensitive side   in the end  it matters little whether the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie with the various characters in the film  they are so bent on titillating their audience with scenes of gratuitous violence  that downloading nancy becomes nothing more than an exercise in poor taste and soft pornography
