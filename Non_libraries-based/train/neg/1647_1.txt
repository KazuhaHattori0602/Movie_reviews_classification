first and foremost  zorie barber  zeke  might be one of the worst actors i have ever seen  as a character that s supposed to be a hip  village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious  why is he so hyper  over dramatic  and plain horrible  did he know anything about his character before they started filming  did the director  don t the martial arts teach discipline  aside from that  this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen it already gross out humor  hand in toilet   trainspotting   masturbation  hmm   fast times at ridgemont high    american pie   the list goes on   bad dialogue  in one sequence  eric says  it s none of my business  but      and   seconds later mia says  why is this any of your business  bad editing  at least five minutes worth of film are wasted on nyc traffic shots   it s also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight knit group of friends in any world  i can t comment on what makes everyone laugh  but if you enjoy low brow  basic bathroom humor and insults  by all means  enjoy  if you want something a little smarter but on the same lines  see  boomerang   if you want a solid what goes around romantic comedy  go for  the tao of steve   but anyone who thinks  whipped  is witty and an accurate portrayal dating  well  i cannot agree at all
