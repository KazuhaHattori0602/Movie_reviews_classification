i have watched   episodes of caveman  and i have no idea why i continue except maybe waiting for it to get better    to me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials  with no real humor  as we sat around watching these shows  we all speculated on what was going to happen   the episode of the woman cave woman with a attitude was actually a big  yea right  for us  she s crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers  and truth be told  she needed a slap  i consider myself a pretty good reviewer  taking in everything  but i must say  cavemen is comparable to the old show  my mother  the car  i give it a   only because they deserve   better than a   because they actually spent money on it
