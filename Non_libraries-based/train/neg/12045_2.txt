hello there   this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while  i would therefore like to salute you all  the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance   i spent   years of my life   all we greeks did actually  analysing omirus epos  and not homers as you see everywhere  rhyme by rhyme  if i recall well it was iliada  iliad  on  th grade and odysseia  odyssey  on  th grade  warner s troy  was a big disappointment to me and my fellow greeks around the campus  i study in the uk   iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made  it was composed by a greek poet omirus a whole   years after the actual war  historians put trojan war around   bc  and the actual reason of the war not being helen s beauty but the strategically crucial position of troy  that said one may now understand that omirus epos is not presenting the actual events  as it s not accurate historically  but this was never the purpose of this work    reading this huge poem  one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour  love  anger  hate  heroism  discipline  loyalty and so on  the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle  none of these though were revealed in  troy   warner s troy was really cheap to my eyes  and to other intellectual people english finnish and german colleagues of me as well  it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario  by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster  computers graphics did the whole work  and yet it is wolfgang petersen s best work    i conclude saying that you d better watch something else instead  i would give troy   out of   it is a really expensive b movie   cheers   alex
