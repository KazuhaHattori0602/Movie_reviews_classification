whatever happened to british tv drama  from john major through tony blair  the focus of the genre appears to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women focused tales about the piddling domestic problems of nice middle class professionals    or perhaps tvnz doesn t buy the good stuff  please let that be what it is   the writer s long career in soaps probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clich s  niamh cusack s performance is strong on meaningful looks  each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve  baleful looks  however  are a poor substitute for depth of character  if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with    of course this is theoretically a thriller  about a murder investigation  but that s not as important as the central character s failing marriage and its attendant problems  is cusack s character s husband a complete bastard  will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up  making these the central issues isn t a sign of insight   it indicates a profoundly narcissistic identification by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job   lynda la plante knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than housebound neurotics   evidently paula milne isn t up to the task
