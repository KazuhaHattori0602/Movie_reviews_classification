snl is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a short skit on snl is a little dumb minded  it s nothing like snl  it s just a stupid piece of crap   andy samberg tries to act like jon heder but fails  although jon heder is only funny in napoleon dynamite andy tries his hardest and people think he s funny   only funny people in the movie were danny mcbride and bill hader  the only part that was decently funny with andy was the pool part   they could have made the  quiet place  a lot better if they didn t make the falling scene   freaking minutes   the part where he s pronouncing his h s more is retarded  they try going with it too long and half the time it looks like andy is laughing while he acts he s a horrible actor and doesn t deserve to be in a movie   this movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a   year old level of comedy  which is about half the united states
