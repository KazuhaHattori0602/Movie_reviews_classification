i watched like   or   herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me   i watched several documentaries about him  he is obviously an intelligent man  with great knowledge about films and passion for making them  but does this makes him a good director  definitely no  a complete anti talent  he can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits  but a film with actors   never   he can t direct nor write  his screenplays are full of badly thought out situations  and many situations dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word  art  in any sense  no way  not to mention the unskillful direction  so amateurish like  to say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie   like the scene when scheitz gets arrested and storszek hides in the back of the store  who is he kidding   he is a cheater  he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want  he knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising  never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction   just look at julio medem  if herzog can make a movie like medem can  then i might re check his old movies and try to find talent in them
