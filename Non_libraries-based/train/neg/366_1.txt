bad actors  bad filming  choppy dialog  shallow characters  but then again it was a bad premise in the first place  basically  an   year old who is bullied because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal  of course  the   year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house  cash a check for   dollars  and even foil three bumbling idiots  reminiscent of the three stooges    preston blake is an annoying  obnoxious  boy  who decides that  when written a blank check by a complete stranger  he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can  in other words  he wanders into a bank    hands a teller a check he makes in his printer  and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash  preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible speeds on his bicycle  due to the fact that a man driving a jaguar after preston and his  speed could not catch him  even when preston jumped a row of cars   of course  with every hokey adventure movie  there has to be hot heroine  in this case our hot heroine is a child molesting fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston  and promises another date when he turns     however  the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting  nor its sloppy dialog  such as  the only other way i could think of skinning a cat is to stick a hose up it s butt and then pick up the fur  it was  rather  the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people   what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the alias  macintosh  to masquerade as an entrepreneur of sorts  of course  the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston  who uses his  year old wit to first scream when lobsters fall on his face  then treat her to hamburgers  finishing with a ridiculous romp through a cemented area where water jettison s from the ground  our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is slipping and sliding right behind the two  as they make their way to preston s limousine  complete with a  dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap   rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on   overall    is incredibly gracious for this film  i don t see how it only has a
