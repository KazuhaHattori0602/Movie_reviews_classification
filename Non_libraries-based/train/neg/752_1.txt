is it possible to give a movie no stars  i suppose not  however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you ll get my drift  director and photographer timothy hines didn t have much of a budget compared to spielberg s herculean effort with the same material  rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made  but that need not be an insurmountable handicap  i ve seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring  soldier and saints  is a recent example  with hard work  integrity and  above all  talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells  novella   and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its  war of the worlds  unfortunately  hines failed in all these departments  even if he had had spielberg s budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he s foisted on us   primarily  hines seems unable to tell a story  thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound  but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records  a guy walks down a country lane  a lot  he talks badly aped received english to some other guy  then he walks down the same lane  only shot from the back this time to show he s returning   clever  eh  walking and talking  for nearly an hour that s all that happens  ok  i ll grant that one extended excursion from the main character s house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it s a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful  a first year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this  btw  but half a dozen times  back and forth  back and forth  et cetera  et cetera with some yakkity yak in between  remarkable  the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature length film  finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking  or shrieking  later we get staggering and wailing for dessert   thankfully  much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h g  wells  text  else we d have no idea what is going on  but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text  to realize what words alone can t convey  if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel  why bother  why not do a radio play  orson welles made himself a household name doing just that  however  hines thinks he s a filmmaker  so he s content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning   secondly  hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie  but he has no idea how to use them  now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy  i believe good science fiction cinema doesn t need dazzling technical effects  some really potent sci fi s have flourished on virtually none at all  but  the war of the worlds  as film requires a certain baseline effort  wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled  the effects don t need to be complex  they can even be crude  e g  fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal byron haskins   version  but they must be handled well  unfortunately hines  effects are both crude and incompetent   tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum   martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort   skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream   the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times  flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice    and on ad nauseum  crude technique is forgivable  so you have a cg fire effect that s less than convincing  fine  we can work around that  just don t use it too often and only show glimpses of it  that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum  throw it away  it s not necessary  you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string  if you must use it  go ahead  but please don t show it twice  but no  hines won t listen  we get the worst looking stuff used again and again  gotta get those   minutes somehow  boy   next we have acting  or more precisely too much acting  whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out  evidently hines thinks he s getting a bargain   more fleeing in terror over there  you  quaking behind that tree  let s have a real conniption fit this take  you call that writhing in agony  nonsense  my grandmother can writhe better   nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink  they aren t even good amateurs  but this needn t prove fatal  many a good movie has been made with rancid acting  that s what directors are for  and editors  which brings up another point
 who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory  if america s butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef  in spite of the near three hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie   not sequences  but single frames  creating a herky jerky effect that s nauseating to watch  maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the  s  if he was i can say he doesn t know how to do it
