the oscar season has arrived so this means a slew of these deep  engaging  powerhouse ensemble films are all over the movie theaters in hopes of gaining an audience and having the opportunity to earn best picture in the big show  among them is this film that is based off a very popular and well acclaimed play  the original playwright was actually the writer and director of the film adaptation  which comes as a double edged sword  on one hand  who better to translate the play than the original writer  on the other hand  who better to not see the mistakes and drawbacks of the play and fix upon them than the original writer himself  doubt mixes excellent acting and plenty of tension and suspense  with a frustrating ending  unnecessary dialogue  questionable directing  and of course  the inability to provide substantial answers  it is a growing trend among these  high caliber  films to not answer all questions it provides  and this has to stop   doubt is like a joke without its punch line  like a book with the final   pages missing  like losing reception while watching the fourth quarter of a hotly contested football game  and like not having the   cents to continue playing the arcade game and see what happens next  doubt  just like the previous best picture frustrationfest no country for old men  doesn t really end  it doesn t provide us with considerable answers nor does it deliver enough for us to figure out the ending  yes  that was the intent  but this isn t a test of humanity  it s a cop out  i do not pay money to see an unfinished work  i pay money to see a beginning  middle  and end  and pray that i don t fall asleep during the three acts  we are forced to become the  writers  of the movie by filling in the blank ourselves as to what happened before and what will happen to the characters we saw screaming at each other   this little drama is about a nun  meryl streep  who seems very sure that the well beloved priest  philip seymour hoffman  is making sexual advances towards a child that goes to the church  the first african american boy in the catholic church  the church is secretly torn as to whether or not he really is committing heinous sins behind everyone s backs  the plot thickens as some of the kids begin behaving differently  which attracts the notice of a young teacher  amy adams  the story is set right after the assassination of john f  kennedy  which shook the nation for quite some time and questioned their faith in humanity and in each other   doubt s strong points come in the acting ensemble and also the ever engaging suspense that builds slowly and never boils over  streep seems to be oscar worthy in every role she s in  and here she is no different as her sternness and cold hearted behavior places a blanket of fear in all the students and with some of the staff in the church  hoffman excels yet again as the priest  by successfully meshing suspicion with a charming personality and a friendly aura  the seemingly hypocritical personality is tough to pull off  especially when we are suppose to like him and also ponder about him at the same time  but hoffman steps up to the plate against one of the best actresses of our generation and fantastically delivers  when these two argue  you can hear the fireworks fly without ever seeing one launched  but let s not forget amy adams  enchanted  and viola davis  law ad order  for their superb job either  doubt s casting ensemble is among the best in    yet  like previously stated it s the writing and directing that ruins this film  especially when dwindling down the third act  questions pop up  but they aren t answered  characters pop up  but provide no real enhancement towards the plot  kids behave different  but we never truly find out why  there are awkward angles in the camera work
and
there s no actual reason why  john patrick shanley  the writer of the play  had one previous film in his directing repertoire  joe versus the volcano  whether sheer arrogance or stupidity  we are stuck with seeing overdrawn sequences of random conversation  utter annoying chatter that bores to no end  there was a two minute discussion about coffee and how much sugar the priest wanted  thanks to mr  shanley   bottom line  the lack of an ending is a stupid trend that s just as irritating as the seizureific camera work in action films  it doesn t matter that we have a great talented acting cast  or decent cinematography  or a good story being worked upon  or good usage of sound and music  because we have a barrage of unanswered questions that sprinkles all over a film that is over   minutes yet doesn t even finish  the translation from play to film is good and quite accurate  because we have the original madmen behind the project but he took the mistakes and stupid hiccups from the play to the film as well  this decade has seen its share of blockbuster and high profile films that could have gotten a much higher score from me if they had just decided to add a few more minutes of footage and actually end  sideways  cast away  no country for old men  burn after reading are a few examples   newsflash  end your stinkin  movie  please or at least provide a good amount of clues for us to easily fill in the blank  like wall e s depressing backstories  instead of staring into space as the credits suddenly start rolling and you are left with a feeling of emptiness  confusion  and mental anguish  have a beginning  middle  and the end please  as a critic  i prefer my films to be whole  not incomplete  doubt feels incomplete  which is why it gets an incompetent grade   someone has to break this stupid trend
