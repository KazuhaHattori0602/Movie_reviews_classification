what a terrible film   it starts well  with the title sequence  but that s about as good as it gets   the movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree  the acting isn t so much poor  but the script is pointless and the film isn t even scary despite the atmospheric music   it really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film   it isn t a good film  it s trash  and i urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it  one out of ten
