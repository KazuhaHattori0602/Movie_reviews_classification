this movie was rented by a friend  her choice is normally good  i read the cover first and was expecting a good movie  although it  was a horror movie  which i don t prefer  but no horror came to mind while watching the movie  it was a dull   not very entertaining movie  the appearance of denise richards  was again a pleasure for the eye  but that s it  we  the four of us   we re a little bit disappointed  but feel free to see this movie and  judge it yourself
