what s in here   let me tell you  it s the presence of  alec baldwin  he s not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them  he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after  so not to mention  literally   the matter of  steve mcqueen  being at the same role in the original because i don t want to make that comparison in the first place  i m not a big fan or even a fan of  kim basinger  she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average   and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty   well  if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i ll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible   and what is it with all the craziness over miss basinger s legs   it s surely insanity or bad tasting   as i don t see them both as not sexy only  but ugly too   and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what   i ve just watched this movie so i m dead already   yet  what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the most
and of course i mean  jennifer tilly now we re talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette  marilyn monroe  however much more healthier    i can t help it  she was the only new and watchable thing in here    michael madsen  as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys   james woods  is here to summarize the early events beside the pool  so the trailer would be by his voice later   and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood s stuff so  do your thing  take your cash  and good luck as an actor in other movies   the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography  so the main goods of it  the action  the thrill    are here and fairly well made  though any echo for deep meanings about  the kinds of betrayal  as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don t wait for it  ok  it s all in all another remake without anything special  except jennifer tilly s spicy moments   so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn t end my review saying that  basinger  or anyone here did better than this movie  it would be an insult because frankly  anything is better than this movie
