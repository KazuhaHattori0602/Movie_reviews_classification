the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of joeseph conrad s heart of darkness  the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a jeep and walter kurtz is osama   the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud to  take this fabricated death of a journalist and present it as factual  while some portions have muslims supporting the   attacks for the usa s treatment of muslims around the world    i alerted the video store that the movie should be removed from their  documentary  section and be placed in the war drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events
