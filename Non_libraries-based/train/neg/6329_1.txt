i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in    back when the tickets actually sold for   this is the only film i have ever walked out on  with my friend  while the idiocy that is the  laser bra   sketch was on screen  evidently  my and my friend s reaction to the film was a common one  it is not that i found the film offensive  either as an  year old or now  but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny  devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable  this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it  rather than a failure to comprehend mr  mike s  vision   unless  of course  his vision was to drive the film s backers into bankruptcy   i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published   worst films of all time  list  it certainly makes mine  you have been warned
