   like me  then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you ve seen before  many of the popular amateur artists on newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this dvd  if lynch submitted this work to the website  then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of newgrounds artists  but  since i saw this on dvd  instead of on newgrounds  i give it a   instead of a   as i would have otherwise  these cartoons are fit for the internet  but with a name like david lynch on it  i expected better quality both in story and in animation
