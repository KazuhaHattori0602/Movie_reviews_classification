is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor  the answer is yes  one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture  the premise is not too bad   a naive front man for an illegal business   but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not work   was this considered a good  b  in   hard to imagine  the only positive aspect of the picture is the cast  which contains several well known faces from the  s and  s  such as warren hymer  vince barnett and robert armstrong  i always dismiss richard cromwell as the weakling who got gary cooper killed in  lives of a bengal lancer  so i wasn t counting him   can t recommend this one and gave it a rating of     if you have a choice  get a root canal
