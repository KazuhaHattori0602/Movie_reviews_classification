   and ronald sipus  principal of the fundamentalist village christian school  which flemming attended as a boy   like michael moore s interview of charlton heston in bowling for columbine  his interview with sipus is so contentious that sipus walks out in the middle  in a sarcastic tone  flemming tells us how wrong christianity was wrong about the sun revolving around the earth  then points to atrocities committed in the name of christianity such as those by cult leader charles manson who killed   people and dena schlosser  who cut her baby s arm off for god  he also lifts a statement from a book by lahaye and jenkins that says that christians  look forward to the day when all non christians are thrown into a lake of fire  howling and screeching  to further turn us against christianity  flemming shows us extended clips from mel gibson s the passion of the christ  detailing in minute detail each scene of violence and torture  what could have been a serious discussion on a very interesting subject eventually becomes a childish rant and a polemic against all religion  in the process of condemning those who used christianity to commit unspeakable acts  he ignores such people as socialist muriel lester  a famous christian pacifist  rigoberta mench  tum  a mayan indian of guatemala who helped found the revolutionary christians and received the nobel peace prize in recognition of her work for social justice  and mother teresa  whose work was about respect for each individual s worth and dignity   his most telling argument is his comparison of christian doctrine with the pagan cults and he makes some good points  yet flemming does not tell us that while some aspects of these cults may resemble christian doctrines  there are no texts or source materials for these cults before  ad  long after the new testament  also it is important to note one major difference  the immediate goal of the initiates was a mystical experience that led them to feel they had achieved union with their god  this is anathema to christianity which believes that a church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the pope are required to interpret god s will to mankind   although i am not a christian and have some doubts about whether or not jesus christ was in fact a historical figure  the truth is that  in the long scheme of things  it may not matter  what matters is that a message was introduced to mankind and spread around the world that contributed to mankind s spiritual evolution  regardless of the distortions and crimes later committed in its name and there were many  christianity as conceived was a doctrine of compassion and love  and a moral and ethical code that furthered respect for our fellow man   while i applaud the fact that the film was made and that a taboo topic was discussed  what is sorely needed is not another divisive attempt to use religion as a field of combat but to see it as a common thread that can bring the world s people together  while there is room for debate and discussion on religious subjects  in the words of annie besant   spiritual truths are best seen in the clear air of brotherhood and mutual respect  the god who wasn t there is recommended only for those whose idea of a good time is to trash the religion of others
