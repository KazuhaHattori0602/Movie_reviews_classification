i see a lot of movies  saw the original wargames years ago and loved it  computers where still  a big mystery  for the most of us and the movie was convincing  in it s own way   this one  however  looks like a low budget wednesday night special  total crap  from start to finish   the plot is so weak  you won t believe it until you see the movie  which i would not recommend in the first place  i can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie  but hey  with that script i would ve been surprised if anyone could do a good job acting  lots of clich  scenes  cgi looks like it s taken out of the   version   bah  no  i m getting in a bad mood just writing about this  do not watch this movie   life s to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
