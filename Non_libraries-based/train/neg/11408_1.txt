this was just plain terrible  i read this book for school  i made as on all of the tests  and to see it like this  my teacher forced me and   other people to watch it  and it was worse than leonard part   plan   from outer space  and hudson hawk put together  the thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over  first of all  it was made on hallmark  second  the acting was terrible  third  it was like completely different from the book  literally  it was so bad i asked myself to be excused  basically  i would rather watch basic instinct   than watch this  take my advice  don t watch this film  no one would want to watch this  it was horrible  horrible
