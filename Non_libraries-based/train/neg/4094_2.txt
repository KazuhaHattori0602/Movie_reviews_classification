despite being released on dvd by blue underground some five years ago  i have never come across this italian  sword and sorcery  item on late night italian tv and  now that i have seen it for myself  i know exactly why  not because of its director s typical predilection for extreme gore  of which there is some examples to be sure  or the fact that the handful of women in it parade topless all the time  it is set in the dark ages after all 
it is  quite simply  very poor stuff indeed  in fact  i would go so far as to say that it may very well be the worst of its kind that i have yet seen and  believe me  i have seen plenty  especially in the last few years i e  following my excursion to the   venice film festival  reading about how the film s failure at the time of initial release is believed to have led to its director s subsequent  and regrettable  career nosedive into mindless low budget gore  i can see their point  i may prefer fulci s earlier  giallo  period   to his more popular stuff horror   myself but  even on the latter  his commitment was arguably unquestionable  on the other hand  conquest seems not to have inspired fulci in the least   seeing how he decided to drape the proceedings with an annoyingly perpetual mist  sprinkle it with incongruent characters  cannibals vs  werewolves  anyone  irrelevant gore  we are treated to a gratuitous  nasty cannibal dinner just before witnessing the flesh eating revelers having their brains literally beaten out by their hairy antagonists  and even some highly unappetizing intimacy between the masked  brain slurping villainess  don t ask  and her slimy reptilian pet  for what it is worth  we have two heroes for the price of one here  a young magic bow carrying boy on some manhood affirming odyssey  andrea occhipinti  and his rambling muscle bound companion  jorge rivero i e  frenchy from howard hawks  rio lobo [ ]  who  despite being called mace  short for maciste  perhaps  seems to be there simply to drop in on his cavewoman from time to time and get his younger prot g  out of trouble  particularly during an exceedingly unpleasant attack of the  boils  unfortunately  even the usual saving grace of such lowbrow material comes up short here as ex goblin claudio simonetti s electronic score seems awfully inappropriate at times  fulci even contrives to give the film a laughably hurried coda with the surviving beefy hero going aimlessly out into the wilderness  after defeating one and all with the aid of the all important magic bow
so much for his own supposed physical strength  onto his next   and thankfully unfilmed   adventure
