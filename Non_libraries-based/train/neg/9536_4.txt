best of the best   is better than   but just barely  basically  i say this because part   doesn t contradict parts    like   does   ie  their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings   anyway  i liked the russian plot line of the story  and especially sven ole thorsen s bit part as boris  aside from that though and a few fighting scenes  the movie is nothing special  the limited budget is also very noticeable  especially in the airplane blow up scene   also  part   does not really have a moral or say anything like part   did  there are a couple of more better known actors  hudson  thorsen  in part   but alas nothing like the beginning of the series  and even these characters have very small roles   alas  it seems best of the best is the rhee show  and to be truthful  he cannot carry a movie   saw on tape  rating
