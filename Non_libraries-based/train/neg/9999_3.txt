this is the kind of movie that my enemies content i watch all the time  but it s not bloody true  i only watch it once in a while to make sure that it s as bad as i first thought it was   some kind of mobsters hijack a boeing    that  at least  is an improvement over having boeing hijack a good part of the pentagon  the airplane goes down in the bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms  a kind of post facto submarine   it has one of those all star casts  the stars either falling or barely above the horizon    we re on our own  says pilot jack lemon  he is so right  except for george kennedy  he s in all these disaster movies   watch another movie instead  oh  not  airport  the original  that s no good either  instead  watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like  flight of the phoenix
