i am not sure who is writing these  glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks  i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about  min long and believe me that is all i could take  plot is terrible  acting is even worse  and there is no development at all   even the david cocteau films are better than this  run away from jigsaw   i expected to hate the acting  which can be forgiven in direct to video movies  if the plot is good   this had no scares  very little gore   and a truly unattractive cast   i watched this with three other friends  who i hope are still talking to me   they wanted me to fling the disc out the window  i can not believe anyone could have  given this tripe a good review
