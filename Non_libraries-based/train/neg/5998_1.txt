the basic formula for the original series was  take someone  get the audience to like them  then put them into mortal danger  this formula worked for the   episodes made between     now  we jump forward   years to   we are introduced to alan tracy  a somewhat less than diligent college school kid  with his friend  fermat  a young know it all  they are whisked off by lady penelope in her pink ford thunderbird to the island paradise where the tracy family live  for the school holidays  almost immediately  they are left in the care of kyrano and his daughter  tin tin whilst the adults go to rescue john from thunderbird   which has been damaged by a staged accident  this is all part of the hood s scheme to take over tracy island so that he can steal the thunderbird machines    
to rob a bank   yes  the plot is as limp as that   the dialogue is banal  the acting more wooden than that of the  fibreglass  puppets  the effects  anything but special and hans zimmer s score
  what little there was of barry gray s glorious theme shone through zimmer s lackluster orchestration  the rest of the score was eminently forgettable  in fact  part of the score was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn t recognise it  i didn t even bother to stay to witness busted s mediocre efforts with the end titles  to be fair  ron cook worked quite well as parker  he and sophia myles as penelope seemed wasted  with the right material  they could have been show stoppers  the cgi work was what i would have called leading edge     years ago   the dynamics of the main craft were just wrong  the original series models at least moved as if they had mass  another sore point is that the whole production seemed to be one long set of product placements  from every vehicle being built by ford to the entire content of the tracy freezer being produced by ben   jerry s   my son   enjoyed the film but this cross between spy kids and  clockstoppers  aimed squarely at his age group  added nothing to the thunderbirds legend  when star trek hit the big screen in   with  the motion picture  a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise which then continued for another   years or so  with this film  frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with the thunderbirds franchise   i predict that this film  like  the avengers  and  the saint  before it  will sink into obscurity within   months  leaving the original series to its  classic  status
