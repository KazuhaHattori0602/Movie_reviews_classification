i dug this out and watched it tonight  i honestly think it must be   years since the last time i saw it  i remember it being a seriously flawed film  i don t remember it being this bad   i am absolutely aghast that a project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly  who am i to blame for this  the   guys who wrote  and i use that word loosely  the script  the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least   major characters in the story   only   of them are among  the amazing   the director  who clearly refused to take it seriously  and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing   bad acting everywhere   i liked the theme song  but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film  don black  who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music   it figures that i should pull this out  less than a week after re reading the comic book adaptation  the first   minutes of the film more or less  really  less  parallel the first issue of the comic  as i watched it tonight  i kept wondering  why was almost every single detail changed  doc showing up  then using his wrist watch remote control to open the safe  and the sniper s bullet missing him by   inches because the refractive glass  were just about the only things left the same  i mean  if you re gonna do an  adaptation  why in god s name change everything   once they leave doc s hq  virtually nothing is as it was in the comic  which  given roy thomas  i figure probably follows the book  i read somewhere they actually combined elements of   different novels into one movie  again  why  i ve heard it was changed because they weren t able to secure the kind of budget they wanted  i look at the film  and think  lack of money in no way explains what i saw on the screen   you know  when people complain about joel schumacher  they should really take a look at this thing  the best thing i can say is  i think it would make a great double feature with the   batman feature  and probably a great triple bill with that and the   flash gordon  all   films are  silly  maybe we can  blame  the   film  and tv series  for this  some fans have complained over the years that adam west s batman ruined the image of comic books in the minds of generations of non comics fans  i think the same could be said for hollywood  i m reminded of how many really  really bad films based on  classic  characters have been made over the years  especially  it seems to me  in the late  s   early  s  charlie chan  fu manchu  tarzan  buck rogers  flash gordon  the lone ranger  all  murdered  by hollywood types who think   oh  comic books  so you know it s supposed to be stupid  more like they re the  stupid  ones  what a waste of potential   let me say some good things  despite the script and the directing  ron ely is great  when i read a doc savage story  i don t think of the james bama paintings  i think of ely  bill lucking  who later was a regular on the a team  is terrific  eldon quick  who i ve seen somewhere else  but can t recall where  is terrific  paul gleason  who i absolutely hated with a passion and a vengeance in the breakfast club  teachers  like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere  may be the best of the  amazing   in the film  pamela hensley  though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story  is terrific  before she let her hair down  i also realized she looked a hell of a lot like  ardala valmar  from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips i just read the other day  she s got a big nose like ardala  only not quite as pronounced  the comics ardala actually looked more like the   movie princess aura  or cher  or maybe streisand  take yer pick   ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips  after  she was stunning   paul wexler  funny enough  i saw just last week in a get smart episode  i wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing  i don t know  because that character sure wasn t in the movie the film takes its title from
