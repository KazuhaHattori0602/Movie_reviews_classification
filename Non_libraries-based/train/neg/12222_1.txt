 honestly  barbra  i know it s you who s klicking all those  no s on my review    times  how many people did you have to instruct to help you out here  don t you have anything better to do  like look at yourself in the mirror all day   steven spielberg told barbra that this was  the best movie i ve seen since  citizen kane  that pretty much says it all   and serves as a dire warning   what are the ingredients for a sure fire cinematic disaster  and one that will haunt you  never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain  the ingredients  barbra streisand s face  a musical  feminism  barbra streisand s voice  barbra streisand directing  and an ultra corny idiotic premise   hollywood is full of egomaniacs  this much we know  in fact  nearly everyone   by definition   has to be an egomaniac in hollywood  why would anyone want to act  for the  art  well  if you re dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews
 and streisand has the biggest ego of them all  this is quite an achievement  to be surrounded by narcissistic cretins  and yet to manage to top them all   remarkable   the movie  like all her  solo  endeavors  is an ego trip straight out of hell  every scene streisand is in is automatically ruined  stillborn  but as it that weren t enough  she sings a whole bunch of streisandy songs   you know  the kind that enabled the mariah careys  the celine dions  and the whitney hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades now  just for that she deserves not one but   south park episodes mocking her   the premise  streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi  sounds like a zany zaz comedy  apart from it being a clich  the obvious problem is that streisand doesn t look like a woman nor does she look like a man   in fact i m not even sure she s human  the way she looks in this movie  well
 it cannot be described in words  e t  looks like a high school jock by comparison  she looks more alien than michael jackson in the year   she looks horrible   the songs  they made me shiver  particularly  papa can you hear me squeel like a demented female walrus in heat  and  tomorrow night i ll prepare the sequel  yentl   the return of the bitch   did you know that streisand considered having a nose job early on in her career  but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change  can you believe that  she should have done it  killing two flies with one swipe  that s what it would have been   if you re interested in reading my biographies of barbra streisand and other hollywood intellectuals  contact me by e mail   should barbra streisand finally go into retirement  click  yes  or  no
