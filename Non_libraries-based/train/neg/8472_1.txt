the movie opens upon julian sands  lying on his back  a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it  about two feet above him  that was so provocative  and i thought   here we go  a good vampire movie    and then it died  that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination  it was slow  uneventful drivel thereafter  i was vastly disappointed  as my previous experience with sands  acting was quite enjoyable  however  this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired   even julian sands s questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie   it rates a   from   the fiend
