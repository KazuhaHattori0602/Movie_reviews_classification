already his first claim  that desires are always artificial  is totally fallacious   when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies   or anything for that matter   it s time for anyone to get their own  although far  far more intelligent than  say  paris hilton  i know  not too difficult  zizek s mouth spews just as much baloney as hers  just a different kind  he combines the worst from both his professional worlds  psychoanalysis and philosophy  both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert b lls osopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories  to rant without a beginning or end  and to connect concepts almost randomly  in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love  example  there are three main marx brothers hence what a  great  idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness  the id  the ego and the super ego  i m kind of surprised he didn t play a clip from  snowhite  and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah  moslem hell  it s like the premise of schumacher s  the number   play with numbers long enough  and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want  even linking ancient greeks with princess di s death   however  there is an entertainment element to tpgtc  watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun  why watch  cuckoo s nest  or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than   hours  it s like watching an amusing train wreck  admittedly  he is almost funny on one or two occasions   i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate movie making into an exalted intellectual social science  giving idiotic movies like  birds  this much thought  hence this much credit  probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave  the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value  and the few ones that do have some intelligence don t require a shrink turned philosopher to draw one a map to understand them   unless one is a complete idiot  zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies  hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days   when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the  psycho  shower scene  i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes  how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leigh s blood  or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leigh s vagina  with the blood flowing into it instead of out  as in menstruation  this representing some kind of  clever  zizekian  irony  speaking of which  the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene  and the script  his movies wouldn t have been the illogical  far fetched crap that they often are  the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about  hidden  deep meanings  and when you add zizek s fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology  layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations  you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated   i e  the easily impressionable and the gullible   zizek utters a number of  unintentionally  funny things here  one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkins s cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with  the satisfaction of work  of a job well done  don t laugh  neither hitchcock nor the writer of  psycho  could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done   the cleaning of a blood stained toilet   while they were conceiving directing that scene  talk about putting words into one s  dead  mouth  but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to  say   i like zizek s initial thoughts on tarkovsky s terrific  solaris  but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in  anti feminism  and other nonsense into his theory   zizek s attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone   i just want to play with it all day  logic has its rules  and is not supposed to be raped   at least not publicly   by the likes of him  he seems to regard logic  proof  common sense  and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys  concepts to be either avoided  twisted to fit the end goal  or simply annihilated  zizek is the lsd tripped hippie  and all his favorite movies are his own personal  s   the fact that zizek over focuses on two of the most overrated directors   and ones whose films often lack intelligence  if anything   such as hitchcock and lynch  only further diminishes his already low credibility  i was surprised de palma didn t feature more prominently  that s another lame director who writes inept scripts  zizek has a field day with lynch s incomprehensible  lost highway  there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it   zizek s comment that the viewer readily accepts von trier s laughable   ground breaking  physical set up in  dogville  made me snicker    however  zizek doesn t only make up stuff as he goes along  he also indulges heavily in the  bleedin  obvious  like all  social scientists   an oxymoron  he wraps his very trite  observations  into articulate  if full of spitting  and sometimes complex blankets of language  after all  sociology functions in precisely the same way  it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact it s what we already all know  but told in an eloquent way   which fools the more unobservant listener   i was half expecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a loonie suit   slavoj zizek  soon as a stalker in a kid s park near you
