this movie has such inexorable b class cheapness to all its scenes  effects etc as to make you think they spent   of their budget on connery  it s like watching some wing commander stuff after star wars  quite apart from content   story can be described in one word  flat  and oh my god i can t remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago  we re given neither a reason he s so wicked  an inborn defect  we re lead to think  nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickedness   if you re out for connery rather go rent `hunting forrester
