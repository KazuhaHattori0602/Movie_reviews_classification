i rented this movie about   years ago  and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made  i don t think i ever finished it  it is worse than a home video made by a high school student  i remember them doing a flashback to   something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt  oakley sunglasses and a newer suv  like a toyota rav  or something  i don t remember  i don t understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the  s  he might have had a cell phone too  i cant remember  it was just horrible  i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back  to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen some pretty bad ones
