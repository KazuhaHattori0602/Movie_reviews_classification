i m a horror gore movie freak and this flick was so bad  i felt embarrassed for not only the  actors  but also the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money up for this schlock   from the title  you d expect some great carnage  somewhat of a storyline and at least some direction or dialog  instead  you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual three stooges episode  at least i laugh at the three stooges  while watching this crap  i turned another tv on and started watching howard stern until something interesting happened   needless to say  i kept watching stern   watching this  film  i realize that i could produce a film with three monkeys    dv cameras    dollars in loose change and a broken pc  this film is my inspiration to get into no budget film making  watch this movie if you dare  but be warned there is a lot of nothing in here but a whole lot of talking and very little action  this makes  kazaam  look like a meryl streep film   i m sure germany didn t ban it due to sex or violence  other countries need to take heed
