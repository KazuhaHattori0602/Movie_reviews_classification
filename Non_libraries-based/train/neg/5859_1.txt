turkish cinema has a big problem  directors aren t interested in global cinema  they are local and folkloric  but want to be international  this brings kitsch results such this movie   film has jokes translated to spanish from turkish and they don t have any meaning for non turkish audiences  even for turkish audiences after   years   players  even ferhan sensoy have a worse acting than average  they act like puppets   movie was shot in cuba  but nothing includes about cuba  so cuba is thought like a banana republic   waste of money  waste of time
