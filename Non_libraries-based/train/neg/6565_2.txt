this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a parasite of hollywood  bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry   vidhu vinod chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of  deewar  and  on the waterfront  will bring home an oscar  it turned out to be rookie mistake   even the idea of the title is inspired from the elia kazan classic  in the original  brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace   bollywood must move out of hollywood s shadow if it needs to be taken seriously
