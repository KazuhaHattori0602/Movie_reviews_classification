you know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie  well this was beyond that  i bought the dvd at tower records because it was like   and i d heard this was a movie you could laugh at  it is really nothing short of pathetic  about   minutes into the movie  my friends started asking me to turn it off  around   minutes they begged me  after an hour  we compromised to fast forward to the end  so we could see how the conflict was resolved  and because we had been watching the whole time for matt walsh  seriously  don t watch this movie  it is beyond painful
