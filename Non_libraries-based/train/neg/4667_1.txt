visually cluttered  plot less  incredibly mind numbing rubbish  not even close to greenaway s better work  avoid at all costs   the overlapping  split screen  effects do nothing more than confuse  the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the  artistic  composing of images is pretentious in the extreme   there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film  even the nudity is incredibly unerotic  which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring   plus  how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me  he showed more ability in the star wars series  and that s saying something   i ve not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw  darby o gill and the little people
