i was utterly disappointed by this movie  i had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations  i expected a drama with more intense character development  but that never happens in the movie  daniel day lewis is a good actor  but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe  i tought he repeated the same set of   or   movements in the movie  i would rate his performance   out of    acting    out of   direction is   out of   script is the worst    out of     i deleted the movie from my dvr at   mins  into the movie  much better movies out there than this
