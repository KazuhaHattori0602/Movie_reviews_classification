omg this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot i m a film student  i don t understand why angelina jolie would be in this movie  did she need the money that badly  i love aj and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this   tick another one off  it was soo bad  not even good bad  just bad bad  it had   or   funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of   minutes  i cant even say aj looked good in it because well she didn t  the plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re telling of romeo and juliet then its not  all round disappointing  maybe if your   this could be a good film otherwise i really don t recommend it
