cavemen was by far the biggest load of crap i have ever wasted my time watching  this show based on the geico commercials is less entertaining then an actual   sec ad for geico  the makeup was half ass ed to say the least  hard to imagine a caveman with prefect white teeth even after going to the dentist  this show could of had potential for a funny series if they could of gotten the cast from the commercials  that in it self makes for a lousy show  perhaps if the writers were the same from the geico ads this may of had a chance  instead the pilot lacked a good story line  i give this show a   out of   i would of liked to put a zero out of   but that was not an option  i pray for a quick death to this show  i d give it less then   episodes before it dies a deserving death
