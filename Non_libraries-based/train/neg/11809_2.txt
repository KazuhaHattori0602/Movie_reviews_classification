bought this movie in the bargain bin at rogers video store for   i enjoy a good b movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one   the movie is quite cliche  s  and is quite groovy for that  unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie  in fact  i turned it off after watching it for   minutes and figured a week later that i should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was   the movie has good spots in it  but you have to wait and wait and wait for them   if you are into b movies  this might just be for you  just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens  and did i mention not much story line either
