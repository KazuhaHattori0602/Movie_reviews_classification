honestly  i can t be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence   life is simply too short  what i will say is that  alone in the dark succeeds in only three things    it will make you laugh  but for all the wrong reasons    it manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them   and    it utterly disgraces the classic pc game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film making   doctor boll  if that is indeed what you are  i m thinking proctology here  what on earth are you doing in a director s chair
