quite unimpressive  the  twists  are all pretty predictable  if you ve seen any movies within the last ten years  and the few somewhat interesting parts  wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision  are few and lack much punch  since the  secret  has already been shown before these clues are explained    spoilers  sorta   the acting is decent enough  the story simply isn t very interesting  the whole  still awake  premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff not kidding    the surgery scene is initially tense  a bit discomforting  but then becomes utterly banal   not horrible  but not memorable  terrence howard s least interesting role to date  so far as i ve seen    kind of boring  overall
