i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf  and before i got my first vcr i figured i d christen it with this little gem and it s bad film making at it s finest   the dialog is inadvertently hilarious  and it contains a cameo with donald trump  anthony quinn is in it inexplicably  and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years  this movie is mr  quinn s country bears   it features lines like   shut up and let me fight   and  you re saying a lot of sh_it    and the priceless comeback   unfortunately it is sh_it  tough angry sh_it   you ll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table  and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll  chop socky action and t and a thrills   what schlock movie fan could ask for more  oh  and when mr  quinn s character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness  he says   real men don t eat quiche   uh  aaa  yeah  if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there
