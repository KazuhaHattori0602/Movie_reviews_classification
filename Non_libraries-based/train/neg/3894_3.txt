the incredible melting man plays like an extended episode of the six million dollar man  but with violence and some nudity  i know this film is a bit crummy but i found it impossible not to kind of like it   the acting and script are not the best  but the effects are good for a   year old movie with a budget of     the title character takes quite a while to actually melt but when he does it s reasonably impressive  we also have one inventive death scene involving electrocution  of note too is the music  it s insane   a cheese tastic medley of nonsense   notable highlights      marvel at the slow motion nurse who jumps through a pane of glass for absolutely no reason whatsoever     be amazed by a day in the life of a severed head     beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid  called steve     be astonished when our hero takes a break from hunting the melting lunatic to have a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen   this film is just too  s for me to hate it  it s tacky and trashy but i thought it was a lot of fun  you could do a lot worse
