  so i can release my thoughts of discontent about it   i ve decided to watch the movie a second time  aaargh   how bad can a script and a director be  this bad  here are the awful scenes in chronological order   in the early scenes we see henry  who doesn t realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead glazed stare is dead   the movie doesn t explain anything about the blonde long haired kid who like to bite people   and my answer to marcy s unanswered question  what s wrong with the woods  is  nothing  the script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for  suspense   then the  smartest  of the  pack  bert  almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire  he meets now infected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the  f word  bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill  bert don t make me shoot you   he forgets to add   with my bb gun   bert heads back to the cabin but how about that  he meets marcy and jeff who were having sex  but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk  marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire bert had started earlier  a moment of clarity for a change  bert doesn t mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his bb gun   later  as the five estupidos sit around their campfire  another weirdo shows up with his dog   maybe that s what the warning about the woods is all about  it s filled with weirdos and their dogs  they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis   their brains are completely intoxicated  no wonder why they are all so dumb  this is the last time we ll see this forgettable character alive   henry shows up at their cabin   note  he was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin  looking worse  almost like a zombie  covered in goo  he says he needs a doctor  but the young einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker  he gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition  henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard  seats and windows  the fantastic five come out running  armed with  a bb gun  a knife  a baseball bat  huh  ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods  a poker  and a  insecticide  spray can  ready to combat the single  unarmed and terribly sick man   clever script  bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his bb gun  which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth   what else am i supposed to do  bert yells in his defense  jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck s windows instead  henry walks up to the dumb girls who say   he s coming towards us   thanks for the info  dumb broads  i can see that  but i don t think he wants to do you any harm  marcy sprays in his eyes  making henry yelp  and our  hero  paul touches henry s arm with a burning log from the campfire  which they recklessly left burning while they were inside the cabin   where has all that wisdom gone  i guess the cannabis had started to take its toll  henry turns into the human torch and runs away  screaming   the following day  bert and jeff head out for a mechanic  and marcy decides to  go for help  all by herself  in the woods  as paul stays behind with karen doesn t that sound idiotic  marcy could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already  going for help   i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see marcy in a canoe rowing over a huge and winding river  how did she get a canoe  does she even know where she s going  anyway  she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and  like in most horror movies  walks inside the cabin saying hello  is anyone there  bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her  and me at first  and along comes jeff  as well  how did they get here  did they swim across the river  do you see how brainless the script is   deputy winston meets paul at the cabin  he somehow doesn t notice the blood on their truck  this happens around   minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out   before i take my own eyes out now  that s funny   if you liked this movie  do yourself a favor and watch  fright night   the lost boys  or  the return of the living dead  then you ll see they are more entertaining than this thing  even the  toxic avenger part   which is also a lousy film  is way more funnier than  cabin fever
