up until this new season i have been a big  little mosque  fan  however  the new season had absolutely ruined it   the new christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show  it has always been about living together to overcome prejudice  the new vicar ruins that premise and shows christians in a very bad light   i am neither christian or muslim  but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between amar and the reverend  not any more   just cancel it and be done with it  it s not worth watching any more   it might still be saved  but a lot of change would need to be made   bring back the old format
