there are some bad movies out there  most of them are rather fun   criminally insane   was one of those flicks  so bad that it was enjoyable and had re watch value to it   criminally insane   has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me  that s saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst  but trust me  this was just completely awful and running just   hour is   hour too long   the movie has a rather incoherent storyline  but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn t being fed  well  you don t see that in this movie  except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one  the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there  but nothing happens until the last   minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep   the camera work in this movie is just atrocious  this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was   the sound quality is something else as you can t understand a word most of the characters are saying  to give an example of how bad it is  go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers  that is what this movie sounds like  not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood   now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can t describe just how bad this movie is  if you don t believe me  see it for yourself
