i read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private ryan i was expecting a film of some substance   the film starts off very lob sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being  but immediately it s   and you are not sure where everyone is  the accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be hawaiian asian american but everyone speaks in a very poor take on harvard english imitation of a japanese person   i gave this film   out of   as after   minutes i couldn t watch any more of it  the characters were   dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people i had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them  very poor direction of a very average tv movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel  i d avoid and look out for better efforts   this is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling  you got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie  my advice  avoid and watch band of brothers  tuskegee airmen  glory or any other movie like when trumpets fade
