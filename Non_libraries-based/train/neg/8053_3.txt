as a premise  this backwoods version of the dead calm storyline had promise   however  director eric red s inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors   ultimately  the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline  intermittent spates of ham fisted over direction are similarly distracting   charles dance  doing an  inbred backwoods hardass  schtick  does his best to save the movie  but ultimately  undertow squeals like a pig   and has more ham to boot
