no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser s flashman papers than i am   i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash  since i also see he had made the three four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well   not so royal flash   i was   years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time  and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel  i still am  but he was never really given a chance after that   what a disappointment  i saw it once again when i was about   on television and it seemed even worse   none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen  the comedy of flashman s character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do  the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic   looking back with more mature eyes  the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda   if you have read the book and not seen the film  i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented  russian roulette   a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about   my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently  but i am glad i have not   if by any chance fraser ever reads this  i can only say i think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation  but  based on my appreciation of that corpus of work  it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film  as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films
