the first   minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote  poised to flick around to watch something else  the premise of two writers  down on their luck  living in a self storage space  bin  was mildly amusing  but  painfully bland   the introduction of the character  played by joe pantoliano   the big deal movie guy  that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory  offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes  and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director   borderline nymphomaniac  added a bit of spice  her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye candy inclusion   ultimately  the obvious low budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes  stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments  some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget  whithnail   i being one that also deals with   guys with a dream  but down on their luck   however  for my money  the actors save tinseltown from the  terrible movie  archives and just about nudges it into the  could have been a cult movie  archives  i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantoliano s character  in particular  the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich d  but still funny  rich but screwed up characters house  where the story unravels towards it s final moments   i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film makers did their best to translate this to celluloid  it simply didn t work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners  i think the first   minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything   unless you re stuck for a novelty coffee coaster  don t pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket
