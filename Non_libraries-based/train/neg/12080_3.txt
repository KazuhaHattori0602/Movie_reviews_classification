i m a fan of both shakespeare and mst k  so i waited anxiously to see this episode  i ll comment on the movie first  then the mst k episode  the recipe for this movie  take talented actors  rich and beautiful shakespeare material  and a   budget  mix well  then drain of all life and movement  until dull and lifeless  serve cold in a big  plain stone cauldron  movie  i give   out of   because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit  okay  now the mst k episode  i ll admit it  the first time i saw it  i fell asleep halfway through  i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well  however  when i watched it a second time  i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around  the trick with this episode is  listen carefully  it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line  give it a second chance  and you ll see what i mean  mst k episode      out of
