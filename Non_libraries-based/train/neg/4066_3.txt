in director eric stanze s  isoyc  ipoyg  three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused  the first victim is forced to eat his own crap  before being axed to death  the next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy s corpse  but it s the third man who gets it the worst  he has to watch the heavily tattooed  star  emily haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle  oh  he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too   and  unfortunately  so do we  get to see her masturbate  that is not get a broom handle up our butts   yes   isoyc  ipoyg  is one harsh viewing experience  not because of its relentless violence  but because haack  who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess  as opposed to that of a roadie for metallica  constantly gets buck naked for the camera  it ain t a pretty sight   in addition to the non stop nudity from an inked up haack  viewers also get to see dreadful direction from stanze  who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff  some really bad acting  and a fat guy s penis   strangely enough  i give  isoyc  ipoyg  a rating of   which is actually slightly higher than its current   average  that s one point for the messy axe attack  which  being a gore hound  i actually enjoyed  one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces  hilarious  and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to meir zarchi s superior exploitation classic i spit on your grave
