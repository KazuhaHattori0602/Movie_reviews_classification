the question  when one sees a movie this bad  is not necessarily   how did a movie this bad get made  or even   why did i see this awful in the first place  but   what have i learned from this experience  here s what i learned     just because the  rules  of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn t mean someone won t go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them  without a shred of humor or irony     if your movie has to be described as  loosely  based on the video game  you have script problems     the black character may not always die first  but the asian character does always know kung fu     while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the  the matrix effect  on a budget  that doesn t necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea     being ron howard s brother does not guarantee choice roles     whenever a scene doesn t edit together  just use some footage from the video game  no one will notice     if your cousin s rap metal band offers to write your movie s theme for free  politely decline     zombie movies are not about people killing zombies  they re about zombies killing people  preferably in the most gruesome way possible  that s what makes them scary     white people who can pay   to get to a rave deserve to die     if you find an old book  it will tell you everything you need to know  anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks   what was that  or   where are we     bare breasts are not horror movie panacea     a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from  student film  to  major studio release  try it     just because you can name drop all three  living dead  movies  that does not make you george romero  or even paul w  s  anderson   i ve seen worse movies  but only because i ve seen  mortal kombat  annihilation
