this is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really  really sucks  i normally sanctify stuff like this  early  s grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky low budget atmosphere usually rock   house of seven corpses  appeared to dispose of even more trumps  since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans  including john carradine  john ireland and faith domergue  and the filming locations  the titular house  the graveyard  are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror  the film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences  though sadly enough they re the only ones that qualify as such  the credits are a splendid montage  complete with freakish color effects and eerie freeze frames  illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation  the last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments  someone falls down the balcony screaming  a lady drowns in her bathtub  and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux  needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker mr  price  carradine  only fortify this reputation  in other words  the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director eric hartman  john ireland  to shoot his satanic horror film project  the film within film structure is what mainly causes  house of seven corpses  to be so boring and uneventful  a lot of movie material is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or   even worse   faith domergue and charles macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes  the plot finally gets a little interesting  only a little  mind you  when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard  the asthmatic  judging by the noises he produces  zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew  reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses  after a running time of approximately   minutes  the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing  i m still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die  for some reason  i honestly regret confirming  house of seven corpses  is a pretty dreadful movie  the locations and scenery are gloomy chilling  but not nearly used to full effect and there s a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed  numerous low budgeted  s gems were stunningly gross  so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film within film murders really don t count  even the always reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and harrison s direction is completely uninspired  not recommended  unless you think the zero cool four and a half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy
