i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what s up tiger lily with this film   it has to be one of the worst french films i ve seen in a long time  actually along with brotherwood of the wolves    horrendous films in a much too short period of time   it s really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun  antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings  i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film   lou doyon is quite bad  as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don t necessarily give you talent   avoid this film  if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d artagnan
