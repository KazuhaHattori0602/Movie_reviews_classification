i found this movie in the  horror  section of my video store  that seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there  from romero s  dead  trilogy to   days later  however upon watching it  you can quickly see what this movie really is   it is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory  there is no horror here folks  just some half way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last  and last  and last  and soon you get the feeling maybe you re dvd player accidentally skipped back   minutes  but no  this is how they actually made the movie  it s a pity  i think anyone could find a better use for   million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o  crud  though some of the   effects were cool  but once again  they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time  just with a different character   also what is royally annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game  i ve played the game  it sucks  so why did they put it in here  oh that s right  this isn t a movie but a music video  and it s a poor one at that     rated r  a lot of violence gore  and profanity
