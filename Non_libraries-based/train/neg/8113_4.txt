popeye and big foot   popeye s engine company   getting popeye s goat    i used to lap these up as a kid but  catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back to back now i e  several years later  they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn raiders of the seven seas [ ]  i can see how they don t hold up all that well  the character of popeye isn t exactly sympathetic to begin with  olive oyl distinctly overbearing and bluto s antics failed to elicit much interest either   in short  the scripts were alarmingly thin  fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot  they re strictly juvenile fare  yet i doubt today s kids would even have the patience to stick with them  furthermore  the animation style is unattractive   taking each short per se  i guess they improved from one to the other  after the initial shock  one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were  so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot   popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief  hardly original  i know  but always an amusing ploy  one interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience
