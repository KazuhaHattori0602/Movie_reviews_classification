 you re not going to shoot those little creatures  in the first place  they haven t done you any harm  in the second place  they may be radioactive  ah  the joys of no budget  s sci fi
 yet despite the odd gem like that  superman and the mole men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean  minute running time  it s beyond cheap  the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation  and pretty dull with it  though it has a surprisingly altruistic message   the mute mole men  diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters  released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious  merely misunderstood  and george reeves  man of steel tries to prevent the local small town mob led by jeff corey from killing them  an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day  perhaps  but with little more than good intentions to recommend it
