welcome to movie   on the chilling classics   pack  where we ll see  that s right  another movie that makes absolutely no sense  seriously  this movie had me so confused at the end  i thought i was rewatching  at dawn they sleep  the plot seems simple enough well that is until   seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then um  explodes  i have no idea what happened  and that was before the title screen  that s really sad when i can t even tell what happened in the first   minutes   anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere  so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it   feet out of the way towards a town  suspicious  nah  so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady  and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking  the guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to  he gets lost and then finds his way back   oh  i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless   minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca  then they leave  there s really no point to this scene  it s really just padding  if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared   but sadly  that was actually the best part of the movie  wait  let me rephrase that  really sadly that was the best part of the movie  because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on imdb to find out what happened  but of course no one else knows so i m sol    seriously  the last   minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i ve ever seen on film  they dressed her up in a dress  he gets kidnapped  then released  he runs back to the house  then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends  seriously  i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie  i mean  as bad as movies such as  war of the robots  are  at least they make sense  this movie doesn t even make the attempt to be coherent  the ending was as confusing as the end of  at dawn they sleep  and the plot was much more boring  this movie gets a   just for its sheer  i have no idea what happened in this movie ness   witches mountain  gets   confused movie watcher out of
