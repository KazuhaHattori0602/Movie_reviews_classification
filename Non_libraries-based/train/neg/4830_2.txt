really  really  i know if you make a political war movie you will get noticed but this movie was just garbage  horrible in every sense  terribly inaccurate in so many ways  i have an easier time believing the president of the united states suiting up  flying a jet fighter  and shooting down aliens  it is easier to note the few things that were right  my jaw dropped when i saw some one say that this movie was the best in the last   years  it was overacted  seemingly pointless plot diversions  and had questionable cinematography at times   x box  youtube  acupat utilities
 did anyone check that these things did not exist in   it s not like you had to do extensive research  it was only five years before this movie came out  i am an iraq war veteran and if you spent one day with an infantry platoon or an eod squad you would realize how b s  this movie is  to compare this to platoon or saving private ryan is ludicrous  why don t you just throw commando and red dawn in there too  i think those might be more accurate    if for some reason you can see past the unbelievable plot  the historical and factual discrepancies  then this movie might just be ok  nothing more  if you keep on hearing  oscar buzz  and have to add your own pompous review  go right ahead  as for me  i am writing the director to see if i can get my   minutes back
