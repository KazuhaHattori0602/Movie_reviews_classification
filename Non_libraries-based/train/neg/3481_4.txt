may contain spoilers   i say that  but anyone savvy enough to be reading this can probably figure out every plot turn right from the start   this is not a movie that i liked  i didn t hate it in the way of some movies that insult your intelligence  but it all felt too predictable on its trudge to the requisite happy ending  there were funny bits along the way to be sure  but few were original  at least it didn t go for the gutter   christina applegate looks fresh  and ben affleck works hard  their scenes together are actually the only redeeming feature  everyone else is a cardboard cutout  including  surprisingly  james gandolfini  who must have made this as a favor to someone   all in all  it s a harmless  but not inspiring    minutes
