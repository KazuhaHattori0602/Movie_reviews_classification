one stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and  to be kind  acting of less than oscar caliber  but to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft  and especially a   some of the major blunders     no flight engineer  or even a flight engineer station    mis identifying the f  interceptors as f s  no resmblance whatsoever    loading passengers into an  aft baggage compartment  supposedly accesible from the cabin   even if such a compartment existed  placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable    hollow point bullets that  won t damage the aircraft    the entire landing procedure was so bad i wanted to puke    an sr   of all planes  with a pressure seal hatch   opening a cabin door outward   into the wind   in flight   ah nuts  it was just a truly lousy movie  gotta make the list of bottom   of the year
