aka  mondays in the sun  i have no idea what i just watched  three men wander aimlessly and drink  grousing about everything and at everyone in their path  this is supposed to be a drama  but what it is  is a total waste of film  without a single redeeming quality   i have read reviews touting the performances herein as  wonderful   beautiful  and  heroic  i m afraid i cannot agree  unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto humans who ever walked   all in all  this was not a movie  it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience  i ve watched this three times  and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage  there is nothing profound here  whatsoever  it s crap   it rates a zero  from   the fiend
