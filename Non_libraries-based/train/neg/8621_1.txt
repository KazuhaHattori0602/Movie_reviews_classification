the previous poster obviously worked on the movie  it s a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did mentioning all of the actors  names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he s involved with it in some way   it s on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars  the one called ava is gorgeous and well endowed  were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason   also  when i first saw it  i was sure it was made in about   and i was born in   so i thought i knew what i was talking about but no it was made in   unbelievable   though i would call it one of those so bad it s good movies  like watching a train wreck
