i think i ve seen all of the grisham movies now and generally they re all very poor  except for the rainmaker  but this one is so bad it s unbelievable  warning spoilerish  it s one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do  he s a lawyer for christ s sake  why when his children go missing does he not call the police  oh yes it s because all the police hate lawyers so they re just ignore him and let him be attacked   when he s arrested for murder they just let him go free  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing    why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home   the police don t bother to try and find an escaped mental patient  they don t bother to interview his daughter   as for the ridiculous ending
   in summary  silly  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time       one of the worst films ever made
