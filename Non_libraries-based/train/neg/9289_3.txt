for those of you who were desperate to find out what happened to twitch in the original movie  heres your chance  and then get back to the real world   the guy who hid the gold in the first movie told twitch  so he gets transferred to another prison  where wrestling champs hang around looking broody  twitch plans to leave the jail in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman   then something happens and someone gets shot  and the film turns into die hard in another prison  but the wrestler s daughter is caught up in it all  so he and twitch go to find her and twitch s woman   as you can imagine  the acting is below par  it features a lot of  really annoying  rap music  and poorly edited fight scenes  on the plus side  it s got that hispanic bloke in it  who stars in every prison action thriller ever made  and he shuts a door in this   it s not very eventful  but at least it s harmless   if you were a massive fan of the original  it s okay ish stuff   if not  you have been warned
