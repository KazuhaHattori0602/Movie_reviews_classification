this movie is a muddled mish mash of clich s from recent cinema  there are some promising ideas in there  but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film  what he ended up with was a confusing mess  lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn t have much to work with  furthermore  the movie is largely devoid of scares  although  in fairness  there are some creepy moments amid the drudgery    mild spoilers   we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin  diabolical librarians  ghostly love interests  identity confusion  death by savage monkeys  oedipal conflict  abusive stepfathers  sublimated homosexuality  and crime gang connections  the only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent    perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother s death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover  the act itself is never directly portrayed  instead  director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys   not very scary    end spoilers   avoid this one  for an excellent psychological  ambiguous horror tale  check out the korean film a tale of two sisters
