i tried as hard as i could to sit all the way through this irritating mess  but i just couldn t do it  brad dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse    the whole thing is just ludicrous  from the awful acting to the laughable fx to the stupid plot   complete waste of time  don t bother  root canal therapy would be more enjoyable  bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant    watching a uwe boll movie would be only a little worse than this  get the idea
