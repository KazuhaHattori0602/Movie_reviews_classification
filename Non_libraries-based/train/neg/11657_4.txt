 scary movie   is a let down to the scary movie franchise  scary movie     and   were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny  luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies   this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night  things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape   this movie isn t horrible but they could have improved quite a few things  it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch   but i don t think you will like it nearly as much
