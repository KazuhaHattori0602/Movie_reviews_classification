crazed shotgun toting incest driven revenge seeking truck drivers   obsessive control disorder  daddy raped me when i was   handcuff carrying  all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable tv station  ie  skinemax  at  am on sunday nights   
and yes i know that was an entire sentence  but bare with me people  this is a long winded review for a short pointless film   filmed in  somewhere  canada  with almost no budget  the plot to this freak show is trite  the police in it obviously never heard of  state jurisdiction  because they end up chasing both miya  hookers  and trent  idiotic  anal retentive  generic  insecure college student  all across the u s   and i thought only the fbi could do that  the camera is shaky  the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like  ishtar  and  leonard part    as far as the skin scenes go  which is the only reason to even rent this movie  don t even think of buying it  there are two of them  the first one is the only one worth watching though which is the dominatrix sex scene with kari salin and ____ insert unknown actor here  he s obviously done nothing else worth noting  in a seedy  disgusting motel room  the kind with the busted sink that drips  and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it  it s all s m  riding crops  handcuffs  hot wax  and underwear licking  folks and in the end  he gets left in a motel room  with no money and cops waiting at his door  that s goes to show you guys  don t let a hooker tie you up in a  middle of nowhere  motel room  sadly though  kari shows no skin worth remembering  and that alone can cause deep seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen  so that is definitely a downer towards this flick   as for the ending   snicker snicker  i know you probably wouldn t mind if i revealed it to you but i won t  you should spend your hard earned money for that one  all in all i give it a   for action  a   for skin  see last paragraph  and a   for acting  character development or intricate plot twists     laughing man
