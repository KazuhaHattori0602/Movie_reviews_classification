   metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances  easily the film s best feature  yes  very easily  given that everything else is so bad  alsanjak admitted that   this low budget  violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters  and as a result  of hope  too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition  the film is not helped by poor subtitling    alsanjak s connecting contra todos to  dogme  and mike leigh didn t help matters   apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence   which  when they come  are just  banging everything in sight without rhyme  reason or skill    moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it  followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married  no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the  banality of evil  of low level hit men in working class neighborhoods  but he can t make the characters  which he sees generically  come alive for us  and the structure of the film shows that he also can t edit his material     seen at the san francisco international film festival on april
