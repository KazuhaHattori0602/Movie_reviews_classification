this movie is so bad that i cannot even begin to describe it  what in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers  producers and director  how on earth did they get funding for this abomination  the plot is laughable  the acting is poor at best  the story  what story  the first fight in this movie is ok but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off   i guess i m the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute     spoler alert    i only saw this movie because scott adkins was in it  and he is in it  for   seconds   i give it   out of   because it s the lowest grade imdb has to offer   do yourself a favour  see an uwe boll movie instead  twice  it s more worthy of your time
