jane russell proved to be a delightful musical comedy performer in the similarly titled  gentlemen prefer blondes 
 but  sadly  this film squanders those skills  there is a budget  and nice paris photography  but the film just doesn t work  ms  russell seems to be playing marilyn monroe  that leaves nobody to adequately play jane russell  some of the other players are way out of their element   there are several embarrassing scenes  most of all  be warned  there is a musical number where boneheaded african cannibals  cook  the brunettes in a pot  after alan young sings in a gorilla suit   this is an interesting  at times embarrassing  waste of resources      gentlemen marry brunettes   richard sale   jane russell  jeanne crain  alan young  scott brady
