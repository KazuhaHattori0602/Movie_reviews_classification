written and acted by sincere amateurs  produced by some exploitation monger  this is dull and hard to watch   not the worst movie ever  but at least schlock like _plan   from outer space_ usually had a real actor or two  i d recommend _a thief in the night_ only to hardcore ironists and hardcore dispensationalists  i m neither   don t believe me  watch it for free  albeit sourced from poor vhs  here      relevant links added mostly to reach imdb s  line minimum
