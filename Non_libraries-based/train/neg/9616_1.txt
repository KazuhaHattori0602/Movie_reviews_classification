first off  i had my doubts just looking at the dvd box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something  any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably  even as a slasher movie  except for the first friday the  th   i wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least   times  but i just kept thinking that it had to get a little better  it didn t  usually  i think every movie has something that you can take from it  this has nothing   do yourself a favor  and find something constructive to do for   minutes  like  give yourself papercuts  or eat dirt
