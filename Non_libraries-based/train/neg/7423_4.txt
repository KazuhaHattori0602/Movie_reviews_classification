there s really not a lot to say about las vegas lady  it s harmless enough  but it is little more than a dull heist film from the  s  the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be  the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that s been done to death  except in the case of las vegas lady  i think the robbery plot was designed by a   year old  the plan involves three women   one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building  one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity  and one to stand around exposing her cleavage  that s pretty much it  intricate  huh  other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts  the other women involved in the plot aren t particularly memorable  las vegas lady co stars stuart whitman  when not pawing stevens  his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film   i really wanted to like this movie  it does have that  s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa   but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a     and that s probably overstating it  in the end  las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage
