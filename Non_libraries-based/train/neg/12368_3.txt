 well chuck jones is dead  lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions  an american drawn anime knock off style  and give them superpowers   but sir  don t we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this  much less don t dump all over their original creators dreams   yes  and those shows make us a bunch of cash  and we need more   but won t every man women and child  who grew up with these time less characters  be annoyed   hay you re right  set it in the future  make them all descendent s of the original characters  and change all the names slightly but not too much though  we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics   well that s the only reason i can think of why this even exists  if you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved looney toons  then it looks like an ok show  but then there is already the teen titan s  which is the same bloody thing  all the characters are dressed like batman  they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains  they have superpowers  only difference is they sort of talk like the looney tunes and have similar names and character traits   this kind of thing falls into the  it s so ridiculous it s good  kind of category  think of the super mario brother s movie  and batman and robin  if you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons  check this out  if you are of the younger generation  what this thing is actually intended for  and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness  then run with it and enjoy   if you enjoy this cartoon i don t have a problem with you  it s the people who calculated this thing together that i am mad at  you know how they say piracy is like stealing a car  this show is like grave robbing  they might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon  shoved them on a display  dressed them up in
err pirate costumes  and charged money  if this show wasn t using characters  ones that didn t resemble the looney toons in anyway whatsoever  that have already made the studios millions  then this would be fine  but no  for shame warner brothers  for shame   if i saw this thing as a   second gag on an episode of the simpson s or family guy  i would love it  as it is i just can t believe this was ever made  i would bet anyone that   of the people who work on this show hate it  but whatever it doesn t really matter  in   years this show will have been forgotten  while the originals will live on forever
or at least until the world ends    coming   snoopy and the peanut gang are back  and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible  can charley brown defeat the evil alien warlord zapar  tune in and see
