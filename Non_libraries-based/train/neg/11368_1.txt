this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one  and i m jewish   anbody go to journalism school  read an editorial  freshman year rhetoric  these alarmist assertions  presented in a palatable way  might prove persuasive  but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments  nor viable  or any at all  solutions  few sources and each of dubious origin  makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe   and thank goodness for that   i wouldn t want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap   a good lesson for me   and hopefully a cautionary tale for you   to actually read about a film before seeing it
