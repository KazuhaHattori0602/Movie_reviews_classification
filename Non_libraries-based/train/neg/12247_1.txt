this film is really terrible  terrible as in it is a waste of   minutes of your life  special effects are so terrible  the acting wasn t convincing   its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about  blood surfing  blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a   foot crocodile interrupts there holiday  the sharks don t look real  the crocodile is even worse  and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature  but the crocodile gets stuck and   females flash it  the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time   a pointless  terrible film thats not worth seeing
