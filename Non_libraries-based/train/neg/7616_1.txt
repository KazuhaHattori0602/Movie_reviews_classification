the good news is a movie was made  drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec american  is such a word exists  cast  the bad news is  it was dead at birth   if ed wood had come out of retirement and coached george romaro through his classic  night of the living dead  this is what we might have come up with   the legend of diablo  is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of  mystery science theatre    i don t think one can even call this a  b  movie  the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard  mm film shot by a group of school kids    some spoilers  the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it  a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community  his daughters  one hot and one homely  team with a gringo fbi man and a priest  to try to re cage the demon    meanwhile  every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re enacted poorly  these zombies walk more like an army of nutty professors than the undead  the supposed infrared scenes from the demon s viewpoint are nothing special 
 and he she it sure seems to back up a lot  as opposed to turning around the moving forward  and the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast motion is ludicrous  it really  really appears to be done for comic effect although i know it wasn t  i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing   for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach   of course the darth vader field of dreams voice  calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical  then again  so was most of this cheese ball  robert napton  director and writer of the screenplay  should win something for this effort   how about a lifetime blackballing  like the  hollywood   this one  i now see  is rated   on a  scale  i fear this might be a tad generous    is there anything good about this movie  well  lindsey lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff  this is probably why her homely older sister  calvi pabon  really ran away from home  fred estrado is reasonably decent as the fbi agent  i wonder if mario soto  who played father rodriguez  is the same mario soto who pitched for the cincinnati reds  if so  he should have stuck to baseball  in fact  they couldn t have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it  demons in the outfield   if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class  i will issue apologies  it might be good enough for a b or even b  as long as the gang got the college s camcorder back to campus in one piece   the blair witch project  proved that a cool  campy movie could be made on a shoestring   the legend of diablo  though  didn t appear to have a shoestring or shoes to work from  it was low budget  low talent  low everything  the very final scene and i mean about the final   seconds of the film is the only mildly creative or interesting moment   i paid   to rent this  i could have better spent it on a hamburger
