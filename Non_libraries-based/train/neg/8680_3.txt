i just finished watching this film and wow was that bad  actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was so monumentally bad it was kind of entertaining  the action of the characters is hilarious  from the hyper dramatic way they fall to gunfire  to their incredibly bad acting  were the bad guys all just pulled off the street  or were they actually actors  to incredibly bad delivery of lines  to their inexplicable actions  if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter  obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob  this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines   the camera work was also really bad   you can hardly see what s going on in the fight scenes due to switching camera angles and shakiness   i would have voted   except that i do like chiba and sidekick sue shihomi  and i was entertained by a couple of scenes    breaking of a villain s arm so the bone pops out of the skin  that s gotta hurt    a drug kingpin eating a brown furred animal  a monkey  by hacking away at the carcass with a meat cleaver   sonny chiba s performing some impromptu eye surgery on a guy with his fingers   i am actually a big fan of sonny chiba but this one is really not worth anyone s time  i ve seen about   or   of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth watching  and they are great  are the street fighter series  and the killing machine  i ve also heard the executioner and golgo   are good  i recommend sticking to those ones
