it is quite simple  friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults  with unsophisticated sense of humour   it is also painfully obvious that towards the end  they were desperately trying to make it last   seasons  most likely so they could say they beat seinfeld s   season run  the trouble with this is  seinfeld had   amazing seasons with great writing  friends had  and i m being very generous here  at most   or   ok seasons and then   abysmal seasons   it became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren t that good so start with  then got worse at the  th time you saw them  i find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly  it is truly awful
