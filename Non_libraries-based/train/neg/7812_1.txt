in a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as snakes on a plane and the da vinci code  that s a pretty bold statement  but i stand by it nonetheless  superman returns  like king kong   months before it  is overlong  hyper indulgent and with cgi up to the eyeballs  my god  this stuff is doing my head in   richard donner had the idea of  keep it real  for his   outings  and i do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate  brian singer bombards us with so much cgi that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend   million  a totally irresponsible amount of money  on obnoxious visual effects that don t live up to the hype  we ve seen everything and been everywhere that cgi can take us  there s no real atmosphere or involvement in this  and for a film that is   made up of this crap well you figure it out   i ve read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has  soul  or  a human heart  or  tender character moments  puh lease  we ve already had brooding superheros silently screaming  you d love me if you knew who i am  dozens of times already in recent years and sr offers absolutely nothing new in this regard  even the plot is recycled garbage  lex luthor  a seriously mis cast and hammy kevin spacey  plotting to destroy the landmass of america was done in the first film already  and  well that s your lot  it s amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to   painful hours  even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable  but brandon routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat stand  kate bosworth is completely unconvincing as a pulitzer prize winning journalist  james marsden is   wooden  as usual and kevin spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement  the only cast member i liked was the lovely parker posey  but i m into weird looking girls   every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic  pretty soon we ll have   million films  studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up  for all the money that warner spent on this pile of crap  for all the resources that this movie cost to make was it worth it  in my opinion  certainly not  this garbage has put me of superman for life
