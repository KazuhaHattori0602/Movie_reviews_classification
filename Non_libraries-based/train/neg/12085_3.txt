there s really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis  i mean it s shakespeare s hamlet for goodness sake   probably one of the best known plays ever written  i m not embarrassed to admit that i came to this version of hamlet the way most people on imdb have   through mystery science theater   while the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie  in this case i cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips  in a word  this german  made for tv version of hamlet is dreary    minutes  no way  it s too dark and depressing to be anything i want to spend almost three hours on  i ve said it any number of times  but entertainment is the thing for me  and this wrist slitter is far from entertaining  i will  however  give it a couple of points for what i felt was some reasonably good acting  a   sounds about right to me   as much as i enjoy mst k  their comments don t help to make hamlet any more palatable  there are a few good riffs here and there  but overall  hamlet is just the wrong movie for mst k  shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow  as much as it pains me  i ve got to give hamlet a   on my mst k rating scale
