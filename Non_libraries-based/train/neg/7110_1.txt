well  one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was  gutsy would be the right term  not only did he use a total cast of five people  no extras at all  but he also decided to use sub par special effects with a confusing and boring plot  he also  and i am not kidding  put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright  however  they do promise a freeeeee coooofffffffiiiiinnnnn  to have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move  yaaa unique aaa wnnn   if you watch mystery science theater   you might ve seen this  they like to showcase horrible movies  just to let you know   a good gift for someone you hate
