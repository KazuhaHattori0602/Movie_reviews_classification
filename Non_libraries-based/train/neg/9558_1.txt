i thought this was a sequel of some sorts  and it is meant to be to the original from   but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it   i actually had very little expectations to this movie  but i just wasted   minutes of life  no suspense   i actually feel clairvoyant  poor acting  and so filled with technical errors  so i as a computer geek just couldn t believe it  they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and   hours  but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie   do not see this movie  this is a complete waste of time  instead get the original  the theme is still valid  don t let to much power into a machine  and the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling
