 warning  possible spoilers below  the film is more boring then anything else  there seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns  but none of it works   mst k did a fairly good job with it  but on its own the movie is mostly tedious   funny moments   when the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes  the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband  who is trying to drive the wife crazy  says in a deadpan voice  there is no skull there  there s no skull   when the real ghost skulls have the husband caught in a pickle  as if trapped between first and second base
