this movie isn t terrible  really  somebody commented that mo is the type of american europeans snicker at  but there are those  and not necessarily anglo saxon yahoos  who do not care for frenchmen  and the xavier character isn t going to sway them   let s consider his stereotypical frenchman attributes     cynical   very cynical  check     reedy  underfed appearance  check  despite     a great appreciation of cuisine  check     lukewarm work ethic  check   forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker  from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks      beautiful wife  check  despite that     loose interpretation of the marriage vows  check     big sexual ego  which says an american girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner  check   whether mo is a hick or not  there s no reason for her to fall for this smug european twit other than the script dictates so   on the other hand  as other male reviewers have  i did enjoy seeing karen allen s cute  petite body  i ll give the movie four stars  two of them are for that
