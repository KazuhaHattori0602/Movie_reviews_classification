the deceptive cover  title and very small hidden print of power of prayer tricked me into renting this movie   it started out really well and pulled me in  i really liked it  between   and  s of it  the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense  my first thought was   this is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story  i ended up re watching parts of the movie  thinking i had missed something   by the time i reached the last   of the movie  it was all boring  annoying  religion thumping dialog that made no sense  said nothing  and was annoying to listen to  i turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end   don t waste your time with this flick   beware of dvds labeled whitlow films and level path productions   and i m a practicing catholic
