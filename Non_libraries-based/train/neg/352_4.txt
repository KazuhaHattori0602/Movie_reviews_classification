seems that the cast should ensure at least an average movie  and so i sat down for   minutes of unbelief  beside ed harris no one seems to own the skills of acting  even sean connery  who i normally worship  must have had an off day during the entire filming of just case  not once in during the whole movie one actor could convince me   this made this movie look cheap and unreal   the story makes up a little  it is thrilling  and the plot is unexpected   conclusion only watch this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do
