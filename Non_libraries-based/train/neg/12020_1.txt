this was such a waste of time  danger  if you watch it you will be tempted to tear your dvd out of the wall and heave it thru the window   an amateur production  terrible  repetitive  vacuous dialog  paper thin plot line  wooden performances  lucy lawless was pathetically hackneyed   seriously flawed story  completely unbelievable characters  the two worst concepts in film and t v  are    the evil twin    amnesia  there are no twins   the plot  twist  outrageously simplistic and obvious   like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies  it doesn t even resolve properly  the evil is not punished for the original crime   please  please  please   don t watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue
