in short  the movie had a little bit of a weak  st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing  somewhat of a decent  nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast  and the  rd act   there virtually wasn t any  rd act   regarding the  rd act  the movie just abruptly ends  there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the  nd act  so there wasn t much of a  rd act  the bad guys die and that s that  the end credits roll  there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on  the audience would ve likely left the theater after the movie  asking  that s it  a real letdown   music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time  but it s certainly nothing outstanding  it s just functional  but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative  it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion  what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from   hrs  and  commando  particularly the brass   in all  the film had potential as the basic story itself is good  but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction  weak acting  and somewhat inconsistent pacing   there was virtually no  rd act to properly finish the story  and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn t allow the movie to end satisfactorily  this could either be the screenplay or  possibly  the production had to cut out filming or editing the  rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints  but i m speculating as to why there isn t a  rd act  whatever the reason  the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall    this is good for a view if you re curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the   acts  beginning  middle  end  if you write screenplays and make movies   otherwise  you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst k version to at least get some laughs out of it
