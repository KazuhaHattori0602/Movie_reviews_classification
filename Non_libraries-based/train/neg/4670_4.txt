this adaptation  like  s  the heiress  is based on the henry james novel   the heiress  starring olivia de havilland  remains as a well respected piece of work  though less true to james  original story than this new remake  which retains james  original title  it is the story of a awkward  yet loving daughter  leigh  devoted to her father  finney  after her mother dies during childbirth  the arrogant father holds his daughter in no esteem whatsoever  and considers her  as well as all women  simpleminded  when a young man  chaplin  of good family and little fortune comes courting  the father is naturally suspicious  but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man  is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and forbids her to see him  leigh is a controversial actress   most either love her or hate her   and she always has a particular edginess and tenseness to her style  like she s acting through gritted teeth  she s not bad in this  and she handles her role relatively deftly   it s just an awkward role for any actress  making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses  while the character garners a lot of sympathy  she s not particularly likable  the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin  previously seen in  the truth about cats and dogs  plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune  or is really in love with her  maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt  finney is marvelous  of course  as the father who threatens to disinherit his daughter for her disobedience  but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves  but does her ardent suitor still want her without her fortune  this is only one instance where  washington square  differs from  the heiress  another instance is the ability to stick with it  it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping faucet  offering too little story in too long of a movie
