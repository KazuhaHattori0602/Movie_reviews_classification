the dukes of hazzard is quite an achievement   a  m film that s worse than any given episode of a downmarket  year old tv show  the plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious  johnny knoxville is more passenger than protagonist  m c  gainey s sheriff roscoe is a bland thug  michael weston s enos tiresome  a seemingly ideally cast willie nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and burt reynolds  stuck in some purgatory where he s doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player  is a curious choice for boss hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill  you know a film is in trouble when seann william scott and jessica simpson are the most charismatic screen presences
 but worse than the script or the casting is jay chandrasekhar s hopeless direction  seemingly born with no conception of comic timing  unable to do much more than basic two shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film  he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise  there are a couple of neat post modern moments revolving around the confederate flag and daisy s stereotypical role in every episode  but no film that makes you pine for the days when hal needham was directing this sort of thing  and badly  can be a good thing
