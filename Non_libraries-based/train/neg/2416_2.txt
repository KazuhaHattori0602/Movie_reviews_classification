  stars  and i m being generous   minor spoilers  look  this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland  as the plot goes  a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive by   the main problem with this movie  what zombies  all the  zombies  do is growl  which doesn t sound even remotely scary  and drip fake red blood from their mouths  no scary eyes  no decaying flesh  just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots   the cover is also misleading  there are only about   zombies in the whole film  so it s not like the whole  hood  is plagued with zombies or anything  it s just a few  and is contained in no time   the acting actually is so bad it s hilarious  no one can act at all in this movie  except maybe one of the gang members  and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together  decided to cast their family  and made a movie one weekend   final note  since when do doctors wear tracksuits  skip this one  please
