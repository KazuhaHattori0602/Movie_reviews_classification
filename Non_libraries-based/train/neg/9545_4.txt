will farmer  lanter  plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack  and ripley  the super government computer  designed to profile potential terrorists  tracks him because will borrowed  by hacking  some money from his next door neighbor s bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in philadelphia  the next door neighbor whose computer will was fixing  has relatives in the mid east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor s bank   and ripley sees a terrorist connection  ripley has the power to call up missile strikes  oh  oh   this version of war games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the war games movie in the early  s  well  the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days  makes sense  so the movie dazzles us with fantastic cgi on computer screens  and once joshua  the forerunner to ripley  is found operational  we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing  hoping  praying
 sort of  oh oh ing  omg ing  and more cringing hoping things will go their way  in other words we are now experiencing a made for tv type movie  and it s oh hum time  go back to the  s and watch the original war games movie  it s much better    but  we really have to ask ourselves  are we making computers too intelligent where one day  in time  they will rule us  hmmm
