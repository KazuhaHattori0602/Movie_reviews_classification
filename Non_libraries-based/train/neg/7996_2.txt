is there a book titled  how to make a movie with every  man vs  nature  clich  imaginable  if not  ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects  ants doesn t have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its   minute runtime  i suppose the most surprising thing about ants is that they actually stretched the film to   minutes  the set up  the characters  the various sub plots  the death scenes  and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times   and in most cases  much better  it s amazing that so many of these insects on a rampage films were made in the  s because they re all basically the same movie   and can someone please tell me what in god s name myrna loy is doing in this monkey turd of a movie  a woman as talented and classy as loy deserved better than ants as one of her final movies
