scary movie   is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words  it makes movies like malibu s most wanted look like oscar material  lets just say that   the original scary movie was great fun  one of the better  s spoof movies  coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with dont be a menace to south central whilst drinking your juice in the hood  but what the hell happened  after the tragedy that was scary movie   i thought the cast and crew change would help matters  but its even worse   within  mins i d smiled twice  not one laugh  the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor  the fact that at this point in writing  the majority of people on this site have voted it   has made me feel physically ill  when there s great flicks like school of rock out  which actually have jokes that are  gasp  funny  anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined   no stars
