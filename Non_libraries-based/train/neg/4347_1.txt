wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late  s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison  he got out in   and said he was in for   years  they used a bunch of nobody actors  and a story that didn t even make sense  they bring back only one actor  guzman  and hes playing a totally different guy  why did it end with him and this puerto rican chick  wheres gale  he said he was in love with her before  wheres kleinfeld  he said he knew him forever you d think he d have been in this one  and if this made sense  where are rocco and the black dude in the first one  it was all just stupid this is an insult to pacino and the first film
