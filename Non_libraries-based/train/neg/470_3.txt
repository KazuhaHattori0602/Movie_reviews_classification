i used to love this movie as a kid but  seeing it again   years later  it actually sucks  up the academy might have been ahead of it s time back in   but it has almost nothing to offer today  movies like caddyshack and stripes hold up much better today than this steaming dogpile  no t a  no great jokes except for the one liners we ve all heard a million times by now   i recently bought the dvd in hopes that it would be the gem i remembered it being  well  i was way off  the soundtrack had only   widely recognizable hits  not the smash compilation others had mentioned  and the frequent voice overs were terrible  the only thing that was interesting  to me  was predicting what the character s lines were before they said them  yep  i watched this movie that much back then    the only reason i am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten  sorry to say
