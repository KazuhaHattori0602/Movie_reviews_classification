as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre  especially those which are the products of my native cinema  and i can say that that the  power of fear   or  vedma  as the russian title of it  is one of the weakest film among them  firstly  it can t scary even a little kid  it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror  frankly speaking  it s bad in all points  from the goofy plot  i don t know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller  i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer   it doesn t thrill a bit  and to the terrible and cheesy actors  work  all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn t even bother to play at all  only spoke their english lines without any expression  and at the end i don t really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors  i think it was their wrong turn  at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing  the same i can say about so called  small american town backgrounds  which were shot in estonia and look like it  the only positive moment i found in the  power of fear  is the visual effects  they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film  and the music is ok  at least it doesn t irritate me  that s why i give it two stars  overall  if you want to see good horror film   don t waste your time and money on this boring flick  and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror i d advise you to find a copy of  viy or the spirit of evil  it s really the terrific movie based on the same novel as  power of fear  but much  much better
