i am going to keep this short this  adaption  of the wonderful king book is a bad joke and nothing more of course there are many kubrick and nickolson fans in this site and as a result this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top   jack nicholson is laughable as torrance and so is shelley duvall the story that has nothing to do with the book is an incoherent mess and the characters of jack and wendy torrance are complete jokes   my advice to anyone that hasn t read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story stick to the tv series    oh  and the people who are saying that kubrick had every right to destroy the king story cause king is not a good writer should stick to reviewing  masterpieces  like  eyes wide shut
