let me start out by saying this movie has   funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and george  narrator huh  wait a minute  who the heck are you  george  me new george  studio too cheap to pay brendan fraser  narrator  how did you get the part  george  new george just lucky  i guess    sadly  that s the only funny part in the entire movie   it was still entertaining but then again  i m easily entertained   i wouldn t say this is the worst movie i ve ever seen  that title goes to the terribly un funny disaster movie  this movie falls   on my bottom   list   if your a small child who is easily entertained  you ll enjoy this movie  if you re a movie watcher who wants a good  funny movie  you ll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one
