or  it s a bird   it s a plane   no  look  it s a disaster   or  no need to look up in the sky   or    ok  that s enough  if singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record  he failed  the sr structure can t do this  the dark and restricted color scheme  i would call it  wishi washi  the boring usual dialogs  the clown with advanced alien technology  the missing fun and magic  etc  makes the movie completely disappointing   it simply doesn t work   the main thing at a character like superman is  that he is a superhero  that s the core  the most important thing   love trouble and a sadly lost depressive supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a   long superman movie  not the whole time   because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore  it s like a  and in this case a very bad and boring  social study  where every   minutes a person flies around   that s a big difference   this movie is a joke  holy skywalker  this is superman  so give us supervillains  superaction and the most important thing  superfun   we want entertainment   singer  if you want to make a   long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people   then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake   they say  superman returns  and then  supersadlysoftie stands in the door   maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite  but one bad movie can t do this  don t give up  they plan a sequel   next time singer  and warner brothers  make a superhero movie  not a depressive superlame soap  or let it be  a superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic   this movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover  yes  technically there are all sorts in  yes  there is a lot of small talks  there are a few jokes  a view action scenes  etc  but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality   it s not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my live   the ridiculous cast strategy  cast them young as possible  so we can make sequels in the next   years  gives the rest  kate bosworth plays a   year old star reporter  she s looking like   superman was full five years away  so he slept with her   years ago  so she was    looking like   and a daily planet reporter  wroting  i spend a night with superman  warner brothers  that s too much   routh is not so bad  he is playing a little bit wooden  but the whole movie is wooden  so    temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey  the rest  forget it  even spacey  this is not his terrain   reeve hackman kidder were acting so easy  with fun  what a difference   the jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too  what the hell should that be   the problem here is  they mean this serious  not as a joke  next time spiderman or batman or ironman falls and rises like jesus or angels   or they speak with god directly  why not   they are superheroes  saving human lives every day  so at least one talk with god every week should be possible  oh my god   maybe this was not the real announced movie  instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe   for the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history  not only because of the money   i understand how difficult it  maybe  was to create and transport some messages or feelings  but showing lone  lost and sadly people isn t new and thousands of movies or tv shows did it better  in very old or new ones like magnolia  and the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman  sorry  superman of course   singer and wb  that s simply nothing  in fact it s even more than nothing  it s like a black hole that destroys the passion for  comic superhero  movies and steals us three hours of our life   mrs  smilla s little brother   very angry and green like the hulk
