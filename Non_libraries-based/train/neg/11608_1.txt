if this guy can make a movie  then i sure as hell can make one too   in fact  if you hire me to make a movie for you  i promise to do the following     i will add more naked women  this movie had none  i think cheesy b class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body  i wouldn t want to let my viewers down     i will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it s only a dream  i think horrorvision had about   of these scenes  and  considering the movie was only like an hour long  the dream to movie length ratio was quite high  and  if i do decide to do a dream sequence  i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on  i mean  who sleeps in leather pants     i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine      and finally  i will not mix modern technology with the undead  i mean  a palm pilot can only be so scary   at least they turned it into an evil rolly polly monster before the screen blew up or something   so  if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production  count on me  wanna b movie director extraordinaire
