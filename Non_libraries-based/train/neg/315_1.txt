watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of sandler  truly a slow and painful death    bought the dvd in the   bin at wal mart  but the thought that keeps echoing in my head is   how can i get my money back   the most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat just does not sink   best constructive suggestion  mystery comedy theatre  you know that show on the scifi channel in which some guy and his muppet machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks  mystery science theatre  immediately  spin off a comedy program and feature this flick  without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck  i fear that viewers may actually begin following sandler with ice picks and chainsaws
