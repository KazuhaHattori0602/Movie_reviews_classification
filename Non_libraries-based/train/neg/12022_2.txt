the story idea is excellent  unfortunately  the execution lets it down   the movie lacks pace  for one thing  it should be an exciting ride  but it is slow and more than a little boring   i think the problem s mainly in the screenplay and editing  there aren t enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense  and there are scenes which don t really move the story along very effectively   the producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite  unfortunately  when the producer is also the writer and the director  this evidently ain t gonna happen   much of the acting seems kind of flat  and that is down to the director   all the actors have been quite competent in other projects   it s a shame  because with better writing  editing and direction  this could have been a really good thriller
