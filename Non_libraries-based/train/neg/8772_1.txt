there s nothing new for me to say    hours of people dying over and over in the same hill  the cast was stellar  but unfortunately the producer director editor god goofed  he should have eaten humble pie  if not for his own sake then for the men who died in kargil  hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors  hired a real scriptwriter  hired a real editor  hired a musician that wasn t related to him in some way  and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of  apocalypse now  on some cheap indian drug  hired a real professional crew  thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story  unfortunately he  like the bigwigs of the indian army  made decisions that were terrible for his actors  and terrible for his audience  we all died over and over    please don t do that again  sir  sushma kathmandu  nepal  ps  next time an indian director decides to glorify the gurkha regiment  i suggest he hire more than one nepali to represent the team  surely there are plenty of nepali men working in bombay last count was   to half a million
