my favorite part was when the credits started to roll  i wish i could give it a   out of   i really wish i had that hour and thirty minutes back  don t waste your money or time on it  i really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards   nadia was really pretty and i hope the movie didn t destroy her career  but she chose to be in it   all in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked  more than kazaam and glitter combined  that s saying something   don t  do  it
