 aka  demons iii   made for italian tv although shot in english and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier demons films  it was supposed to be simply titled  the ogre  which is how director lamberto bava had released it   an american family rents an italian villa for the summer  the woman  virginia bryant  has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon like structure hanging down from the ceiling  it glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it  it drips what looks like green paint   of course the husband doesn t believe any of this  the villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it   but then the ogre itself appears in what looks like some kind of  th centaury costume with what looks like a wolf s head attached to it and it s attracted to the scent of orchids   the films isn t really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring  there s no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool  the ogre itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family s jeep cherokee    the copy of the shriek dvd i watched was defective  with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film  a flaw i hope shriek has since corrected  extras include a short interview with lamberto bava where he explains how this wasn t a sequel  etc etc along with some trailers to other shriek dvd releases  this is pretty standard stuff     out of
