this contains spoilers   i have rarely seen a film that is as unbelievable as this one is  and being french  it tries for depth by being enigmatic
 nothing really makes any sense   l o is gay and has just announced at breakfast to his family that he is hiv positive  the youngest brother  marcel  has not yet come down to breakfast  and the first thing the family does is decide that at   years of age he is too young to be told  maybe if he was four or five  but twelve  the first totally unbelievable thing is that the family doesn t even ask where or how he got the virus  how long he has known about it
 nothing is asked  they only worry about marcel finding out  this is a very close  knit provincial family  but although they decide not to let marcel know about l o s hiv positive status nor the fact of his being gay  the rest of the family accepts all this news with absolutely no questions or reactions  how many families do you know where the parents brothers wouldn t have at least some reaction to one of the members announcing that he is gay  here  nothing   l o decides that he needs to go to paris to see his ex lover  and he decides to go on the trip with  of all people  marcel  do you know anyone who would bring his little brother along to go see a lover  again  totally unbelievable  especially since marcel is not supposed to know either of his medical problems nor of his homosexuality  if this is the way the family has decided to let him find out  it is rather brutal and again unbelievable   l o goes to find his lover  aymeric  at his work in a paris bar  the owner says that aymeric will not be there until the early evening  but why would l o want to see him at work  why not phone and arrange to see him in some place more private where they can really talk  why not go and see him at his home  but no  l o shows up later in the day  with marcel in tow  and is surprised when aymeric doesn t just drop everything to go walk with him for   minutes  aymeric tells him that he is no longer available  that it was l o who left him  and that l o hadn t replied to any of his letters  l o says  but i love you  and then wanders off  but if he really loved aymeric  wouldn t he have at least told him about his hiv status  to warn him to get tested and maybe get medication  this would be the least he could do   but not a peep  he leaves and doesn t even warn aymeric that he might have contracted the aids virus  this is totally irresponsible of him   and of the film makers  this film was apparently made for a french tv series for young people   it is the perfect way to show kids how to be responsible  well  not here
 i guess  every man for himself  is still the french way of doing things
 another aspect of the film which was totally unbelievable was the  touchy feely  aspect  everyone is always leaning against someone  caressing someone or kissing someone  inside the family and outside the family  i have never seen anyone in france be this physical  never mind an entire family  seated at the breakfast table  one   year old brother has his leg perched on the lap of his elder brother  and the elder brother is caressing his leg as everyone sits around discussing something  how many brothers do you know who are that physically close  in another scene  the same   year old comes into marcel s room asking  what s the matter  can t you sleep  then takes off his clothes and  completely naked  gets into bed with his brother and snuggles up to him as if they were lovers  this and another similar scene between l o and marcel gave a somewhat incestuous feel to the film  sorry  again i don t believe that this is regular behaviour between teenage brothers   the only good thing i can say about the film is that the actors are all quite fine
 especially marcel in the main role  but it wasn t really enough
 hiv and aids are far too serious to be presented in such a vague and irresponsible light  at the end of the film  the family has gone to the cemetery to bury l o  but once again  marcel has been left out of it   he has been left in the care of a cousin  i think  nevertheless he sneaks out and watches the funeral from afar  is this what such a close knit family would have done  it is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brother s funeral  it was the last scene of the film  and it was the last straw for this viewer
