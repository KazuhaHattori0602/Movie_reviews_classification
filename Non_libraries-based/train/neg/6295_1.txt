suffice to say that   despite the odd ludicrous panegyric to his soi disant  abilities  posted here   the director of this inept  odious tosh hasn t made a film since  well that is excellent news as far as i m concerned   dead babies has all of the bile of its creator  but lacks the wit and technical proficiency that make martin amis the novelist readable   when will the british film industry wake up and realise that if it wants to regain the status it once had it should stop producing rubbish like this and make something real people will actually want to watch   avoid like the plague
