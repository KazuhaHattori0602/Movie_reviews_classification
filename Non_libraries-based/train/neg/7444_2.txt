unless you are petrified of russian people or boars  this movie is a snorefest  actually  i fell asleep about   minutes in   had to fight the urge to just leave the theater  i wish i had  a waste of a perfectly lovely saturday evening   even  silent hill  was scarier  heck  even  pan s labyrinth  was scarier  i m still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick   to begin with  i m very leery of movies that use  pidgin russian  like this one did in the opening credits  it s embarrassing to me since i brought a group of my russian friends   we all cringed  oh my god   hmm  well  luckily for me   probably you  too  this movie has already escaped my brain   i just stepped out of it an hour ago  so i have no specifics  just murky visuals that go nowhere   some languishing now dead hope that anything would happen   perhaps i saw a completely mutilated version of this film because i can t believe it got such great reviews here  which is why i saw it    ended up being so completely devoid of not only horror or suspense but overall entertainment value as well   i give it a   because  yes  i fell asleep   wanted to leave after   minutes but i woke up   didn t leave
