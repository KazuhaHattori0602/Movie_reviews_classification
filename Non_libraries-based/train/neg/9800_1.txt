mighty morphin power rangers came out in   supposedly based on the japanese sentai television show that started back in the  s  now as a fan of japanese action films and series  you would think i would get a kick out of this show   you could not be more wrong  what worked in the japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers   mmpr is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot   now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either transformers movie  yet  the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked   it was followed by two really bad  and i do mean  really bad movie knock offs  and the actors starring in this series  completely disappeared from the scene   if you must choose  try watching japan s zyuranger series instead   also  what s up with the awful long  s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys  it makes them all look feminine
