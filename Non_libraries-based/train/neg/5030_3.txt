what s that there in the skies  is it a plane  is it superman  errr  no
 it s a turtle  see  that s what becomes of the cold war  nothing but bad news and other issues  the americans shoot down a russian combat plane somewhere over artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts   literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle creature named gammera  he she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path  the arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super sophisticated ice bomb  but gammera has another surprise in store
 the damn turtle can fly  the first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence  gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air  how can you not love that  then there s also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who s able to telepathically communicate with the monster  but that s just not interesting enough  flying turtle  people  there s very little else to write about this japanese  and american re edited  sci fi effort  apart from that it s an obvious and totally shameless rip off of such classics like the original godzilla and the beast from   fathoms  the effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and  unlike the aforementioned films  it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance  respectable actors like brian donlevy  the quatermass experiment  and dick o neill  wolfen  seem unaware of what film set they re on and even the original japanese mayhem scenes aren t very convincing  gammera s very own and personalized theme song is rather cool  though  so it gets one extra point for that
