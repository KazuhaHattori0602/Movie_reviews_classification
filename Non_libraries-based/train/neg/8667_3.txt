this sports a nice  deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk  the first third of this movie was nothing but talk  and more talk  most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other    the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it s really a  chick flick  and little else  this probably plays on the lifetime network   there was a quick murder scene and then more talk  by halfway through  they had lost me    by the way  sally field looked about   years old in here
