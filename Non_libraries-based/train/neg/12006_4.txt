ok the director remakes love actually the director nikhil advani after debuting with khnh does his second half and wait  he makes a   hours   film which loses on patience  time etc the viewer seems like a   hrs sleep watching this film  ok they had   stories so it was necessary but why    stories   we have the anil  juhi story convincing but boring don t tv serials show such stories   we have govinda  shannon story which is funny and works well   we have akshaye ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy  we have salman  priyanka story which is the worst  not just acting terms  it makes no sense at all  we have sohail  isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories  we have john  vidya story a good story in all respects  but then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy the climax isn t appealing though especially the climax of salman  priyanka story nikhil advani s handling is alright at places  some stories are well handled but weak at places music sel is good  but too many songs cinematography is nice  every story is given a different look  texture and it works  actors govinda rocks  after a dismissal comeback with bb he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight anil kapoor acts his part well  though he looks out of shape and tired john excels in his part  akshaye khanna overacts for a change  sohail khan is too over  the   top and isha has nothing to do anjana suknani is dismissal  priyanka and salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked   salman khan doesn t act only  just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her  she does get better towards the end vidya balan is good  juhi chawla is okay shannon is okay
