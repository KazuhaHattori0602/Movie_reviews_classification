this is a terrible remake of a marginal  but well liked  movie from the early  s  i have seen the original at least   times  the   version is a   minute movie  crammed  into   hours or whatever the runtime is  cheesy storyline  which by the way  is completely different than the original  the major government involvement was far fetched  there is no flow from one scene to the next  in the original you could go get a beer or hit the bathroom and still keep up    it only took a few hours movie time to change the oil pan on the car  it takes many times longer than that in real life  car guys notice this stuff  also  the fool or fools that chose to trash a   charger and abuse a   challenger should be shot in the heel with a dull bullet  the fact they aren t  car people  is painfully obvious  and their passing will not be grieved    the actors lacked any emotion  everything was cut and dried  one step above a monotone  a barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic   last but surely not least  the radio dj made the statement that the challenger hit the bulldozers at   or     that is total garbage  can you say aerodynamics  or lack thereof  hahahaha  this movie is a joke  don t waste your time watching this one
