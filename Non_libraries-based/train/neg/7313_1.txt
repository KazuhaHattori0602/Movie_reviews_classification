i wasted   to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things   what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie  the disease had nothing to do with being split in half   what was the point of dragging karen into the shed  she already totally infected her room  they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer   why would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative  the hog lady  to take him to the hospital   why didn t any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad  are they all really that lazy   even if paul was threatened by the guy w  the shotgun for peeping on his wife  paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help  the girl he loves is deteriorating   what was the point of the box   why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected  if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn t he have just gone back home   if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit  why did they throw paul halfway into the river  it wasn t even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated   who makes lemonade out of river water  that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it  why couldn t the two kids have just use the tap water  it was contaminated too  so the stupid ending would still work
