okay  i was bored and decided to see this movie  but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage  then basically that same hour repeated   times  it consists of   gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan    flashbacks to the men s wives   the approach of the troops marching in a long line   men running up hill and shooting  usually the first getting shot in the head then   other men rescuing him    defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success   men flashing back to wives and singing   minute songs  that was the basic movie  and that same order of events happened about   or   times  and every time it did a flashback to the wives  it would show the man  then his wife and him  there were about   men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time  other than that  the men couldn t kill their enemy except with either bayonets or grenades  i liked the music and there was a lot of action  though the action was repetitive  overall  i probably wouldn t see it again  but it wasn t too horrible
