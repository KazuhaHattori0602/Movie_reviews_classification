this movie couldn t decide what it wanted to be  there were a couple of sub plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end  but they didn t  if you want a  alien in the frozen waste  story  stick with the  s version of the thing  not the abomination that was remade in gore o vision   years later   i couldn t get over the fact that the  alien  looked pretty much recycled from independence day    the  bare minimum  sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood   lots of scenery chewing with little payoff
