geez  this is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn t  i mean  you didn t give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind   to be honest and brief  this is one of the worst  boring  and stupid slashers ever made  i can t say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it s made by professional film makers   the death scenes are horrible  bloodless  stupid  the plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied  popcorn  from    to make things even worse  this isn t a movie so bad that it s good  it s just plain bad   molly ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn t enough
