average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance   the genre s well known weaknesses are in full gear  banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points  and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say  limp affair   fulci s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though  yellow clues wherever you look     out of   limping killers
