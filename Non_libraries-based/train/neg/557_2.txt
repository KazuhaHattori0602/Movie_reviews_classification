it s hard to believe  after waiting   years  we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage  the original was a high impact  dark thriller that achieved  cult  status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven  this film adds nothing  delivers nothing  and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels   the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast  unfortunately we are treated to a   minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell  or is it sharon stone  possibly a copulation of both   if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in  b s  forget it  you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them  it s interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies  via the   georgy girl  when ms  stone was only   years old  a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here   if you re a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system  if not  you might as well wait for the dvd release in the  rated  version   unrated  version   collectors  edition  or  ultimate  version  and perhaps in another   years we will be saturated with news of  basic instinct   at which point ms  stone will be   years old and nobody will really care
