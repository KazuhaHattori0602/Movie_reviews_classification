first  the cgi in this movie was horrible  i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel  at the end when the owner of the park gets killed  it s probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen  even night of the living dead had better animation   that said  the movie had almost no plot  why were they on that island in particular  well  it wasn t stated in the movie  and  why would the people keep coming into the cat s area  makes no sense   one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting  in what could be called a  b made for tv movie  movie  the acting was very good  parry shen stood out in particular   if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday  watch this movie  it may be good for some memorable quotes
