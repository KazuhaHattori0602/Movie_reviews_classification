depending entirely on your own personal state of mind when watching this   christmas evil  can either turn out to become an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller or one of the most pathetic and infuriatingly lame holiday themed slashers ever made  me  personally  i m tempted to opt for the latter because i didn t bother to do any research at all and simply anticipated a cheesy and undemanding early  s slasher with a nutcase in a santa clause costume butchering people  wrong  the movie actually handles about a bloke named harry stadling  who s obsessed with christmas  works in a rubbish toy factory and considers it to be his responsibility to determine on christmas eve who deserves presents and who deserves punishment  harry s issues all started when he witnessed santa   his daddy in a costume obviously   caress his mommy s naked legs at a tenderly young age  after that he just developed into a social outcast  much to the irritation of his younger brother  who s bound to snap one  holi day  i fully understand why certain fans appreciate this slightly eccentric horror movie  but did it really have to be so boring  there are several overlong and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens  i can forgive the shortness of gore and outrageous bloodshed  but this movie doesn t even benefice from an unsettling atmosphere or unexpectedly demented plot twists  with the notable exception of the finale  i must admit  also  i would have taken the concept more seriously if the crazed protagonist would focus himself on lethally punishing the naughty children  he doesn t and exclusively kills misbehaving adults  how are you supposed to take wannabe controversial and original christmas thriller serious when santa doesn t even commit one miserable child murder  that would have made  christmas evil  a classic  whereas now it s just a forgettable and pitiable piece of junk
