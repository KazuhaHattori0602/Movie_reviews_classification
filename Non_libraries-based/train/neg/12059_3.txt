the  s were not very kind to one time major star charles bronson  starting with  s  death wish ii  and ending with this truly gruesome film from   bronson s screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness   d w  ii  left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson s character s daughter   a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail    to midnight  was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards  nothing redeeming about it  other films like  the evil that men do  and the remaining  death wish  films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge  i m not sure if the producers  usually pancho kohner  got a kick out of showing a weary looking  senior citizen aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what  but the shoddy craftsmanship  and terrible scripts  of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated    kinjite    the last of these films   is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness  in this film bronson  sodomizes a perverse john  forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch  allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner  makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i ve thankfully forgotten  also depicted is the gang rape of a young japanese girl  fortunately  this was off screen  though well implied   what were people thinking when they made this film  what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films  for anyone interested in his best movies  check out most of the films he made in the  s and  s like  the mechanic   death wish   from noon til    once upon a time in the west   red sun   the great escape   the magnificent seven   rider on the rain  etc  etc
