max had the v  trace  wheels of fires last and only hero  has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland  be amazed as mad max    aka the road warrior  is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work   why is wof set in a post apocalyptic wasteland  simple  the road warrior was  actually any questions can be answered by  it was that way in the road warrior  except for the out of work mutant actors from the original  s the time machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes   in typical  s fashion  all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion  inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them  along with this  s cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film  generally i waited for trace s rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough  which comes off more as him looking constipated  badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker  the unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin   rats  nights of terror by bruno mattei is superior  and that in and of itself is saying a lot  by this count   texas gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to wheels of fire  a poor road warrior knock off that doesn t have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable
