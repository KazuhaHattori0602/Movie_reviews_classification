i ve seen some bad things in my time  a half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud  a head on collision between two cars  a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor  human beings living like animals   but never in my life have i seen anything as bad as the cat in the hat   this film is worse than   worse than hitler  worse than vllad the impaler  worse than people who put kittens in microwaves   it is the most disturbing film of all time  easy   i used to think it was a joke  some elaborate joke and that mike myers was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie who lost a bet or something   i shudder
