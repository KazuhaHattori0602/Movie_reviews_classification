the first ten minutes of  just looking  really dictates the direction most of this movie takes  lenny  ryan merriman  is a   year old boy living in new york in the  s  he has a burning desire to see two people have sex  who are the best people he has in mind  well  his own mom and stepfather of course  how pleasant  unfortunately for lenny  he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle s wife   lenny s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex  however  the wife is quite pregnant and they aren t currently sleeping together  then lenny makes a new friend  him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls  they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex  the problem is it s not done in an innocent  charming  s sort of way  i am no prude by any means  but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation  blowjobs and anal sex  that kind of rawness may work in a movie like  kids    but in this film it just seems perverted   gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy  a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny s carnal desires  jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director s chair as possible   for better or worse    was awful and now this  what a waste
