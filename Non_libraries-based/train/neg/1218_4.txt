so this is what actress kim basinger has succumbed to  mmm
 to tell the truth the film s title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic  but simplicity can have its strengths  anyhow by the end of  while she was out  i was left feeling rather indifferent  not the worse  despite being engulfed by negatives  but there s easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm  but compact and unbalanced late night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid  when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park   the problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material  taken from a short story  along with the very variable performances  the flimsy script was poorly thought out  which isn t so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off  so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events  as for the bunch of stereotypical goons  led by an unconvincing lukas hass as a loose canon  terrorizing basinger  well they were less than threatening  but hopelessly clueless  watching basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand  don t ask me why  knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn t elicit tension or emotion
 but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up  basinger s performance is stout like  but doesn t craft much empathy  craig sheffer shows up as her hot headed husband  strangely i couldn t keep my eyes off the screen
 thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic  why would she be constantly carrying it  and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug
 her choices were quite disappointing  watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty  due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead   susan montford s soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy  as it pretty much chugs along  i liked the opening credits though  with its hauntingly sullen score  which is the most effective thing throughout the feature  and polished photography   no great shakes  doesn t ask much of your time  but i wouldn t care to see it again  however with the inclusion of a joy division song  it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen
