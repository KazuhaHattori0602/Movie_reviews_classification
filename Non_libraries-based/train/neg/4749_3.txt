this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep   minutes through the movie  the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles  it is too far fetched and at some points  ridiculous  if you are   or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed  but if you are   or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts  which i might add are poorly done  and wish you were some warrior to  the casting in this movie wasn t very good  and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn t fit at all  on a scale of     being excellent    being horrible  the acting in this movie is a   brenda song is talented in comedy  but with this kind of movie  in some of the more serious scenes  her acting was laughable  when she made some of her  fighting  poses  i started laughing out loud  i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing  for example  the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing  how her voice turns dark and evil  i think that was incredibly stupid  and how wendy s  brenda song teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks  that was pretty ridiculous to  so to sumamrize it all  a disappointing movie  but okay if you re   or under
