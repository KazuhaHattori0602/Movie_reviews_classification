timberlake s performance almost made attack the screen  it wasn t all bad  i just think the reporters role was wrong for him   ll cool j played the typical rapper role  toughest baddest guy around  i don t think the cracked a smile in the whole movie  not even when proposed to his girlfriend   morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie  he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie   kevin spacey wasn t good or bad he was just  there   overall it s a dull movie  bad plot  a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors
