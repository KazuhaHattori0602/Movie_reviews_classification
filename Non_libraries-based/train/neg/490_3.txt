artemesia takes the usual story about the art world  eg   you can t paint that  but i want to  and plasters it with sex and scandal to make the whole film  well  interesting  but not remarkable   the story is about one of the first female painters around  artemesia who course  is fiercely independent  but just can t stop thinking of men  and their bodies
 for artistic purposes of course  she soon gets private tutoring from one of a well known artist  but soon tutoring becomes much more then art  and soon after that  scandal erupts  funny how they could take a historical biography and make it almost into a soft porn fantasy  i mean  was artemesia that much of a man hungry person  also  it s quite funny when she s insisting that she  paints for herself  yet falls for the first person she sees   actually  the story itself is quite fascinating  and it ends with a trial  which i always love  but i wasn t too crazy about the male lead who played her teacher  who looked rather like the person someone like that wouldn t fall for  i woulda gone for the young fisherman  p
