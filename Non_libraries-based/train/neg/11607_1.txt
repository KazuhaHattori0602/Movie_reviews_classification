i found horrorvision almost unwatchable  while only   minutes in length i still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again  the acting was of the `if i scream and say  k a lot i m intense  school  and the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out   while i never go to full moon for great film making i have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this
