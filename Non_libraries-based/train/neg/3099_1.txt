this movie is not just bad  not just corny  it is repulsive  something about daphne  about the creepy call girl  about the whole damn  and i use the word literally  film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress  this film makes my skin crawl  makes me regret having reproductive organs  and makes me feel unclean   one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept  a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results  rather than the clich  worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish  is a truly fascinating film idea   thought  the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights  during the day  bright lights don t show up well  so they could go anywhere   count the hobgoblins  four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio  and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed throughout the course of the movie   discussion question  if you had a frigid  demanding  unappreciative girlfriend  would you enter garden tool combat with a military chunkhead  explain
