this movie was based on actual fact  i sincerely hope not   we get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at   guys who only got armored torso s  that s a great idea  aim for the armor excuse me  but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud  or were there invisible tanks protecting them  were they from crypton did i miss something here   this movie started out decent enough but after   minutes of shoot out it really takes a turn to boringlane   and that documentary style didn t work for me either  but thats just something one finds likable or not   highly unbelievable stuff which makes it hard to see it through  til the end     for the fine editing
