who did the research for this film  it s set in baghdad in   however all the soldiers are wearing acus and have all universal camouflage pattern gear  no one was wearing that stuff in     i just saw this film while deployed overseas and i can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was wtf  this movie made no sense  had characters come and go with no explanation  and people doing ridiculous things that would never happen in real life  i realize that it s a movie  but it s obviously trying to portray something realistic  it fails miserably  but it s trying    it s like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas  chewed them up and swallowed  then vomited out a film  i would not recommend this film to anyone  i m still not sure why i sat through the whole thing  gi joe was one that really made you think compared to this  stay away
