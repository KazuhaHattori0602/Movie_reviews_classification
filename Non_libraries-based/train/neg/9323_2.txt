what did i just watch  i spent   minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i ve ever seen  the concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite scary seeing is there are a lot of people who are afraid of clowns but having it be a   pound nursery rhyme reciting killer clown makes a mockery of the genre  i still am wondering how the character mark wasn t able to run away from the clown he s   pounds  he s gotta get tired eventually  the whole ending made me get up and literally say aloud  what did i just watch  apparently brandon is denise s cousin  and they had got it on near the middle of the movie meaning he had sex with his cousin yeah that s something people want so see  shudders   another thing i found hilariously stupid was the opening scene where the clown stabs a woman and she says  what did you do  well bytch  what do you think he just did  the last thing that was stupidly funny was one second the main character was slapping the hitch hiker and calling her a c nt and then   minutes later saying violence isn t helping anything did the writer of the script give the line to the wrong guy  none of this movie makes sense anyway   the movie was more or less a dumb low budget porno which i got sucked into buying  all  and got no entertainment out of it besides the sex scenes  i m surprised the fat clown didn t join the orgy  would have fit right in  i hoped the movie would have some entertainment value like other b movies might have  but i was wrong  this is a moronic piece of garbage that s not even worth watching     out of
