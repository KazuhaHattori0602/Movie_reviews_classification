all these reviewers are spot on  i ve seen many bad films over the years  believe me  and this beats the lot   this is not just a  so bad it s good  exploiter waste of time  but a genuine  hilarious  movie atrocity   check out the white furry monster type thing   wet yourself laughing at thom christopher s  spell weaving  acting   gape in sheer a e clenching disbelief  at the threadbare sets   this is one of those  european co productions  no wonder we have so many wars  i swear  some of the people taking part in  wizards of the lost kingdom  aren t actually aware they are appearing in a film   fact  i originally watched this movie on htv wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation  i had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful  it is  worse even than lee majors in the norseman  more laughable than all of john derek s films  this is  truly  the citizen kane of trash
