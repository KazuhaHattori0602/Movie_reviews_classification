i just rented creep and was not at all impressed  i didn t feel anything in this film  i felt sick because the gore alone was shocking   i walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film  haven t we seen this all before  i didn t like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage  i felt bad for him  but then again i couldn t think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the creep  so many questions need to be answered   someone mentioned references to the ps  game silent hill and i can see similarities vaguely   not a bad film  not a good one  judge for yourself
