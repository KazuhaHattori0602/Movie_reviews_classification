 the bubble  is an effort to make a gay romeo   juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian  although it seems to come at it by way of  friends  or  beverly hills   the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line  the movie seems torn between fluff and depth  on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as  in one example of many  some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand  and get answers like   hey  we re here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation  don t get political  beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line  it s just one of many ham fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests  on the other hand  the movie s main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of  bent  a play about gays in a nazi labor camp  the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed  undermining its erotic power  understandable given the constraints of film time  but still this could have been edited to much better effect  and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film  too bad  this play deserves much better   the characters are so one dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire  though the word seems inappropriate here  substance  the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named  golan  the militant palestinian is named  jihad  the striving for chic faghag roommate is  lulu  anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine  whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as
 well  the rest of this fluffy fantasy  when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful  an ambulance shows up in minutes   the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac  altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance  not the series of bone numbing  soul crushing  humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth  death  or severe illness  ashraf  the palestinian lover  seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems  no papers  no hassles  he just shows up whenever he likes  when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardo   against the backdrop of nice  supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose   except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers   gay israeli palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleem s  salaam shalom  so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think   gloriously bad films   like the works of ed wood   at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them  this one doesn t even have that going for it  most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes  and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes  the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tv movie of the week
