jesus christ  i can t believe i ve wasted my time watching this movie  i only watched because i have such a crush on jordan ladd  but watching this film almost put me off her  this is absolutely awful  i could have been watching survivor series   over this   the lead guy in this was so bland and generic  i would love it if the great mistuharu misawa tiger drove  d his ass through a glass window  i was enraging every time he was saying  lake  and  cabin  i d kick his ass   jordan ladd  on the other hand  was absolutely wonderful  a true angel  but she couldn t even save this utter joke of a film  sadly  she couldn t even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug  it looked hilarious   i also loved the bit where jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her  it reminded me of a time where nevermind   anayways  do watch this film because of it s awfulness
