ok  i love bad horror  i especially love horror bad enough to make fun of  demonicus  or house of the dead   those were bad enough to make fun of  severed was not   it was worse    spoilers   who cares   my friend and i sat through the entire film  and i have a number of comments  both in the  this sucks  style and in the realm of actual critiques   plot  sort of    there s a guy in this city  which is possibly seattle  see comment below  who is running around and cutting off heads  he s been doing this for over a year  i m not going back to get exact numbers   thank you very much  possibly two or three years  one head a week  and the police are just now calling in a  specialist   who once refers to himself as a psychic  but that never comes up again   schya right  feds take over after  what  three connected homicides  after nearly a hundred similar killings we d be under freaking martial law   anyway  this  specialist  consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time  and the two of them come to the conclusion that it s baron samedi  a voodoo spirit  who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body  and then presumably take over the world   or possibly just go to disneyland   um   setting   where is this happening  well  if you re not from seattle  you might not realize that at the bar rave  occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members  there s a poster for a local radio station  and that in the highly entertaining   pulp fiction esqe dialog  as if  between the two cops  yes  the ones who get their heads cut off about   minutes into the flick  they discuss  the new stadium  which may still have been an issue when this movie was made   being from seattle  i apologize on the movie s behalf and hang my head in shame   ok  here s where it gets really critical   being a horror movie writer  not published  don t go looking for my name in the imdb  i do research  lots of research  and unlike the writers of this movie  i know that baron samedi   while a voudon loa  spirit  who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated  by various christian oppressors  with  satan    is actually a  loki like trickster god    in other words  he doesn t cut off heads   besides  a major part of the voudoun religion is that baron samedi can have a body whenever he wants  their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa   not to mention  if he s already possessed someone  why make a new body   also  if baron samedi got a body  he wouldn t go around cutting off heads  he d get some good rum and cigars and par tay   in summary  the only thing they did get  surprisingly  right is that in the completely unnecessary tarot card reading  used only to show that the voodoo chick is  spooky  they didn t screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do  again  i ve done research   anyone remember the old late night ad for phone in tarot readings    the lovers   you will soon fall madly in love  and all that nonsense   if you made it this far through my comments  i congratulate you  and i m sorry again  i ll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me  so please don t
