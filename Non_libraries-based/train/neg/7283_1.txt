facts about national lampoon goes to the movies  a k a  national lampoon s movie madness     the movie is poor  even by lampoon s typical standards    it s not funny    no one goes to see a movie   so  after i finished watching it  i began wondering why on earth it s called  national lampoon goes to the movies  and why it was ever conceived  much less actually made  it would be like calling austin powers  an american guy goes to the movies  how lame  he isn t american  and he doesn t go to movies  none of the characters in lampoon s so called  satire  are funny  and none go see movies  which causes a bit of a problem  i had hoped it would be something in the vein of mystery science theater   but it isn t   this was national lampoon s first film after animal house  although you couldn t tell it from the quality of film  poorly developed  rough and amateurish by any standard  it induces headaches   not a good sign for an  minute movie that seems double the length   i ve noticed a pattern  really bad movies are typically renamed   and this little disaster falls under that category  it has two separate titles   probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in    hmm  movie madness   i ve never heard of this movie before  let s rent it  and then  the realization   hey  wait a minute  this is just national lampoon goes to the movies   it was shelved by mgm ua  never to be released into theaters or dvd  it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade  which is just about the only place you ll manage to find it   it s split up into three stories   a parody of self enlargement videos  butter and corporate ruthlessness  and police brutality cop buddy films  i guess  the first segment stars peter riegert  animal house  as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff  i m not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift  until the sex scene popped up   part ii is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter  don t ask  who decides to become queen of the margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products  ouch  this contains the only funny line in the movie   only i can make love with my son  if you think that doesn t sound very funny  you re right   it s not  and just imagine   it s the highlight of this film   part iii is about a cop who chases down a serial killer  christopher lloyd  only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy  it does contain one funny scene but it s extremely over acted   only lloyd really exhibits any humor  playing his character dry and compassionate  yet strangely surreal  the part where he s choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold  at least  evoked a chuckle or two   it s a shame to watch such a cast of semi famous names resort to low standards  the writers of each segment clearly believe that they re being very ironic and clever by spoofing so called stereotypes   the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction  favoring the standard t   a instead of plot  crude humor instead of witty dialogue  desperate performances instead of inspired ones  it s easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material  muttering their lines  often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera   the movie isn t funny  as i said before  i laughed once  at only one line  and even then it was a halfhearted one  two chuckles  a smile  and a very weak laugh  compared to movie madness  a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks   i like national lampoon s vacation series  or  at least three of four installments  and their classic animal house  but their recent slew of direct to video bombs such as golf punks  with that great comic genius tom arnold  provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago  it gets really old  really fast   sad to see a new film  called gold diggers  is being released with their  stamp of approval  it s like condemning a film before it even hits theaters   maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place
  distributor   this movie is bad  it gets the national lampoon stamp of approval  that ll teach you not to make something so awful next time   forget the death penalty  just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month   it s so bad that i can t even begin to explain its putrid vileness  i give up
