incredibly muddled  off putting and ultimately ludicrous  the horses  oh my god  the horses  thriller  it s creepy at times  but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film  watch how in the final   minutes everybody  magically  does exactly what the plot needs for the  resolution  to occur  bland performances by the leads  a typically eccentric one by richard lynch  the video transfer is a real hack job  cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand    out of   stars
