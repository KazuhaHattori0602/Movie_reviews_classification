where to start         i feel   violated  thats right  violated  i just spent  hrs of my life   hrs that i could have spent doing something more useful  like watching paint dry  on this so called horror flick   its not scary  its not funny  its not dramatic  its no action  its nothing   its predictable  its boring  its tragic   i might come of a bit harsh here  but watch this movie and you will feel the same way   or   no  don t watch it unless you want to feel violated also
