im proud to say i ve seen all three fast and furious films sure the plots are kinda silly and they might be a little cheesy but i love them car chases and all the beautiful cars and the clandestine midnight races and ill gladly see a fourth one   wanna know what the difference is between those three and redline decent acting somewhat thought out plot even if they are potboilers and last but not least directors who have a clue all three were made by very competent directors all of them took the films in a different direction equally exciting redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch and made them the extras then picked up his leads from hollywood s unemployment line and the script yikes its mystery science theatre   bad this is  s made for tv movie bad   yeah the movie had a few cool cars but you don t really get to see that many in action and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases and if the cars aren t thrilling you why go to a movie like this   im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers and i cant stop laughing out loud im getting dirty looks but this was just a debacle   rent the f f movies go to nascar race go to a karting track and race yourself whatever you do avoid redline like bad cheese
