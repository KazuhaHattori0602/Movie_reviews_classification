the title should have been the walker  the guy expend   of the movie walking  he doesn t know what he wants  or what he is  go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing  he gets no benefit  no money  nothing pretending to be another person   no body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else   the only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son  but the rest was crap   may be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else  but what he really should do is to get a real job  because after his movie  i don t think he has a chance to make as a movie producer
