this movie was so very badly written  the characters had no depth  they should have never made a movie of this  my   yr old son could write a better screenplay then hyung rae shim   the only actor that didn t suck was the zoo guard  he was the only funny and believable one of the lot   i love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt  but this one was up there on my lame list at number   number   being demonicus   for those of you who actually thought this was a good movie  you are in serious need of brain surgery   most of the creatures in the movie weren t even dragons so why did they call d war
