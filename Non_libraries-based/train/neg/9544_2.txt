i didn t enjoy this film  i thought the acting wasn t very good and the story was boring  a  year old computer saving the day  i thought that this was just slightly far fetched  even for a film  i couldn t figure out why they couldn t just turn it off  why not take a sledgehammer to it   its a shame  but after the original film from the  s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered  this film could have been a  st century version of the old film  it wasn t  if that is what you want to watch  do not watch this film    even if the old computer hadn t have turned up to save day  this would still  in my opinion  be a very very cheesy flick
