no  it s not the horror movie this one is actually a love story   the ring is a silent film from   that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them  she loves the boxer known as  one round  jack  she loves him until the champion comes along  that is  even though she marries one round  she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between one round and the champion  she comes back to one round s corner  just when things look their bleakest  and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back   this film was very early in hitch s career  but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film  although there are special film tricks  and some comedy relief  this film just does not hold up to any of his later work  it must have been extremely risqu  for the time period though  with the shameless adulterous wife  that may have been the draw back in   while looking through all of these old films  it is amazing how i think that they could be redone on today s screen and really come off  maybe i should be the one   skip this movie unless you are planning on watching all of hitchcock s films  you could fall asleep in the middle
