i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week  my   year old son was looking forward to it too  i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen   boy  was i disappointed  this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable  george c  scott is an excellent actor but in this  it seemed that he was fully into character only about   of the time  the rest of the time he was quite flat   i realize that this was made in   pre cg effects  for the most part  but it looked to be very b movie quality  especially the encounter with jacob marley   the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story  when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world  observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime   i will admit that mr  scott did a good job with the  reformed  scrooge at the end  that was a refreshing portrayal   i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down trodden  and tiny tim  oh don t even get me started on bad child actors
