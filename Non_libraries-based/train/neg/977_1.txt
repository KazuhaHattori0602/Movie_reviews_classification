 fever pitch  isn t a bad film  it s a terrible film   is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they ll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs  that s the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy  and i use that term loosely because there s nothing funny in this film  is getting good reviews   i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny   the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film  he adapted  fever pitch  for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in   peter hedges found hornby s voice for  about a boy    and when  high fidelity  was americanized for a movie in   writers d v  devincentis  steve pink  john cusack and scott rosenberg didn t go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby s wit and humor  they made one of the best films of that year   so why does the american version of  fever pitch  go so painfully awry  the british version wasn t a masterpiece  but it was charming  funny  unexpected and gave us two characters we could like  respect and understand   but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby s work  in americanizing the story  they ve butchered it  removing all that was good and unique about hornby s work and replacing it with conventional drivel   they ve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy  never once veering from the wretched formula  lindsey  drew barrymore  has three girlfriends  each of whom has a distinct function  one s overweight  the second s cynical and ambitious  and the third s a romantic  want to guess how many male friends ben  jimmy fallon  has   what made  high fidelity  such fun was not only a good leading man and lady  but engaging supporting characters  in this  fever pitch  the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny  they re so insignificant  they re not even decorative  the only reason they re in the film is because the formula demands it  poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey s pals in a thankless role  the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away  come to think of it  cusack would ve made an excellent ben  of course  cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script   there isn t a single  solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced  every plot turn is predictable  every lame joke telegraphed  ganz and mandel labor for laughs  the first   minutes are so excruciatingly slow  you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy  you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch  it s almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru s formula pasted on the wall  when they got to a certain page  they looked up at the formula and said   ok  the guru says this has to happen now  and  presto   directors bobby and peter farrelly don t help the film any  they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters  they hand over the v o  narration not to the protagonist  but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park  thanks to some extremely clunky writing  we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings   barrymore does cute and adorable better than most  she s as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday  but even her cuteness can t save this extraordinarily awful film  she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story  about   minutes into the film  lindsey tells ben   you re funny  the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script  for fallon s ben never says anything even remotely funny  fallon is neither witty nor funny  when he does comedy  he overacts   fallon was never any good on  saturday night live  he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show  remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices  the only reason  weekend update  worked occasionally was because fallon s cohort  tina fey  knows a thing or two about comedy   actors who think they re funny and behave that way rarely  if ever  are actually funny  that s true of fallon  he thinks he s hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle  his stuttering  unsure of himself shtick didn t work on the small screen  it s lousier on the big screen   unfortunately for fallon  his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments  if you thought his comedy was bad  wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff  two scenes in particular   the first in a park  the second in front of ben s school   are painful to watch  the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability  but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work  his range of emotions doesn t even run the gamut from a to b   ben has no personality or depth  often  he comes across as an oaf  and not a lovable one at that  it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him  compare fallon s performance to firth s in the british version  and you ll understand how terribly flat  unfunny and forced fallon s ben is and how wrong he is for this role  watching fallon in  fever pitch  makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher   just as  high fidelity  did  an americanized  fever pitch  could ve worked brilliantly  it just needed better writers  more competent directors and  most definitely  a stronger  funnier  smarter leading man  do yourself a huge favor  avoid this rotten film  rent the   british version and read hornby s book  instead
