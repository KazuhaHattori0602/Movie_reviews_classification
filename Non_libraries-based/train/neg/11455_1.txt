first off  to give you some idea of my taste in movies     comedies i enjoyed  superbad  knocked up  hot fuzz  blades of glory     comedies i hated  evan almighty  the brothers solomon  good luck chuck  i should have followed my first instinct and turned off  hot rod  after i got to about the   minute mark  i knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once  the script is absolutely brutal   i have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack   on imdb  any one older than   years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective   this doesn t come close to anything with will farrell and it s clear that andy samberg can t carry anything longer than a   to   minute sketch on youtube or snl  i don t know how they roped ian mcshane and isla fisher into doing this movie  they must have owed favors or something  i came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie  but i thought it would at least be funny  i didn t so much as smirk   i don t normally comment on movies at imdb  but this was so awful  i just had to warn people  this is only the  th movie i ve seen that i ve felt compelled to rate
