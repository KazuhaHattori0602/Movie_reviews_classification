this is not really a zombie film  if we re defining zombies as the dead walking around  here the protagonist  armand louque  played by an unbelievably young dean jagger  gains control of a method to create zombies  though in fact  his  method  is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people s minds turning them into hypnotized slaves  this is an interesting concept for a movie  and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of  dr  mabuse  films  including  dr  mabuse the gambler    and  the testament of dr  mabuse    here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fianc e  claire duvall  played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo  dorothy stone  which is really the major theme   the movie has an intriguing beginning  as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there  at some type of compound  where we get great  s sets and clothes  he announces his engagement to claire  and then barely five minutes later  she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal  clifford greyson  robert noland  it s unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact  this would have been a great movie for  mystery science theater   if they hadn t already roasted it   it s never shown how louque actually learns the  zombification  secret  but he then uses it to kill his enemies  create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards  we won t see such sheer force of will until john agar in  the brain from planet arous     finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america  louque agrees  but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves  on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his  powers  to gain her love  he does so  causing the  revolt  of the title  in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him  greyson embraces claire  and we seem to be at the end of a parable   whom the gods would destroy  they first make mad    so really then  it s not that bad of a film  despite the low imdb rating it currently has  on repeated viewings   one can see the artistry in the well formed script  dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor  and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness   is that really his own hair  we remember him more for his bald  old man roles in  white christmas     x the unknown    and  king creole    the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better  earlier film  white zombie    in which hapless robert frazier  as charles beaumont  uses  zombification  to win the love of madge bellamy  as madeline parker   if you want real zombie movies  of which there are hundreds  i d start with  white zombie     king of the zombies     i walked with a zombie     night of the living dead     the last man on earth    and its two remakes  in the modern era of classy films  there are  horror express     the serpent and the rainbow      days later    and its sequel  as well as many  many  others too numerous to mention   this one is not really a zombie film  judging this movie on its own terms  it s more of a semi gothic romance  as such it ranks a little below some of universal s bottom billed b horror movies of the late  s and early  s  so i ll give it a
