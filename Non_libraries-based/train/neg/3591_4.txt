first off  let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff  i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled  star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts  so i have a soft spot for fanpro stuff that means i ll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly   so on to st  hf  well  first off the good things  enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and  for the most part  the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles  next  the effects aren t bad for a home brew effort  with nothing to make you really wince  the stories aren t too bad either  nothing particularly innovative  but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story arcs   but it has a lot of faults   first off  although they quite obviously have to rip off star trek footage  set backdrops  music and effects  i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci fi musical score ever made  everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another  likewise  much of the footage is from other movies  dutifully cgi d over to make it look different  the grey warships  for instance  though disguised  are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars  and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers  likewise  sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters  as does animated over footage  in one scene in either first or second season  i think  you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle  which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours   acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch  everyone does improve as the seasons progress  though  but expect to grimace at the screen a lot  especially in the early seasons  they ve also made some interesting acting choices  let s just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to  cake  and leave it at that   make up effects are generally quite effective on the whole  but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or  passing  shots  they are just beyond unrealistic  every time i saw one of these  apart from trying not to laugh too much  i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that  this is a stick up  in one scene a  cardassian  actually talks whilst wearing one of these  not only do the lips not move  but the mask doesn t even have an opening where the mouth should be  someone needs to be slapped hard for that  couldn t they have taken a craft knife to it  for goodness  sake  there are also some well done  but unintentionally funny make up jobs  such as the herman munster look alike   the writing  though coherent  is nothing new  instead the script runs like a continuation of ds  with the ships heading out from ds  on various missions  the new enemy   the grey  aren t very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads  i e  starfleet meet the grey  the grey are hugely powerful  starfleet barely escape with their lives  then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc  all done before with the borg   another bone of contention is the dialogue  star trek writers have long had the ability to write  insert technobabble here  into a script  it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using  quantum phase discriminators  or  isolytic charges  etc  in other words  nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand   the words are just gibberish really  i ve no problem with this  but where st hf makes a mess of it is where they include real world comments into this concept   tactical advice such as  we need to regroup  sounds good  but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group  likewise when asked what the situation is  a tactical officer is heard to reply  we count three battleships  he actually needed to count them  c mon  i expected the questioner to ask him  are you sure  or  can you double check  but my all time favourite comment is this    captain   can we establish two way communication   comms officer   no  we can only send and receive   well  duh   having said all the above  the show does improve as it goes along  seasons   and   are pretty bad    shows an improvement but       are where it starts to get noticeably better  season   so far looks quite reasonable   i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though  quicktime sucks  quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx avi format the better  some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor  not only does quicktime make this difficult  but the  x  resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well  in fact  it makes the shows pretty unwatchable  like they were a tenth generation vhs tape copy  the least they could do was to include a hi res downloadable option   anyway  the show has promise  and i m even beginning to like some of the characters  but that s   episodes on  so i m not sure this says that much about character development at all   but what can you say  it s free   ps  out of   votes    people rated this show as a   or   hmmmm  were we watching the same show  or are you   all three year olds
