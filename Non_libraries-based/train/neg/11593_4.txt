i consider this film one of the worst in the nightmare series  it was so boring that i couldn t remember a thing   minutes after the film was over  it even tires me to write a review on it   okay    was a joke and freddy was the joker    tried to return to the roots of the series  it was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare   which is a good thing  basically  they tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy  unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares  because of that nightmare   the dream child is neither funny nor is it scary  what we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors  maybe with the exception of lisa wilcox   the plot  freddy killing lisa s friends by using the dreams of lisa s unborn child  has a good base but it just isn t enough for   minutes of film  sometimes the story gets very confusing  maybe because there isn t any  and you can t stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at  the screenplay must have had more holes than swiss cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself  let me say that i don t like cheese though  even if i am from switzerland  not even the special effects were as good as for example in part    don t bother to rent buy this film if not for completeness  it s quite a mess   my rating     get used to it    is also a messy one
