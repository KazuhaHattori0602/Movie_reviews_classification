what an unusual movie   absolutely no concessions are made to  hollywood special effects  or entertainment  there is no background music  not special effects or enhanced sound   facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire   i sort of viewed these movies  parts   and   as an educational experience  not really something to go and get entertained by  its quite long and in places dull   but i suspect that given the lack of any plot development  i don t think its very educational either   its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue   it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening  since for some reason the director didn t see fit to inform the audience why che s band was moving around the way they did   as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at   i would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character  but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end  the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare
