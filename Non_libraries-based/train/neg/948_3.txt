i ve tried to watch this show several times  but for a show called  that  s show  i don t find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the  s   the decade in which i grew up  of the episodes i have seen  most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period  take away the novelty of  supposedly  being set in the  s  and the show is neither interesting nor funny   if you re looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the  s  in my humble opinion you can do no better than  the wonder years
