  once i ignored some of the implausibilities  this was actually a fairly decent horror monster flick  so  i ll give some of the good points first    the dragon was quite convincing  especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch  hint  she likes humans    the action was fairly non stop  and  after a weak beginning  i got quite absorbed in the storyline    sorry to say  i was kind of rooting for the dragon   she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie   now for the implausible stuff  maybe some spoilers    if you were hunting a fire breathing dragon in   ad  would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm  duh    a female character with an all american name  blonde hair and obvious slavic accent  trying to pretend she s spanish  huh    a lead scientist whose slavic accent you can cut with a knife  and he s supposedly born in chicago  educated in usa    a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs  flies a huge transport copter with no other crew  and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot  ok  uh huh  i won t even mention his giving   different call signs in   minutes while communicating with his base   it s still better than some of the japanese monster flicks from the  s  but not by much  if we re lucky  we won t see dragon fighter   though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open  or  maybe  they ll hire a real director next time   in spite of everything  i gave this flick a   out of   add   more if they rewrite the plot  and dean cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes
