 it s this one  very cool premise  right off the bat   has an excellent first scene  gotta give credit where credit s due   has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me  whenever the ghosts appeared  which i really liked by the way  how it was done  how it looked the only thing was the ghost s relationship  because of the way things went down in the first scene you d think their dynamic would be different   things slowed down a little too much in the middle i felt  and the crab spider scene was just not good  but then the ending is actually very good  sure   the grudge  basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai s and that s what i liked about this movie comparatively   please  someone one with a tempered style remake this movie   fans of  silent rage  would absolutely love this movie
