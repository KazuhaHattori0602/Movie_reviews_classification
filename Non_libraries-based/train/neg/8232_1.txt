five across the eyes ain t worth one off the wrist  i must admit at one point i was really worried  for about   seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling  me and the speakers are ok now thanks for asking  funnily enough that was the best bit of the film   i won t waste your time telling you the plot  read the other comments for that   if you have bought this dvd but not yet unwrapped it don t  take it back and demand your money back  i ve wasted mine don t do the same   i was actually shouting at the telly   they re over here in the car  look for the camera lights  and get the camera man first   i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go   if anybody would like to buy this film  it s really good  it s yours for a ten quid
