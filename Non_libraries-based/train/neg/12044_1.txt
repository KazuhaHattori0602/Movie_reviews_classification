went to see the movie  troy  this afternoon  here s what i learned   contrary to popular opinion and history in general  greek men were not gay  ever  this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter  so it is safe for american dudes to see this movie   helen of troy always had impeccable hair and makeup  she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which  though numerous  were probably all filmed on the same day  one after the other  with the director saying   alright  now look beautiful       good   ok  now look frightened   good  now look depressed   good   now look interested       good   now look beautiful again   good   most greek and trojan men had british accents  those with american accents couldn t act   trojans looked just like greeks  but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen   brad pitt does not blink on camera   helen of troy s biggest line was   they re coming for me   trojan music sounded remarkably like modern bulgarian music   brad pitt s thighs go all the way up   achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close  but it s ok  they were cousins  never mind what history says   peter o toole can tell an entire story with just an expression   trojan gods apparently all had greek names  but their statues either looked egyptian or like peter o toole in drag   greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting  much like american men   all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color  light egyptian  by max factor   troy had only three women   there were lots of blond greeks  which is good news for brad pitt  who would otherwise have really stuck out   despite their coastal desert locale  greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires  funeral pyres  trojan horses and the like   british actors look silly with greek hairdos   brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes   greek soldiers fought constantly  but their outfits always looked impeccable   greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts   apparently greek temples were always in ruins  even back when they were all new
