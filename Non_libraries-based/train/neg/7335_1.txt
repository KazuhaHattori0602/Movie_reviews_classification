this is possibly the worst version of the play i have seen   several times on stage apart from the movie   a very nice idea for the set up   the american south can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round hero s supposed misdemeanour   but the execution  widdoes is a very mannered beatrice giving a particularly poor performance  waterston  a fine actor  is not much better as benedict   the poorest performance is in the role of don john   it makes keanu reeves look good  perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of dogberry and his men   but the acting makes you want to cringe   successful set ups include the scene where they fool benedict into believing beatrice loves him   were the acting competent it would be superb  but the use of the river and the visual humour of benedict moving closer is well produced   overall i had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn t keep my attention   very disappointing   with respect to latter comments above i am nearly   i ve been watching stage and screen productions of shakespeare for over   decades  might i suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact  i can assume though  from your distaste regarding youth  that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste   my personal favourite pairing was rylance and mcteer on the london stage  unlike widdoes  mcteer  a skilled and charismatic performer  can act
