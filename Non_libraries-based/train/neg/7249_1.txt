this movie rivals  plan   as one of the dumbest movie ever made  always be concerned when the same person is the     star   director   producer   writer   stuntman  and   editor  unfortunately  justin kreinbrink did all   jobs  imdb shows that he and his father were western  stunt men  so maybe that was the problem    here s just one example from the film  in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection  of course  the bad guys find out and are waiting for them  but  what happens  the good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them  when the camera shows us the bad guys they re all just sitting on a log  chatting  what s wrong with this picture   i could go on  perhaps this film was meant as a comedy  if so  it didn t do that well either
