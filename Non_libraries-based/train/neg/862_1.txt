 succubus  the edited version of  necronomicon getr umte s nden  is a struggle to sit through  even at a lean   minutes  any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious euro horror tripe and i may have slipped into a coma   jess franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of  s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on class a hallucinogenics  since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever  apparently  this is one of the better of his   films   it s hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there   the unfathomable plot deals with franco s usual themes of sex  violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of s m for good measure  and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious   i may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy euro horror again   life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this
