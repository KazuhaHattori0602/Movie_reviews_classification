another priyadarshan vohra flick another movie that was seen for tp rather than actual desire  the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie  akshay paresh and many others  but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie   i was happy with the casting in general except  rajpal yadav who once again annoys to no limit  he does however extract some laughs  but these were those standard slapstick non original jokes  in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol  i mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise  or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it  its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner  for an extended period who are considered great   which brings us to the other instrument  the dumroo hardly requires any talent  it has no variations  and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances  hmm sounds like rajpal yadav  good analogy  but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the dhol does   this movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played  sometimes the dhol was played sometimes the dumroo  sometimes both together  but mostly the dumroo played alone and the monkey danced  and like any   year old sooner than later i got bored   the movie has some good dhol  good  moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying dumroo  entertaining initially  then tolerable then irritating  the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on  mere bhains ko anda kyun mara   if you haven t watched it watch it on filmy  it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny   this movie had its moments  the actors did a fine job  except rajpal yadav  who can act though  i ve seen him in main meri patni
  who annoys more than entertains  i ve said it many time and i ll say it again i really think sharman joshi and tushar kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi star comedies especially   some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father  the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other   but after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added  this mean that once the girl was in  the following   mins was increasingly torturous  the climax was  so bad its almost good category  i mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable   the movie is also extremely predictable  there s hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here  its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag   the movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump  down or up  and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl   most of the really bad scenes were towards the end  one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy  also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition  the last   was especially distatefull and completely spoils this movie   i didn t find tanushree datta quite the siren she was to play  and her acting talent is in serious question  especially in view of her non appealing looks  if you cant be a hot and cant act how much time can you survive   technically also this movie was weak  with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera work   the songs except the title track were no good either  when the songs played in the  nd half i could feel the collective gasp from the audience   in all a movie that s just ordinary merely because of the cast  and the very low expectations   avoiding it wont be a bad idea   and if it has to be watched watching it on tv for free or a very cheap matin e or something is a must  if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed    s lots of stale jokes  rajpal yadav  last   mins and last   mins especially  bad technically  bad songs    s tries to be more than what it was  not the regular cast  i m happier for it  tanushree datta    s some good scenes towards the beginning title song  good acting and cast except ry   total    i m trying to be objective here  i don t like rajpal yadav or tanushree datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations  so i m giving it the benefit of all doubts  on absolute terms this movie was not more than a
