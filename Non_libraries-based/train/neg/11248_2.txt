a gave it a   instead of a    awful  because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning  a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork  but that wasn t enough to save it   the  sepia  toned  washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies  nothing new there  i can see there were some hat tips to other old  classic movies  ok  no problem with that   but a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting  not something that would put you to sleep   the story line and the script of this movie was awful  the characters two dimensional  slow moving  some of the scenes were pretty to look at  but ultimately  as a whole  it was quite boring  i couldn t recommend it
