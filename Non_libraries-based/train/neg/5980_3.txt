there s a group of fox tv executives sitting around a boardroom table wondering what new show to commission     how about aiming for something like   or the west wing  says one of them  but they all agree it would be too expensive  and cheap tv is less likely to harm the station if it flops     well  how about getting together some great comedy writers and doing a quality sitcom  offers another and is fired on the spot   don t you know good writers cost lots of money  the big chief barks   that s why we invented reality tv    we could do yet another crime drama  suggests a man in a bland suit   i m listening  the boss replies  suddenly interested   people like csi  so let s do another copy of that  blandman adds    but there are already far too many csi clones out there  what can we do to make ours stand out  a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly   stand out  if we do that people may be confused  let s give them more of what they already like  the big chief screams     let s just add more violence and make it really grisly  we are fox after all  another suit suggests to a hearty reply of  now you re getting it  from the big chief   we could make them the deviant crimes unit  he goes on to add  clearly on a roll     by jove  he s got it  the big chief laughs   and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen   well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts  blandman points out     then it s settled  we just need a name  the big chief announces   we could call it sex cops violence     too literal  how about killer instinct
it conveys violence  but sounds a bit like basic instinct which had lots of sex     puuurfect  the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel arrested development
