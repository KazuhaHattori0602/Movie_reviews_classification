ugh  another one of those  fooled by the cover  dvds  i expected some kind of action at least with bears  cats    such on the cover  i got nothing  bad movie   i forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually something would happen no luck   now the reason i gave this a   is because of the scenery  otherwise it sucked   the kid was terrible  talking to himself  although i suppose they couldn t just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all  doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump  threatening a raccoon  munching on worms  and  what a dumbass  kicking a porcupine  and he wouldn t be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks  at least he fought the bear  weakly  a couple of times   what was up with the flashback thing  it made a bad movie even worse  i wanted to see a survival movie  not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce   what else can i say  well  maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something  at least that would have been more exciting   people  don t waste your time on this one
