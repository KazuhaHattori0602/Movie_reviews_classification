while william shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in   and i especially love him as denny crane in boston legal  well  this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down   it has none of the intelligence of millionaire  none of the flair of deal or no deal   this show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time   i watched it of course just to check it out  i did watch it for over   minutes  then i had to turn it off   the best part of it was william shatner dancing on the stage  he is a hoot  unfortunately  this show will not make it   that s a given
