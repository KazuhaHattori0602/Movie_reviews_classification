in   paperhouse was hailed as a  thinking man s horror film  wow  you might say  sign me up  this thing is a mess  it features a one time young actress who has a range of like   to   g  headley with a bad british  dubbed  accent  and a story with no chills  thrills or spills   it isn t even interesting psycho babble  one will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of leprechaun    the story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams  what you get isn t good horror  art house or even a decent after school special  i found myself after the two hour point saying where did my two hours go   the direction is uninspired and i wished it could even be pretentious something interesting it seems like the producers were on lithium   even in the dream world things are boring   a short no on this one
