it could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of america s most notorious serial killers  but sadly it doesn t even come close  terrible editing  direction  bad acting  you name it  this movie is literally about   minutes of plot stretched into   the only redeeming quality is bruce davidson as the father  but that s not nearly enough to save this stinker  a   out of
