this movie should have never been made   what a shame of the budget   please hire convincing actors  and make a proper movie  very thin plot  and unconvincing lines  almost hilarious  and that is a shame for an action movie    definitely not worth watching   they keep replaying the same  shots  of an stealth airplane flying away  you have seen it ones  and that was not worth re running   or   times   it is time for steven seagal to retire from movie making   his movies are getting worser every time   black dawn  and submerged were already bad  but this movie is even worse
