great cast  great acting  unpredictable story line for the first half  hour or so  i was really wanting to know what was going to  happen to each of these unredeeming characters  and how their  seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined  but when  the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players  they  mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill  for the last two hours  i kept thinking it would get better  but it only  got worse  don t believe the reviews  this is a waste of time    think about it   tom cruise made ugly   why  the gorgeous  hunky bartender wearing braces   why  i know it had to do with  the plot  but without them  at least there would have been one  attractive cast member to remember
