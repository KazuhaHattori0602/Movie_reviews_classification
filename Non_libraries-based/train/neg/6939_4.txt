r balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by ram gopal verma in nishabd in a sensuous way  this time it is mixed with mature humors   amitabh bachchan is a chef and owns an indian cuisine in london  he is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job  according to him  cooking is an art  still cannot make hyderabadi biryani properly   enter tabu who sends her the proper hyderabadi biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other
 amitabh is   and tabu is  
  no probs  but one hitch  tabu s father paresh rawal  the couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage  but amitabh realizes that tabu s father is much younger to him  and the complications begin
 performance wise all three actors are brilliant  the script of the film is very tight and interesting  the dialogues of the film are catchy  but somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled  the comedy is sometimes not properly understood  the film also tries to go lengthy at some parts   musically nothing much to sing about except the title track  the camera work is good  director r balki could have given much better from this script  but in the second half he himself looks confused  the  satyagrah  scene of the father looked irritating  but the lines spoken by amitabh bachchan during that scene are clap worthy   on the whole  cheeni kum needed to have more sugar
