power rangers  the completely awful kid s show from the  s still continues to disturb young children with it s complete cheesiness  and awful settings   this show was not entertainment  it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences   the toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such   i have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was   as such  it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made
