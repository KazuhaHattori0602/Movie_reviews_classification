you have to understand  when wargames was released in   it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers  the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions  let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling  real computers were beginning to show up in people s homes  and for the first time  society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie s premise excitingly prescient  granted  a talking computer that balanced it s free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched  but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it  i ve probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on   fast forward   years  and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a  sequel  called wargames  the dead code  i ll just dig right in  first of all  the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects  you re probably very confused right now  the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub game within the web site called  the dead code  where they pilot a plane over a city  spraying it with bioweapons  at some point in the game  you have to choose between  sarin gas  and  anthrax  and if you choose  sarin  then you re automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated  in the movie  this actually happens  however  since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious  it obviously all makes sense   second  the avatar of the ai in this straight to dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop up ad esquire sound bite  play with me baby  because apparently in the future  advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess  and gets into porn   third  the motivation for these  hackers  is profit and women  as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie  for some reason  recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else  that may work for your average sitcom  but c mon  you don t learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair  playing sports  and shopping at the mall  folks  the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie  and then later there is the phrase   good hunting  will  i swear  they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr  damon  this will kid isn t bad  but he was certainly wasn t like any obsessive hacker i ve ever met  i can t fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original  because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except
 professor falken and joshua  wopr  make a reappearance in this movie  as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom  and a dilapidated old tic tac toe machine with a higher pitched voice  after some prodding  joshua  the ai  has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice  a bunch of board games flash on the big screens  and the whole  the only way to win  is not to play  revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment  except that those of us who saw the original  you know  those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that  a recycled ending for a movie made from last month s compost   the new movie was directed by a guy who s done   and written by guys who do b movies  the original was directed by a guy who s been keeping himself busy with  heroes  so you see the quality difference there  there was talk of a real remake  but i hope they don t destroy this classic all over again  i swear  if i have to  i ll visit every gambling web site until i find the one that s run by a psychotic government computer  the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix  so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing  clicking  and indigestion
