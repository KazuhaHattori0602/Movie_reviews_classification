i ve given up trying to figure out what version of this i m watching  the copyright at the end indicates   and though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film  i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age  including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons  but with a  s synth soundtrack is unsettling  extremely unsettling   my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute as a button pamela franklin alive  how dare they   seriously she s all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i ve seen her in   this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house   they kill her off   i would like to put the film industry on notice  pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside   no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it  i am quite cross  the fury has been unleashed   for b movie fans seeking out a crapfest  you could do much worse than this  on the plus side  this is not a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way   this movie is a hardcore satanic film   wall to wall satanic ceremonies  baphomets  hallucinations  a ludicrous rat attack   what else could you ask for   this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted on  s synth soundtrack  which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be  the soundtrack reminded me of something you d hear on the equalizer  it s really bad   also  they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent  which was also quite rude  if not a cruel atrocity  against the viewer  such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights  i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice  who s with me  i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn t abuse pamela franklin  and so i throw the gauntlet down  sirs   anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with me   even in a fictional context   good day  sirs
