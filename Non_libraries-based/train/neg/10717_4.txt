i give this a generous four out of ten stars  or dots or markers  or something   there were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie  all the scenes with amy p and tina fey and greg kinnear  greg kinnear  moved along agreeably enough   otherwise  the usual trafficking in stereotypes  blazing speed  rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack  and  soundtrack  is generous    anyway  the two really really funny scenes involved amy p  she s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way  she s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on snl and lucille ball   i hope they  amy p and tina fey  just flat out admitted they did this for the money  because if by doing it  it gave birth to the sarah palin parodies  then i guess we can say  yeah  it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role  who s really there to help you be more human   blah    outta   like i said is generous   but no more  girls  ok  oh  i almost forgot  the mom from  two and a half men  is in this movie  and she s had some kind of plastic surgery  so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a   year old  so every scene she s in  i m like trying to rearrange her face  or put it together in my mind  or just answer the question   no  wait  wait  has she had plastic surgery  because as a viewer  you really don t want her to have had plastic surgery
