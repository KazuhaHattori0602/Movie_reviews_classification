like last year  i didn t manage to sit through the whole thing  okay  so chris rock as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging  or rather  out of all the total bores packed into the theatre  he at least wasn t in the top   most boring  a lot of the presenters  on the other hand  were in this coveted top   i hadn t known that the whole thing had been done by autocue  although i knew it was scripted  but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression  look away from the cue and stumble over simple words  natalie portman
if there s no director  she s gone  the night of fancy dresses and boring speeches was long and tedious  beyonce knowles butchered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance speeches and clips  adam sandler wins the worst presenter award   for helping me write this review i d like to thank my mum  my dad  my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me  and i d like to point out that i have a high metabolism and of course i haven t been starving myself for a month  i m not going to cry thank you
