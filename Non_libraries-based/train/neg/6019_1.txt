this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of   the acting is awful  even what some here have lauded  the carpathia character  the script looks like it was written in haste  in one scene  the black preacher who was left behind  when asked by buck what  dan  in the computer graphic meant  said   daniel    chapter    he probably meant verse   but the film makers missed this slip up  perhaps the worst part is that the film s eschatological position is biblically unsound  while many christians have espoused the film s interpretation of end time events  such interpretation  in  my opinion  is faulty  to understand these flaws  read  christians will go through the tribulation  by jim mckeever and  the blessed hope  a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture  by george e  ladd
