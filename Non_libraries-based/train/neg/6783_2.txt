there seems to be a surprisingly high number of   star reviews here from people who have never written an imdb review before or since  given the very low average rating given to the film by other people  i think you may draw your own conclusions   this is a very bad film  i ll admit it  i thought the concept was kind of cute  and i was pleased to see the actresses who played eve and harmony on angel getting work  but it didn t take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known   acting  the leads seemed competent enough  but everyone else  terrible   plot  chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through   direction  non existent   humour  did they really think people were going to laugh  oh boy   eye candy  ok  there were some really beautiful women in this film  not just the three main female characters  but right across the board  it was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn t notice how terrible everything else was  if so  they failed miserably   in the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic  it wasn t even close
