really it s a dreadful cheat of a film  its  minute running time is very well padded with stock footage  the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes  the plot exposition is very poorly rendered  they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together  there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors  please don t ask   the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth  it s a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour  nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much pass  by then   what saves this film  somewhat uniquely  is the stock footage  i ve never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film  this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see  there s a brief interception by a pilot flying  in alternate shots  an f  scorpion and an f  first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f  sabre jets  or canadian built cf s  and even a pair of cf  clunks   then for some reason there are b s  b s and even b s are seen taking off  more padding    these canadian jets are moving at   miles an hour  i don t think so since one of them appears to be a ww  era gloster meteor  the rest f s  the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f f with a flight of early straight wing f s attacking in formation   there s a strange tandem cockpit version of the f  that doesn t seem to be the t  training type but some sort of interim all weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose  these are scrambled in a snowstorm   an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about   meters  it launches f u crusaders  f f tigers  a  vigilantes and a  skywarriors  the air force scrambles f s and f s and more f s then you ve ever seen in your life as well as f  super sabres and f  delta daggers   the f s press their attack with sooooo much padding  the f s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo  the f s fire  an f  lets loose a falcon  even some f s  f s  with mid wing rocket pods let loose  there is a very strange shot of a late model f   prototype  with a straight wing early model f  above it in a turn  obviously a manufacturer s  republic aviation  advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f  thunderjet  how it strayed into here is anybodies guess   there is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york city s times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early  s    i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background  the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind boggling and there is a nice tr   to be seen also  canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background   as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture  and she most definitely is flipping someone off  could it be  r as in robert loggia  the director who dies before this film was released  her career as this was her last credit   its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift
