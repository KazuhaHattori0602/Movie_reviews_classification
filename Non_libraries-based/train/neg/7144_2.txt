it was almost worth sitting through this entire god awful  film  just to know that i can never experience anything as bad as this again  acting     script     fight scenes     male lead      cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl  nadia bjorlin      she is gorgeous and not a terrible actress  this is the criteria i used to average it out to a two  i lost count but i believe ever movie clich  ever  is in this movie  when the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her  from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement  plus he just shows up for no reason  he was never even mentioned before  i don t know what else to say here  just watch it when it comes out on tv in a couple years  at least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials
