it was   and it starred martin sheen   that alone says what to expect of this movie   and it was a movie  according to the movie  slovik had reformed  got a good woman  and didn t want to fight   in real life  slovik may have been a naive innocent  or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system   whoever slovik was or wasn t is for history to decide  but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting  and the movie took sides   with no regard to servicemen who were in viet nam either in    as willie nelson would say  let s tell the truth  it was about the viet nam war  not wwii  eoes was as propagandistic as gung ho was in the forties   according to this movie  slovik stated his position  plain and simple  he had a nervous problem  heck  i have a clinical nervous condition  and trust me  if i had done military duty  it would have been no problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on kp duty or latrine duty with no problem   if we believe the teleflick  slovik didn t have that option  no doubt because of his criminal history   whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer  i ve learned that movies from this decade or that decade  in dealing with service or military duty  will pretty much take the same stance over and over    s and  s  serve your country    s and  s  mock your country   this is the history   the whole movie seemed predictably hollywood to me  he refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion   such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition  but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful   i m not a catholic  but i thought the recital of the hail mary by ned beatty and sheen at the end  with the lord s prayer  was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster   i don t see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at tricky dick nixon and the viet nam war   i hope it was all worth it for slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example
