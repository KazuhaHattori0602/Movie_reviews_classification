that s what the title should be  anyway   this movie combines guns  explosives  and mindless killing to make one flop of an  action  movie  let me make my point in a series of questions  answers type deal   what happens in the movie  people die   is that it  yes   what is the plot about  what plot   what is the point the movie is trying to make  killing is the only solution   what are the characters like  extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities   is there anything good about this movie  yes  i m sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it   if you like constant killing and greed  then watch the movie  if you happen to be repulsed by such low standard  entertainment  then  made men  is not for you   to sum it up  the plotline stinks  the characters aren t worth their while  the storyline is completely resistable  and nothing fits together   this proves one thing  the actors  directors  and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren t  made
