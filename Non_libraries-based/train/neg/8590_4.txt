ludicrous  angelic  year old annakin turns into whiny brat  year old annakin  who somehow seems appealing to amidala    years his senior  now  year old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams  and so takes to slaughtering children  his friends  and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a  his precious wife might really die  and b  only he can prevent this  ludicrosity squared   i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention  the story is ridiculous  the characters are unbelievable  literally  not the perverted sense of  fantastic   wonderful  etc   obi wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series  but in the climax  he hacks off annakin s legs  lets him burn in the lava  and leaves him to suffer  doesn t anyone think that s a little out of character  not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living  as it turns out   i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations  none of that here  the story could have been written by a   year old   oh yeah  the cgi is pretty cool
