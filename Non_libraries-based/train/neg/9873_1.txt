i watched it with my mom and we were like   what the hell  we didn t get it at all  i may have this wrong  but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman s father  that movie was terrible  this is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie  bad suspense movie   shakes cane at movie  i m never seeing it again  and i m a big fan of lifetime movies  too  they kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books  it s driving me crazy   and whit was butt ugly and yet  she loves him more than hugh  who was a tiny bit nicer looking   my rating
