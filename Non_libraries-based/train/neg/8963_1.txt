the killings in this movie isn t that bad  but for sure the movie is  it s even worse than that  it s not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your dvd player   not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the dvd store  not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it  horrible   it s beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie  it was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching  add to that the group pressure from my co watchers   the manuscript is awful  the directing even worse and the acting is plain despicable   i hope you don t see this as a spoiling your fun  i d rather see it as a fair warning  do not waste your time watching this garbage
