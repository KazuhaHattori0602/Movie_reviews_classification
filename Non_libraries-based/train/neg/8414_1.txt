yeah  pretty sure i saw this movie years ago when it was about the supremes   another recycled storyline glitzed up hollywood style  borrowing scripts from better making it in the music industry films   nothing original here   more make up  glammier costumes and choreography   more money for the questionably  talented  beyonce draw   if you like the throwback style  you should appreciate actual groups who struggled  without having digitized voices and a hollywood empire   beyonce s involvement makes this hypocritical garbage
