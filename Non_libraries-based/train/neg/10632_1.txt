there are so many incorrect statements in this so called  documentary  that i found myself shouting at the television   bart sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking dvd  but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims   he relies on either being inaccurate  not telling the full story  or the old favourite  government always lies to us  innuendos  and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims   what s more  his  exclusive  or  unreleased  footage is freely available over the internet from various sites   further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews  and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions   all of the claims made by mr sibrel about  inaccuracies   mistakes  or  whistleblowing  in the apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven   how do i get that  odd minutes of my life back
