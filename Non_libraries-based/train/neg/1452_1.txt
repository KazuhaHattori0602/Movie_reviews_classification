this   to   germany looks hardly like a post wwii czech capitol  oh sorry  it is the czech capitol and it is   how funny   this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past  r hm is a head higher than adolf and looks so damned good  g ring looks like   when he just is   and the  f hrer  always seems to look like   and the buildings  folks  even buildings have been young  sometimes  especially   were a lot of houses in germany nearly new  the wwi does not reach german cities  no crumbling plaster  then the reichstagsbuilding  there have never been urban canyons around this building  never  and this may sound to you all like a miracle  in the year   the greater berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines  some even with turntable ladders  but none with a hand pump   one last thing  what kind of playmobil castle was this at the final sequence  for me this was a kind of  adolf s adventures in wonderland
