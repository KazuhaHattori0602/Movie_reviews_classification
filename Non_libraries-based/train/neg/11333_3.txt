this movie is just crap  even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture  it s still a very  very bad directorial debut  the topic itself is very interesting and i accept the bad acting due to the fact  that they are all amateurs and never acted before  but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing  there s no timing at all in that movie  i felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie  it s their first feature  that they actually never really asked themselves  what story they wanna tell  i met ben  one of the directors  on several occasions and he s a nice and thoughtful guy  but that doesn t make him a director  i think  that  american history x  is full of clich s  but somehow manages to transport a story   oi warning  is full of clich s  doesn t tell anything new or provocative and  that s the sad thing about this movie  it s far from any oi reality   if you wanna see weird but great german films  watch the movies of michael haneke  christoph schlingensief  oskar roehler  hans weingartner or oliver hirschbiegel   benny s video funny games die unber hrbare mein letzter film das experiment das weisse rauschen muxm uschenstill      out of ten  because of the topic and the photography
