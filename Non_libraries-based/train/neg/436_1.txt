if you ve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says   jesus is the answer  what s the question  then perhaps you should thank god if you ve never met a lacanian  slavoj zizek  the most evangelical of lacanians  would surely exchange the word  jesus  in that statement for  lacan hegel   zizek s star burns brightly at the moment  no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption  so it seems impressive when someone   anyone   comes along and says   hang on  films may say something about ourselves   the ideas zizek expounds in this film are  true  purely because he says so  for example  zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego  superego and id  god knows what happened to zeppo  or gummo 
 perhaps they re the sinthome or is that movies themselves  this is simply what they are  in zizek s output  culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology  people may object that he certainly has something to say   but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god s will   what s wrong with taking examples  from films or anywhere  to illustrate theory  well  nothing at all  as zizek seems to believe  they may even serve as a proof  however  it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context  without context  you can say and prove anything you want  for zizek  lacan is the answer   so he goes and makes an example of it  everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out  to serve this ideology  for instance  zizek s exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop  but  in the context of the film  this is not a voyeur s fantasy position at all  stewart has been deliberately led there by novak  this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek s two hour and a half cinematic sermon   his analysis of the  baby wants to f  scene in blue velvet is laughable  touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific  to the masculine  truth of  feminine jouissance  zizek says that isabella rossilini s character not only demands her degradation but is  unconsciously  in charge of the situation  this is an example of her  jouissance  well   possibly  but   sorry to be prosaic   where is the evidence for this  in the film  she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son  zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan  but this may be due to any number of things  isn t that the point of so called feminine  jouissance  according to lacan  feminine jouissance  unlike phallic jouissance  cannot be articulated  it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language  if this is right  then no example can be made of it  it also means that the entire concept is non sensical and entirely mystical  it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek   there s feminine jouissance for you  why is this feminine jouissance  because i say so    what example can really be garnered from these films  only zizek s psychology  why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films  even to the point that  when in a boat on botega bay  he says he wants to f  rod steiger too  is this not the wish fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films  as the saying goes  freud would have a field day with the pervert s guide to the cinema   but with zizek himself  nobody else   zizek s theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it  but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws  this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely   as to be almost useless   how the rest of us desire  for  as any psychoanalyst knows  how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated   and cannot be easily universalised  if at all  zizek s love of making everything an example of lacan s answer bears this out  how do we desire  like this  this is how i do it  problem is  in zizek s desire  everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire  but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don t like letting the  subject  speak for itself   the pervert s guide to the cinema is a summation zizek s love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political  what dogma isn t  zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis  what he is trying to discover  because the terms of his exploration  and therefore his ethics in doing so  are never put into question   zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing  he s a kind of henry ford of cultural theory  mass production and any colour as long as it s black  he is perfect for today s highly consumerist society  supposedly critical while giving people the same c ap over and over and pretending that it is something different  this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems   which capitalism always claims to provide   rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all  which is kind of like being brain dead  for me  zizek s third matrix pill is a suicide capsule   ps  i loved zizek s solemn remark   presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity   that music in films can greatly affect people s sympathies  did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws
