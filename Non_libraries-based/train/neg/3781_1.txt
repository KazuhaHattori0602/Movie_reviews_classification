 some possible spoilers    i m not too sure what dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk   million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick  they probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences  mostly families  to see it in droves  well it seemed to work for the opening weekend  it made   mil  roughly and has made   mil  total  an estimation for this weekend  but i think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing i did  when i saw and they spread the word  this is one majorly lame movie  apart from the animation everything else  mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old    the movie is only about   mins  long  but it feels like a three hour epic  a few sticking points for me are  well the irritating narration is one of them  and it s so obviously written  at one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared  up pops the narrator  the voice of the talented matt damon  to clear up any misconceptions  which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets    another one is the constant pop up of bryan adams songs  now i m a fan of his music  i think he s good  but come on did dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle   of his songs throughout such a short movie  i certainly couldn t  finally and here s a spoiler  a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary  no less  she  the horse  then falls into a raging river  spirit  the focus of the movie  tries to save her  but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a   foot drop  well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well  now i know this is a kids movie  but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable    to sum up  this is a really lame movie  i m not saying kids won t enjoy it  but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end  definitely on my top   worst list of this year    out of   stars
