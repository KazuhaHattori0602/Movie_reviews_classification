i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie    the   movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic  steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor  he has no passion in his play also the action in the original  getaway  was fantastic  but the remake has no action  it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in   was more difficult than in     i don t understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico  i think this is a mistake in the story   so i think that there was no need to remake it  or if they decided to remake a classic  they must choose an excellent actor for the first role  like johnny depp or brad pitt
