one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a  script existed that made any sense  was the rough cut   hours  long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives    why would anyone finance this mess  i will say that tom  wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can  with the dialogue and dramatic   situations he is given  but  characters come and go for no apparent reason  continuity is  non existent  and the acting  cinematography  and direction are  to  put it politely  amateurish  not one sleeps is an unfortunate  choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone  actually attempt to actually watch this film
