 sleeping with the enemy  is a predictable   been there before  thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try  i can t believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago   the complete lack of originality from the ronald bass screenplay  based upon the nancy price novel  does not help  nor does the stale direction of joseph ruben or the very average performance from julia roberts  the supporting cast including patrick bergin and kevin anderson do little to help   there really isn t a lot to say  just give it a miss   sunday  april       hoyts cinema centre melbourne
