i didnt think it was possible  but i have found film worse than  body melt  this film is really really bad  and what makes it worse is that its another australian film   shot on what looks like vhs  and with a terrible  s rock soundtrack  it just keep getting worse and worse  which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is  skinned male hanging up side down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone   and why do their accents keep changing  from bad new york drawl  to prissy english  then pure aussie  and it happens to the whole cast   this film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover  i believe it was the utah film festival  this has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would nominate this for anything  perhaps the golden rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell   come on guys  this film has to be number   on the bottom   it has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there   well done to the  film  makers of this trash  for proving there is a reason not to see films
