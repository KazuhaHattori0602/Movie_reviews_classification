i wasn t particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts   minutes  thank god  because i was falling asleep  i makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow  people  water  clouds  etc  unfortunately  that s all it is   my preference is for its predecessor  the excellent koyaanisqatsi made in   at   minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original  powaqqatsi made in   running   minutes   try them both
