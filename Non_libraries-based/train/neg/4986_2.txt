everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie  it shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie  my grandma could have done better than that  but that s not the only reason why this movie is really bad   it s actually so bad that i m not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark  if the first episode of  les visiteurs  was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues  this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one  the funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it  clavier is over acting his role even more than in the first part  robin is trying to act like lemercier  because she s replacing her  but that s  grotesque  lemercier is lemercier  robin is robin  even if muriel robin can be funny by herself on stage  she is not in this movie because she s not acting as she used to act  i know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role  lemercier obtained a c sar award for her role in the first movie  but she made a big mistake  instead of playing her role  she played  lemercier playing her role  as for the story  it s just too much  of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but poir  and clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode  the gags are repetitive  childish and d j vu  no  really  there s no more than   funny parts in this  the only good things might be the costumes and some special effects  so you have only   reasons to watch it    if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie    if you want to waste your time or if you really need a  brainless moment
