as long as there s been  d technology   s i think  there s been animation made for it  i remember specifically  a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it  i don t remember the name at the moment  but the plot was that donald worked at a circus  was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts  this was made to watch in  d probably  s  if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in  d in theaters  they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it s origin  there are probably somewhere around   cartoons made specifically to be viewed through  d glasses  this claim was a bad move because it s not difficult to prove them wrong  on top of that  this just looks like a bad movie
