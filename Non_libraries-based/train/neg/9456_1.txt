the sun was not shining  it was too wet to play  so i went to the movies  that cold  cold  wet date day    the cat in the hat  was the name of the flick  and when it was over  my stomach was sick   mike myers played the cat  his humor was lame  and kids needn t see this  the humor was not tame   the film was like drinking milk  from a rabid cow  so it is fun to have fun  yet the filmmakers didn t know how   this film  in short is atrocious  the acting was bad  the plot was tweaked too much  and the humor was surprisingly very crude   it starts with conrad and sally  a rule breaker and a future sheriff  when their mother has to go to work  she gets mrs  kwan to babysit  possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when mrs  kwan is watching a taiwanese court room  a `la c span  she soon falls asleep  and here comes the cat   the film starts to spiral out of control  the cat came to try to let the kids have some fun  he s got thing   and thing   who suddenly start trashing the house  he improvises a tv infomercial  and accidentally slices his tail off  and when the cat goes full carmen miranda  it s not funny  possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist  and there s a fish who tries warning the kids about the cat   too bad he didn t warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk  or chopping your tail off   soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog  who has the key to a crate on his collar  if the crate is not locked soon  their house will be home to the cat s universe  here it gets a little more interesting  but not enough to save the film   the acting  overall  is horrible  mike meyers brings his brand of irreverent austin powers humor to the cat  saying things like  you dirty ho  and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata  spencer breslin is great as the trouble making conrad  and dakota fanning is cute as sally  though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous aortic dissection waiting to kill john ritter accident waiting to happen  alec baldwin s slick and slimey lawrence quinn is disgusting  ever trying to woo the kids mom  who is played by kelly preston  and sean hayes is mr  humberfloob  mom s boss  and is also the voice of the fish  the latter three are also bland   overall  if i were a parent i would not take my kids who are into potty humor  cause there s plenty of it and more  save your   and see something else  as the late great dr  seuss once said   it is fun to have fun  but you have to know how  really  universal  stop  theodore s already turning over in his grave   like my mom always says   curiousity killed the cat  the cat in the hat   out of
