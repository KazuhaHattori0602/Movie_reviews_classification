i saw this movie in   i was   or   when it was released  the theater was perhaps   full when the movie started  ten minutes into the movie me and the friend who went with me to see the film were the only two people in the theater  the movie was really weird and had no plot or reason to its script and people demanded their money back  we decided to stay for the entire movie  why endure such torture  here s why  we wanted to be true movie critics  to have a standard to base all other movies on it is hard to justify saying you have seen the best movie  a  they always come up with something better  but  it is easy to be able to base all other movies off of the worst movie ever made  and this is it  a   at best  there may be other movies out there that truly qualify as a   but i have yet to see them  i now base all movies i see on a scale based on this worst i am a true movie critic he he
