this movie was a horrible excuse for a movie  first of all  the casting could have been better  katelyn the main character looked nothing like her tv mom    also  the plot was pathedic  it was extremely clich  and predictable  the ending was very disappointing and cheesy   but thats all i ll say about that    the nail in the bag though  was a scene when katelyn  jordan hinson  was supposed to be crying  but the girl couldn t cry on command  there were no tears streaming down her face  just a few unbelievable sobs  she is not a dynamic actress at all  she gave the same fake little laugh identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire  sp  thats when the movie went from not so good  to just plain bad  it really looked like she was acting    in a nutshell  this movie was really bad  it was kind of a mix of every clich  kid movie from the  s that everyone s sick of only worse   i give it an  f  because it was just so darn hard to sit through  b t w  i was babysitting when i saw it    however  you may like it if your   or under
