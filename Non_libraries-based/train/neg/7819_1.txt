 this would be the worst film i d ever seen  hmmm  ok maybe tied with boogeyman then  awful  truly awful   i had low expectations and it failed to meet them  i honestly cant think of one good thing  so here are the worst points     the acting   the plot   the cgi  xbox   has better graphics seriously    the plot   the dialogue and finally    the plot   there are so many unanswered questions  did they make a   hour long movie then realize they hadn t put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the   minute bit or did they actually think no one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman s son and the henchman he kills   was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it   when superman goes to hospital  why don t the doctors ask  what the f  do you want us to do  he s a f ing alien  we don t know jack about his anatomy    what happened in the   years superman was away to cause technology to advance   years    where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie   and finally  why  just  why    btw  for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite  i think i ve figured it out    since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks  it is clearly all in his head  therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock   either that or the writers are slack jawed half wits who didn t think that was a fairly obvious mistake
