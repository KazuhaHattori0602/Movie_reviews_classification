i gave timecop a perfect   i gave this    it s story is very boring  and it has only little to do with the original timecop  lots of things from timecop was scrapped  and they put in new stupid stuff instead  this story is taking place in    if i remember correctly  but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous  confused   and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about  well most of them aren t  only the first one is great  and there aren t many action scenes at all  and they re all pretty short  at one point in the story  the main character travels through time about   times within a few minutes  no wait  make that two times   in short  don t waste time watching this movie  it s not worth it
