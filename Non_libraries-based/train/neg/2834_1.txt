i ve now watched all four bo derek vehicles directed by her husband  john  all are quite terrible  of course  but this is certainly the pits  featuring the usual flimsy plot  bad scripting   by the director  naturally   and acting  not to mention gratuitous nudity by the star  it deals with her losing much older husband anthony quinn  she accepts his shotgun suicide by saying he had always admired hemingway  but who continues to appear and talk to her  in fact  he wants to come back in another  younger body
but actually does so only in the very last scene  derek is lovely as always  and still playing na ve    especially during a muddled mid section which has her pursued by a hired killer at a spa  quinn  too  is typically larger than life  read  hammy  here  but this easily constitutes his nadir  besides  for much of the duration  he acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic  presumably suggesting his being in some sort of limbo  his  replacement  then  is obviously a handsome looking stud who hasn t a lick of talent or even personality  also featured in the cast are hollywood veterans don murray  as quinn s best friend and bo s business consultant  and julie newmar  as quinn s guardian angel in the afterlife    plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire donald trump  who presumably needed this on his resume  it also goes without saying that john derek was his own cinematographer on the film  that the end credits are filled with useless  and corny  expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand  and that ghosts can t do it swept the board at the   razzie awards
