the first matrix movie was lush with incredible character development  witty dialog  and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story  these elements   coupled by incredible special effects of the day   presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time  enter matrix reloaded  and its sequel  revolutions  the problem here isn t the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue  the brothers have taken well developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs 
 the connection that was first established between viewers and on screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first matrix movie   to wit  morpheus was developed as a charismatic  philosophical character with insight far exceeding anyone else in the movie  but here in reloaded   we re presented by a different morpheus who stands hard and hollow  reduced to corny one liners that contradict the character we saw develop in the first film  this character just didn t feel the same  and this could also be said about the supporting characters in the movie   the removal of  tank  was also a disappointment  tank s involvement in the first film was minimal at best  but he played the role extremely well  in reloaded  we discover that tank dies after the events in the first film  and he is replaced by a jar jar binks stunt double that couldn t act to save his live  think stale box of kellogg s corn flakes  his performance left me chuckling throughout  and most of his spoken dialog lacked timing  there was an overwhelming sense that he was either trying too hard to convey his emotions on screen or the delivery in the script was off  in either case  the experience was humorous  at times i felt embarrassed for the actor   even neo s godly persona was suspect during most of the fighting sequences  the alleyway battle with the   agent smith clones was certainly exaggerated  one must wonder  for a man so gifted as neo   that he would even waste his time engaging in such a fruitless  frivolous battle when more pressing matters attend  especially when you consider his ability to fly or his ungodly ability to bend the matrix  certainly neo could have dispatched the clones much quicker  and more efficiently  again  such acts lend themselves to a script hindered by consistency  and scenes created as filler to keep us from feeling gypped  in jest  our expectations of the characters created in the first film are discarded promptly  sadly  for those expecting more of the same   you will certainly walk away feeling gravely disappointed   however  if you take reloaded as your standard  run of the mill action movie  and forget the incredible story inconsistencies and the untwining of already established character development from the first film  you should walk away feeling quite pleased
