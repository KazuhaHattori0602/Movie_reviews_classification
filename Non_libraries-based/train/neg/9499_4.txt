i thought the movie was a poor documentary  nothing of substance was discussed  it seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new  the film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science  most scientists appeared  stereotyped  and sometimes weird  a woman said that her awards didn t matter a whole lot  only children that were helped  she said that after a   minute scene where she explained all her awards  playing  humble scientist  are we   i have equations dancing in my head  another said  i don t see how that explains anything to us  it hasn t covered significant effects of science on our culture  politics of science were barely touched   not a bad flick for a   year olds  other than that  i felt it was boring and unrevealing
