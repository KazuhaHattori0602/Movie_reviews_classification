be warned  neither zeta jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe  their roles are in fact minor   the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama  with neither being really engaging  especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist  not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc  the plot drags terribly  and i turned this one off after about     unusual for me  as i like to finish what i start  the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from   to   stars
