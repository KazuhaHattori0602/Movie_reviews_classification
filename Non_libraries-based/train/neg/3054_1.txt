the nsa  cia  fbi  fsb and all other snoop agency in the world should watch this movie to gain information as to how to spy on people   as mst k commentary states it sanata has the dirt on every  santa s tentacles reach far and wide  there is no hiding from the klaus organization   from telescopes that can spy over millions of miles to ears that can hear everything  its amazing that the cia doesn t have santa on the payroll    satan s dance routine is hilarious  pitch he is so useless   the cheese factor in of this movie is tremendous  very low budget but so fun to watch  i recommend watching the mystery science theatre   version for even more laughs   you even get a laugh at the missfortune of the good kids   i give this a   for production quality and a   for pure cheese and fun factor
