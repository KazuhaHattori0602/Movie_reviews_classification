i know i ve already added a comment but i just wanted to clarify something   i m not some old fogey from the baby boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b w picture of phil silvers  jackie gleason etc   bilko was already   years old before i was born but i had the pleasure of discovering phil silver s bilko courtesy of bbc  i wonder if i would have enjoyed steve martin s travesty if i hadn t seen or heard of phil silvers   i don t know   maybe i would have   some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a   admit that they haven t seen the original  i can only urge you to spend   minutes of your life watching a single episode  if after watching the original ernie  colonel hall  ritzig   emma  duane doberman  henshaw  dino  flashman  zimmerman  mullin et al you still think that steve martin s film is woth anything above a     i ll stand you a pint
