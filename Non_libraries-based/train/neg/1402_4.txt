dynasty revisited in hawaii  full of clich s  highly predictable  unrealistic and sometimes even stupid  if you have nothing better to do however  it does provide   minutes of simple  unpretensive entertainment  endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular hawaiian scenery  on the other hand  if you are looking for anything more than that  stay away   oh  and by the way  if you have ever worked in a hotel or know anything about running one  you have two options    you will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents hotel business or    look at it as science fiction comedy as i did  lie back  relax  and laugh about it
