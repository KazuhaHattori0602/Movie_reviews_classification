the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german  post war movies  it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet  however  the makers of this series stuffed it with clich s  it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie  which is a direct copy of the cover of  pearl harbor   luise kielberg  bettina zimmermann  gets to hear that her husband  who is a doctor   ulrich noethen  has died in russia and after the war she s struggling to survive  she finds a job at the american base  gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer  heino ferch  in town  falls in love with  m  gets pregnant  and all of a sudden her husband turns up again  come on  we ve seen this once too often  heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well  bettina zimmermann however never really seems to convince  for some reason it always seems she s somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes  it just didn t work for me   the action scenes with the planes and the air lift  we re sometimes exciting  more often not  nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot   unless you re a big fan of wwii movies  i suggest you spend your money on something else  chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction     out
