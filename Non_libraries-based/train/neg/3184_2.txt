i ve never been impressed by jd anyway  and final justice  which i hadn t seen prior to its mst k airing  proves to be no exception  it s not that the character is any less likeable than mitchell  it s just that there s less that geronimo  call me  heronimo  to dislike   in fact  one suspects that mitchell and final justice were all schemes of a revenge seeking agent of joe don s trying to get the  star  killed by inducing a heart attack   joe don must have found a new agent  since he s now graduated to  comic relief  in james bond movies  the problem is  it s hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there  and his  serious  characters in his action movies like this one   as for the plot umm  what plot  they repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you ll think you were watching groundhog s day   presumably  the fact they keep using the same scene of geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort  ummm  yeah  whatever   on the plus side  the malta scenery is pretty gorgeous  so that kicked it up to a   for me  one suspects this flick set maltese tourism back a couple of decades  though
