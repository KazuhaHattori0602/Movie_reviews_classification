i just rented this movie to see dolph lundgren  whom i hadn t seen in any movies since rocky iv  unfortunately this movie was a big disappointment  the acting of all the parties was bad except for mr  lundgren  who was okay ish  kata dob  was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous outfit and make up   the plot is not at all clever  it s something that s been repeated a million times in different movies  the crooks were utterly stereotypical  and lundgren s character hadn t any depth in it  i didn t really expect a movie masterpiece  but unfortunately this is not even decent action  every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the unbelievable amount of over the top unrealism and comic book like characters started to annoy me strongly pretty soon   i would recommend this to young kids wanting some comic like action  but only if nothing else is available      i guess the current average vote of   with   votes must have been influenced by somebody involved in making this movie
