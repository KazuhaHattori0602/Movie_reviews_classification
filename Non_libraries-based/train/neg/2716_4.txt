is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television  or the media in general  as the  s  no  and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time  not really  but if we must have one  does it have to be as shallow as  the  s    i like to think that co writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted  especially given couturie s involvement in the superb hbo movie  dear america  letters home from vietnam  which utilized little original music and no original footage  letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves  this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production  but it doesn t do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time  like so many of its ilk  it s seen from the point of view of one family  but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the  s  it s amazing that one of them doesn t go to the rolling stones gig at altamont  making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade   the makers rush through it so much that there s little or no time to give the characters any character  with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time   the children s father is especially clich d   and then when they re back on blammo  it s something else  garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly  in fairness  jerry o connell  jordana brewster  jeremy sisto  julia stiles and charles s  dutton give their material the old college try  but they re wasted  especially the latter two  it s undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton  and rosanna arquette  in an uncredited cameo in part   is always welcome   what isn t welcome is how  the  s  drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect  and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post s america never mentions the british invasion   no beatles  no rolling stones  then again  there s only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album  right  capping its surface skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending   american dreams  and  the wonder years  did it all much  much better  nothing to see here you can t see elsewhere  people  except for julia stiles doing the twist  that is
