i watched the movie  and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience  the language would put to shame the street loafers   the plot  a father forcing none of his son to marry  seems far fetched    the idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded s attention    and i was waiting the whole movie for a laugh  and laugh i did on my stupidity to waste   hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look   hope it saves your time
