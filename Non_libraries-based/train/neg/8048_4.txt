suppose you ve been on a deserted island the last ten years  haven t heard of scream and left when halloween part   entered the cinema  then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene   at the moment  a   rating is on imdb and it doesn t deserve a that low appreciation  slashing all the way  like  i know what you did  and a who is it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who and why   no big surprise  just a nice flick to watch with a cola  popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot  deep characters  if the video rental is out of the top titles  you can take it without a risk  but don t expect a masterwork  i ve seen a lot worse
