i heard many stories about this film being great  well  i took my chance when i saw it for a cheap price at ebay last month   i watched it  and i have only a few comments about it     terrible story line    terrible acting    bad fighting scenes   i never seen any worse movie in my life so far  when the storyline is bad  than at least make the fights something more interesting  but both are done ridiculously bad     the only positive thing about this movie  in my opinion  is nikki berwick  god  she looks nice in this movie   that s about it
