after watergate  vietnam and the dark days of the nixon and jimmy carter eras  what the world needed was a good old fashioned chapter play hero taking on venomous serpents and evildoers in the america of   or the jungles of south america in a series of fantastic cliffhanging adventures  unfortunately what it got in   was doc savage  the man of bronze  perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george pal s final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth robeson s pulp paperback novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other  we can do better than that  and adding a bullwhip  a battered fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix   a big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman   explorer  adventurer  philanthropist  a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach blonde bulletproof muscle bound body of a greek god  or rather the form of tv s tarzan  ron ely  a rather dull charlton heston clone here  there s simply nothing he can t do and  more damagingly  nothing that can harm him  the man is the virtual incarnation of hitler s aryan ubermensch  no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany  albeit with all american values  and just in case there should ever be anything he s overlooked  not that there ever is  he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage  the  less than  fabulous five  a chemist  an electrician and even an archaeologist i can accept  and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer  but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures  in reality doc s brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way   even kryptonite wouldn t put a dent in him   there needed to be someone at risk in the stories  though with the exception of paul gleason they re all so horribly badly cast and overplayed  as are most parts in the film  you d happily kill them all off during the opening titles  the villains fare no better  with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas  scott walker  no  a different one  delivering one of cinema s worst accents  is it meant to be scottish  irish  welsh  greek  pakistani or some nationality no one has ever heard of  while robyn hilton s marilyn monroe ish dumb blonde moll gives paris  no relation  a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes   even with those drawbacks  this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients   lost tribes  a pool of gold  a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive  all wrapped up in a quest to discover why doc s father was murdered  unfortunately it s a question of tone  in the  s and  s pulp superheroes weren t brooding figures prone to state of the art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought  the films aimed purely at the matin e market  you know  for kids  there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight faced   and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post production  be it the colgate twinkle in doc s eye  the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust up with captain seas or don black s gung ho lyrics to john philip sousa s patriotic marches   but plenty was in the film to begin with  after all  it s hard to see how one of the villain s underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat  while doc s explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam west s batman  instead  the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional  such as doc displaying his sixth sense by  er  bobbing his adam s apple   perhaps an even bigger problem is that  while promising on paper  the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion  be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys  even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson  having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier  doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them   still  aside from doc s various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze  the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously l a  standing in for new york while fred koenekamp s cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget  and it s good to see a superhero movie that doesn t spend most of its running time on an origin story  though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himself   it s a film i d really like to like more  but it just feels like   minutes of lost opportunities  no wonder doc savage  the arch enemy of evil  the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits  never happened
