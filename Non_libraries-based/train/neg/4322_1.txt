 pletely and absolutely fails  i ve been trying to think of one good thing about it and can t  let me mention some of the highlights    people don t die  they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in santa s factory  angels are actually ex cowboys who sit in trees  santa can bring people back from the dead  if you send him a nice letter    and the plot  i won t spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn t any  even the photography is bleak   snow shown at the end of a freeze  everywhere looking cold  damp and miserable    as you might guess  the film has a happy  schmaltzy  ending  what a relief
