the plot was very thin  although the idea of naked  sexy  man eating sirens is a good one   the film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie splatter lesbian mouth licking shots in between   the characters were wooden and one dimensional   the ending made no sense   considering it had tom savini and shaun hutson in it  you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects  some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them   brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush  naturally  and of course the lesbian moments  i also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the  shower scene   the film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely   if i had been watching this alone and aged   i would have really enjoyed it for about   minutes  with   hand of the remote control  then lost interest suddenly and needed a pizza
