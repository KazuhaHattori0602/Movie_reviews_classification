i can t say this is one of the best films i have ever seen  but then again  i can t say it s one of the worst i have ever seen   ok  so it s basically a girl does skating  is good at it  wants to go to an expensive school  can t afford it and has to take a hockey scholarship  she has to hide her skating secret from her friends   personally  i didn t like the actress playing katelin  she absolutely couldn t cry to save her life  just made wailing sounds  like a toddler pretending to cry to get it s own way   katelin was just an annoying person  the way she tried to act all nice and helpful to people  also the part where the two skaters are calling her names and they say something about her choreographer and she says she  draws the line  made me cringe   we all knew where it was going to go with her and spencer  classically they didn t like each other and sort of get together at the end was just typical   overall  i think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don t mind the main skater being extremely annoying  it s good to kill time basically
