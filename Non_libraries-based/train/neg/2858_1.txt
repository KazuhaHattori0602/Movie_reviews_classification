this has to be one of the worst movies of all time  the graphics were horrendous  the acting was b movie and the effects were just plain nintendo   qualified  you would think that they would put a little more effort into it  of course  it is a scifi channel movie so you have to expect it to be low rate  but this one takes the cake  hell  i m still laughing  so  as a shake your head in disbelief movie  this one does well    although it appears to have some  known  actors and actresses in this  it is difficult for me to believe that they did not realize that the quality of this movie was worth their time and effort    the graphics might have been good in the  s or even early  s but come on  this is   i wont give spoilers out  let s just say that if you have played  jurassic park  on the nintendo   you will be very familiar with what you see in this film  it is definitely not worth the   hours it took to sit through the thing
