this is not a very good movie  but it s not a stinker either  it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk   my gf and i have figured this movie out  we think  so here it is    major spoilers below   firstly  this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious dream state junk   of the movie   ignoring the junk  what really happened is this  a group of school friends go to a rave one night  they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die  that s the simple cut down version   that s right  i said sean  bear with me   right after the accident  cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life   death right up until the very end of the movie  this is where the dream part starts   the movie is called soul survivors  right  cassie s mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls  annie  matt  raven  the   weirdos and jude  along with images conjured up by her mind  sean  school and everything else around her  the souls continue doing what they were defined as  annie the rave going chick  the   weirdo killers  from opening scene  father jude still helping people etc   we are then taken on a very long ride  shown lots of images  many of which my gf and i still can t tie in  but it all boils down to it not being cassie s time to die   at the end  cassie wakes up in the hospital after being  dead  for a while  her family and sean are there  this is reality again  she s ok   then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled  but this part is really just a nightmare  and she wakes up beside sean  obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience   due to space restrictions  we didn t cover every little thing  but feel free to drop us an e mail if you want to
