spoiler alert   although i think this one was spoiled coming out of the can
 it s hard to even imagine that a film with these stars  from this studio  made at this time period  could be so awful  but it is  it is the film s biggest flaw by far that it just doesn t make any damn sense   rich widower american aristocrat penn gaylord leaves his small daughter  in charge  and goes off to world war i where he is killed  then we flash forward to present day   and total confusion  the three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years  and some jerk named barclay is trying to take their home away from them  this is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script  more holes in it than the warren report  what happened to the gaylord fortune  if the will is worth half a billion  why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on the munsters  who the devil is this barclay clown  and why is he able to take someone s home away from them  the questions just pile on top of more questions   the usually affable and charming george brent is playing barclay  who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone  taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt  yet no one besides fiona  barbara stanwick  seems to particularly dislike this cretin  why  none of these questions are ever answered  we instead just follow fiona s life from one train wreck to another  the evil barclay takes away her home  her fortune  and even her child  what does she do  shoot him  set him on fire  no  too logical  in a completely improbably wrap up  this woman  who s only prior romantic involvement with barclay was  save for the technicality of marriage  rape  suddenly decides mid sentence  literally  that she does not hate him  she loves him  and they re going to live happily ever after  all of a sudden for no reason in the world  this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era  yeah  sure  steal everything in the world that belongs to me and i ll fall in love with you  on what planet does that happen  i can only guess the reason i never heard of this film before i happened to catch it on turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today
