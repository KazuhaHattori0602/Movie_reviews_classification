if you hit your teens in the  s  as i did  you probably remember the stories about studio   whether or not you liked disco  an exclusive club  it was the perfect symbol of  s cultural overindulgence and self absorption  there s even an excellent vh  documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday  and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film   sadly  this isn t it    follows the lives of a few of its employees  a bartender named shane  ryan phillippe  a busboy named greg  breckin meyer  his wife  a coat check girl  anita  selma hayek  and of course the master of ceremonies himself  steve rubell  mike meyers  while the goings on at the club are well represented  this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers  following shane s story the closest   the movie works in spurts  sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture  such as when shane is taken to a dinner party and doesn t know who  errol flynt  is  and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama  some of that is inherent in the premise   following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous   but a lot of it is due to the kid gloved treatment with which both the club and rubell are given throughout the movie  while rubell certainly electrified the scene in new york with his penchant for over the top spectacle and his exclusive hand picking of the crowds each night  the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on  and rubell himself  while his excesses are mentioned  come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar  a cheat  a drug abuser  and promiscuous as all hell  not that i was looking for the man to be pilloried here  but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate  a final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd   meyers does his best to capture rubell  but he s given so little to work with here it s surprising his performance is effective  but he s good  and he helps to anchor the film  philippe  whom i find generally to be a good actor  is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character  he s limited to a deer in the headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown  and even he can t translate that into a strong performance  hayek and meyer are both okay  again  undercut by the writing  and neve campbell   prominently featured on the dvd cover   appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo   for some reason i still find myself interested  even fascinated  by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies  but even given that  this is not a film that particularly engaged me  despite a predisposition to like it  i d say if that era  or that club  has any interest for you  track down the vh  special rather than this middle of the road melodrama
