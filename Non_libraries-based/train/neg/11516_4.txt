for years madonna has tried to prove not only herself  but the public eye  that she can act  unfortunately  trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn t mix well   she seems to fare better when she s not the star of any movie  if you watch her in supporting performances in desperately seeking susan   or a league of their own   she actually comes off looking good  since the story revolves on other actors  the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default   the trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie  regardless the genre  being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way  whether it be good  mediocre or plain awful  she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance  this is the crucial difference between madonna and  let s say  bette davis  or meryl streep  the latter two  even if the movie were to fail  because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it  or because the script fell short  or because the actress per se was just not at her moment  there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb  both davis and streep have had their share  bette  having a longer career than streep  in such fare as bunny o hare   and wicked stepmother   streep in she devil   but at least there s been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance   madonna  on the other hand  not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself  fares much worse  and even in the hands of someone as woody allen in shadows and fog   an inferior classic  she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff  maybe even nervous  as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn t let go   so here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two character movie  guy ritchie  more known for action movies filled in masculine energy  seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of michaelangelo antonioni or ingmar bergman  who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease  and at   minutes  the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn  it doesn t feel sincere  from being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love  this has to be the most unconvincing   degree turn since fay dunaway s laura suddenly discovered her passion for tommy lee jones in the eyes of laura mars   equally unconvincing is adriano giannini s nasty turn around the middle of the movie   it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic   and when he gives in to madonna s love  it s too quick to be believed  filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn t enhance or add upon this  transformation  from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other   trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well   it only makes it drag  bog it down  and when madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close up  it feels she s trying too hard  many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little  hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late  s  early  s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion   could the movie have been better  of course  there are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again   it s been done before  in overboard   for example  it could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change  to ensure a moral tone  much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more  silent  film look   as in persona   it could have even been something of a thriller  providing that the giannini character have a mean streak as billy zane had in dead calm   even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for madonna as the over the top  uber control freak getting her comeuppance  but with its mean streaked humor  without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom  and without really defining giannini s own character  this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes
