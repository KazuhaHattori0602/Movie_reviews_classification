do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation  technically  i am a boomer  though at the time when all the  idealistic youths  of the  s were reading marx  burning their draft cards  and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives  i was still in grade school  but i remember them well  and   out of   were just moronic fools  who would believe anything as long as it was destructive   this is just another excercise in self importance from the kids who never really grew up
