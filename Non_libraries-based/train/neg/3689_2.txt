the main aspect about the superstar s movies at his later stages were the frequency  the lacuna between one movie and the next  being a well established star of the south indian cinema  the feedbacks he was receiving before baba was great    since nattukku oru nallavan   the number of movies he acted in tamil as a mass hero in   years were only   exactly at the rate of   per year  all of these were a great hit  he was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down    but after padayappa   he went into a state of hibernation  his fans all over the world  especially in south india were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action  so  the tamil cinema industry decided to come with baba    the movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with superstar in it  but this clearly did not work out in this movie  as usual  the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit    rajinikanth s image was totally damaged  the fans went nuts  the movie s collection did not meet the expected level  reputation of great people went down    the only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by a r rehman  rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like tajmahal  kadal virus  alli arjuna  paarthale paravasam  star  en swasa katre  vandicholai chinnarasu etc  well  i never thought that this movie would join that league   you l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad  it l be because of the superstar s image going down  it took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies chandramukhi and sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film
