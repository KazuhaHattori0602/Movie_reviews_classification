this movie sucks from beginning till  especially  the end  you probably don t get  m any worse  acting  storyline  photography  camera work  etcetera it s all bad  very  very bad   but that s what makes it a  great  watch  it will give you more than enough good laughs  the worse  the better    i really have no clue what so ever of what these people were thinking making this movie  a serious viking movie  the story is goddamn ridiculous  it s more like a comedy in disguise  kinda like mafia  also pointless but damn funny   and look out for the very very end of the movie  uhum
