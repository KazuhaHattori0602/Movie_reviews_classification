this film is massively boring and pretentious  there is only one good moment when a sailor shaves mr barney s think the purple dinosaur less pretense  eyebrow  the music is relentlessly cloying it is sad that bjork  someone with so much inner beauty  has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art  the pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid  the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted  not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker stay tuned  in a perfect  art imitates life  moment the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh t  which is what the audience found in the theatre  there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart then
prepare for spoilers i m talking to you mr barney   the emperor has no clothes  mr  barney you have been outted  i have seen jodorowsky s holy mountain  and your thin  fake veil of bs has been lifted  you have stolen your images your style and your entire art catalogue from this man  now that holy mountain has been released finally let s hope the powers that be at the art councils of the world stop financing you  poor jodorowsky lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon mccartney of film making  and btw while jodorowsky is the beatle you are the monkees  a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen  and btw i am a filmmaker  if you are interested in making a reality film i will legally fight you in a ring defending jodorowsky you  defending outright thievery
