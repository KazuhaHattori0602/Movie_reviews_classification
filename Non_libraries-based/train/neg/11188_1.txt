this really is the worst film i have ever seen  ever  period  i actually paid   to watch this steaming turd of a movie  incredibly dull  poorly acted  dire script  often incoherent and too many scenes that don t seem to have any relevance to the overall film  like when heath ledger s priest partner get s nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene  answers on a postcard please   i should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it s entire running time  i would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again   this should be cast into imdb s bottom   hopefully my vote of   will help it on it s way
