i really liked zb  really  i did  i have no problem with extremely low budget movies  and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb   if you can imagine such a thing  check out  wiseguys vs  zombies  if you re interested  indeed  i prefer lower budget zombie films  because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are  about   but zb  was just so bad  it was retarded  i don t want to bother being dignified in my criticism  i want my   minutes back  etc  except that it really only took   minutes  because partway through i put it into  x fast forward   okay  here s some criticism     the pacing was terrible  everyone talked in monologues  even when someone just had a single line  the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue  at first i was excited about the   minute running time compared to zb s   minutes  but there were actually fewer  events  in zb  it s all talking     the gore effects got stupider  just glop rubbed around on people s tummies     despite the epic exposition  there really wasn t a plot  and the exposition is indeed epic  i won t spoil it  if you re going to watch it   don t watch it  but then  it s just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for   minutes  or fewer  if you so choose
