despite being a huge fan of fred astaire and ginger rogers  movies  it wasn t until about   years ago that i first saw  follow the fleet  i knew all the songs from an old astaire rogers record  yes  vinyl  but knew nothing of the plot   unfortunately  while the songs are catchy and ginger rogers  character is sweet and funny  you just can t like  bake baker  while trying to make up to his longtime partner  he continually sabotages her career  his character doesn t have the usual humour and elan of the other films  astaire characters   worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by ginger rogers
