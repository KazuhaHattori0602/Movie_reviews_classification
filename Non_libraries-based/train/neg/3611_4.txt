colleges  high schools  fraternities and sororities have been the most popular stalking grounds for maniacal madmen since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies  even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category  from early entries like to all a good night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like urban legend or schools out  there s usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline  despite being picked up by troma   the titans of b movie badness   splatter university was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience  even notorious hack and slash websites like hysteria lives have written off richard haines  splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom  i always approach criticised movies optimistically because there s often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu  which crowds the judgement of certain authors   it begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges  yep you guessed it   an insane asylum  it seems that one of the inmates has decided that he s unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore he s looking to take his business elsewhere  the unseen nut job makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly doesn t shine  he obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker  so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform  blood stained trousers and all   three years later  we transfer to st trinians college  an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests  a teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden there s a knock at the door  before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants  he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap  this of course means that there s a vacancy at the university and so we re introduced to julie parker  francine forbes  the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer  it seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughter thon  before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade  suspicious suspects abound  but can professor parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic    i m not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available  the uk altered video was released under the alias of campus killings  but the us copy that i own states that it s the complete unedited edition  which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere  i d be fairly surprised if that was the case as splatter university certainly isn t as gore delicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe  one or two litres of corn syrup certainly don t stand up to gore hound s scrutiny when compared to the likes of blood rage or pieces  so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped  one thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from francine forbes  who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the  minute running time  despite amateurish direction from richard haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer  unfortunately that possibility never came  and bottom of the barrel bombs like death ring and splitz certainly didn t help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarship   the rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity  especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of grease or the wanderers  the bog standard point and shoot direction couldn t have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable  perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in haines  slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion  let s just say that it s not a final that i was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle   at one point in the runtime  one of the teens says   man that parker bores me to tears
  well the same can be said for splatter university  which never lifts the pace above slow motion  with that said though  francine forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that i would have paid to watch again in a similar role  so that pretty much sums up this un troma tising ride  slow paced  shoddy but still strangely alluring  you d have to be especially forgiving to give it a chance
