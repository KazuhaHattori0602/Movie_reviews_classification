a pretty average scifi film  the plot was more or less obvious from the start  although the acting was reasonably good  the writing seemed very cliched  using ideas taken from numerous films   the basic plot  scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting  onboard they find a stasis pod  which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment  after   or   minutes of the man in the pod waking up  you realise that he is a complete lunatic  something which totally escapes the   person crew of the research ship   after that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims  overall i think speed   was a better exploration of the subject matter  which i didn t consider to be a good film either   not a good film  get aliens out and watch that again
