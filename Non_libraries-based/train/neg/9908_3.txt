i gave this   stars out of a possible     because the stories are open ended and left unexplained  and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way  plus scenes of a decaying corpse    neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner   the film s plot  such as it is  concerns three loosely interconnecting stories  none of which conclude satisfactorily   the bounty hunter  played by bruce dern  is the character that connects all three vignettes   first we have dylan mcdermott  looking darn fine  as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter  when he rides through a border town and spots a sad faced saloon girl played by helen hunt   then we have one of the hemingway girls  not sure which one  playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman  an attractive redhead  whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long   the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him  with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension
