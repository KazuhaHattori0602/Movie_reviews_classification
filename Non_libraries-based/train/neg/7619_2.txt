as a mystery science theatre   fan  i can withstand any motion picture that can be foisted upon me  but there is absolutely no reason for this   rated  super action  in the blockbuster video section and given the dreaded  restricted viewing sticker  i m assuming these are the only methods that film maker  ha  robert napton could use to get at least   from one unsuspecting person   shame on you robert napton  shame on you for exploiting these poor mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in american cinema  you are a disgrace   there isn t one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action  did you use snot on these people  oh  look  they re having a rave in a field  like all   of them  and isn t that an asian guy in the background  why is it always daytime  why did it take   of the movie to show anything  and more importantly why did we watch the other    ps  you owe me
