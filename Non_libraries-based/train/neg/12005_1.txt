we all have seen some unending epics in our times  but this one really tops them all  the movie is so long and so slow  that  just to put things in perspective  i felt a lot older when i left movie hall  than i entered it  at almost   hours length  it could have rather been made into a tele serial   what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace  nikhil advani has woven the plot around   love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them  there is no interconnection between them to start with  and links shown in last   minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story   situation is made worse by silly dialogues  most of them repeated in hindi cinema over years and stupid cinematography   priyanka doesn t realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen  an utter waste of beauty without acting skills   and then there is loud is humorous govinda   my face twists better than jim carrey akshay khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers   only good part in movie is john   vidya s love story   nice acting comedy by sohail   isha  but they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters  their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines   my guess   director was making two separate movies may be more  and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records  beyond a point of sorting them out  so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie   watch it only if you want to test your patience
