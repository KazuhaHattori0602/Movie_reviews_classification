let me start off by saying i am not a fan of horror movies  i never watch them   let me tell you about my experience   the only reason i watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over happy feet    i never saw happy feet  but i am sure it is better than this movie  anyway  we didn t actually expect it to be good we actually went in just to laugh at it  cool with me i have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out  it did not matter   after   minutes the   other people left to go sneak into borat  a movie i would have gladly seen again over this  the movie was not scary  and not stupid so it would be funny it was just boring  it wasn t terrible like  baby genuises  terrible  it was terrible like not entertaining at all  avoid   now i am no expert  but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a pg  horror that is boring and not scary  or you can have an r gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people   you want a pg  horror that sucks but is funny  see  the grudge  avoid this movie like the plague because it may literally bore you to death
