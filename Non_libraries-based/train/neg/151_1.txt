this is really terrible   the only redeeming feature about this movie is that the next time people ask me what is the worst vampire movie i have ever watched  i would have a suitable reply   i think it is filmed on   mm so it is already tacky like hell  i wouldn t have bothered commenting but i noticed some fanboys  probably connected to the movie  had claimed that this was the best movie since the matrix  let me debunk the myths and lies   there is nothing good in the movie  everything yells tacky  the actress is ugly  the fight choreography is the worst i have ever seen  the fight scenes are unbelievably amateurish  imagine a girl flailing her arms around in a circle helplessly and delivering weak kicks which wouldn t hurt a kitten  obviously  the director just pulled people off the street to give them roles in the movie   i know the director did not have much budget for the movie but still better movies have been made on smaller budget before  unforgivable
