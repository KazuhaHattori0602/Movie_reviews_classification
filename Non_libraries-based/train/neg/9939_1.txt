the film school intellects can drool all they want about the important  imagined  meaning of this film  but it s just that  intellectual drool  this film is creatively bankrupt  and some mistake it s endless self indulgent wanking as substance  yeah    obviously godard wasn t a stones fan  too bad  because this could have been great  he s capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a true detective mag or some such crap    then there s the endless shots of what looks like  s librarians spray painting words on people s cars  and then there s the seemingly neverending  interview  where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions  there s some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book  which goes on for  oh  only about   minutes  and black panthers or something in a junkyard   it almost sounds intriguing  well  it s not   but for unwashed film school hipsters who don t care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the stones bringing sympathy for the devil into the world and would rather hear some english guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag s  this film s a real winner   more accurately maybe godard just blows
