hiya folks   well  this movie sucks really  think  love actually  in reverse  nothing fits quite right  nothing is coherent  and certainly nothing makes you laugh  love is rare in this film   it is a total flop  as indicated however  there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film   a  with a star billing of jennifer love hewitt  there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite hewitt with form fitting clothing  to tell you now guys there are some promising scenes but it s really weak eye candy  the  possibilities  here are watered down  nevertheless  i watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what titillating   b  the ending is romantic and positive  that it s contrary and  over the top  is relevant yet for me was still a positive point   c  dougray scott plays an amourous friendly guy refreshing  thank you      not worthy of your   or so dollars    s of the way through  i was convinced jennifer love hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend  although i ll take that back for now it hinges greatly on her next film   oh  and her sister is way stupid  her husband is way stupid and what the heck  she s way stupid   next time  can t wait for the next love actually with jlh
