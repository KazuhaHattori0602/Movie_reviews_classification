being that i loved the original  caligula  even with all its flaws  i have to say this remake trailer was abysmal   listening to jovovich say in that lazy american accent  mmm cuhligyooluh  makes me feel sick  the set doesn t look roman at all  it looks like some rich actor s hollywood mansion backyard  and the roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop   that  charming  adriana asti looks like a fifty year old hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind  as if not knowing it s a movie trailer   the acting has got to be some of the worst i ve ever seen  with most of the lines i hear being random actors screaming  caligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can   the random sex scenes also filled a good   or   of the trailer  and the scenes with notable actors actresses like gerard butler  who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds  not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all out over the top with their minimal lines  just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery   courtney love s part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something  you can t tell because she s either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically   karen black is just annoying  randomly laughing  and screaming in such a way that irritates you   helen mirren  she was in the original  and her return to  caligula  consists of   caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaligulaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  i particularly  love   and by love  i mean hate  ennia s line   caligola  j  no maki me  something incoherent   something that sounds like j nalo  it s also insanely arrogant to say caligula s four year reign was greater than jesus s birth and death   honestly  this has got to be the worst  most exploitative  self indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as  art  i ve ever seen  even if gore vidal hated the original caligula  he shouldn t have shown up or given his name over for this crap pile  no matter how much they paid him  unless it was a billion trillion yen  worst trailer ever
