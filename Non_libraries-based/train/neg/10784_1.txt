it was disgusting and painful  what a waste of a cast  i swear  the audience   full  laughed twice in   minutes  this is not a lie  do not even rent it   zeta jones was just too mean to be believable   cusack was ok  just ok  i felt sorry for him  the actor  in case people remember this mess   roberts was the same as she always is  charming and sweet  but with no purpose  the  romance  with john was completely unbelievable
