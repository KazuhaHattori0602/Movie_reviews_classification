gloria victor and dolores reed in space girl costumes   i love   sci fi  i even love cheesy  s sci fi  but this film is really  really bad  and not in a mst k kinda way   virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best  hip cat  impression of abott   costello   chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi  such as in  cat women on the moon  but it can t in this case  this film requires a mute button and fast forward feature   that said  i could watch gloria and dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
