my wife and i both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made  certainly in the top ten of those i ve watched all the way through  at least  plan   was enjoyable   i did really enjoy  christine   the dead zone   firestarter   carrie  and some of his other films  i didn t care much for  cujo   only because the sound was so bad on versions i ve seen and i often couldn t tell what people were saying  or  pet sematary  pet cemetery   but this mess was a total mistake in every way possible  the  creatures  themselves seemed designed by a  year old   no offense to  year olds   even the  one liners  made us groan and weren t remotely amusing
