mary lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in    well  the movie mainly takes place in   the movie falls into the  s trap of weird stupid special effects  including some weird demented looking rocking horse   anyway  mary lou s spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person s body  whether or not she succeeds  you ll have to watch to find out   anyway  the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters  this also isn t really a sequel  the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school  it has the avg  horror flick fall backs  gore  pointless nudity  knocks against the catholic church  basic stuff  boring movie   the acting is decent enough to give it a   out of   you can waste your time doing something else
