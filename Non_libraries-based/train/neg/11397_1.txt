this was truly dreadful  it had a terrible storyline  was poorly acted  and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good   it took all my tenacity to make it through this one  it s a good job i didn t have to visit the toilet else i doubt i would have come back  this one makes hammer house of horror look like a big screen hollywood epic    the only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women  not a bad one among them    if you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one s for you   else avoid it like the plague
