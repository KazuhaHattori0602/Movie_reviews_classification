the film had some likable aspects  perhaps too many for my taste  it felt as though the writer director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters  not once  a few times but all of the time    this is the job of television  not cinema    the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler s performance as the pregnant friend    i felt as though justine clarke s performance was wan  her reactions to things felt forced  as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist s expressions  i also can t believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence    i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences  this is a lazy device  especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest    that said  there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality  it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine  especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity  infusing it with passion and hand crafted charm    i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked   who knows if there s a god  like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do  or whatever the line was    perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife  i m giving up smoking    an anti smoking commercial  a tac ad with some tasteful animation  i had to leave the cinema at the   minute mark   it was all too much
