i won t describe the story  as that has been done elsewhere  we are great clive owen fans  and when our netflix recommended the movie  we were intrigued    no wonder we had never heard of this  movie  because it was a bbc television movie back in   hence  the poor production values  grainy image   jerky camera work and poor sound   but  you don t really mind the mechanics  because the story itself will put you to sleep  it s an interesting human story  but not at all compelling  and there is hardly any ending  you don t really care for the characters as their lives are as boring as your life watching this tedious movie  save the two hours and do something to make the time more worthwhile
