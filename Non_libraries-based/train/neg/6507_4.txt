you know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when     it was made it the  s   it s in black and white    it has no name actors    screaming makes up for the lack of special effects   well not to be outdone   this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder   okay   shhhhh but i am gonna discuss special effects here   or lack of them     did you catch the underwater scenes  it looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium   note the cape flapping in the breeze   and the repeated re use of stock footage   exterior house shots  the bridges scenes   great enhanced the k r a f tiness of this film   not since  plan     have i seen such creative usage of stock footage   and hey where there was a lack of special effects   not to worry   screaming does take the place of special effects in this movie as well  yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick   grab the popcorn   set your brain on stun  several fermented beverages definitely helps  sit back  and wonder  why the heck did they put this on film again   wayno
