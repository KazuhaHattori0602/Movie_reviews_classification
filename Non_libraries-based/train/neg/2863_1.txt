i was glad to watch this movie free of charge as i am working in the hotel industry and this movie came lately to our movie library  nothing against low budget movies  but this movie has horrible acting and directing  how can a movie as this one ever be made  the director should be blacklisted  and for all the poor actors  it is for sure not a jumping board into a career  please make sure that you ll not watch this movie  the acting is lame  the camera and directing awful  there are just a few more movies out there which deserve to be called the  low   another example would be  dracula   people who make money with this movie should give it to charity  so at least it serves for a good reason    in this case i would watch it even another    or at least one more time
