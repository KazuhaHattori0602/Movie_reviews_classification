unlike  the adventures of buckaroo banzai  or  big trouble in little china  or  conan the barbarian  which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations  the golden child is just plain bad   the premise itself is not unworkable  and there are some funny moments  but here the eddy murphy  flip attitude  just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story  and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension  the  mystic secrets  of tibetan buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel   without a feeling that anything is at stake  or that the characters are faced by real danger  why should we care   who should see this film     big fans of eddy murphy who can t help themselves    i can t think of anyone else  i ll give this film a   out of   for the occasional joke that worked
