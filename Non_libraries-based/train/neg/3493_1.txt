   but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible  just terrible  i like shaw bros  movies  i m not a hater  and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many   best kung fu martial arts movies  websites   i m now convinced that those   best lists are all cut and paste jobs  first of all  there s barely any action in the film  most of the movie consists of talking about the plot  which is an amazing feat because it s thin at best  and the action itself may have been impressive back in   but it s routine by today s standards  a special warning to netflix users  the dvd they ship is terrible  the picture is horrendous and it s not even   enhanced
