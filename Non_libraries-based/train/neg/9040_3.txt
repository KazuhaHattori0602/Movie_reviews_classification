i do agree that though this story by melville just might be unfilmable  this isn t even a credible try  to move the story into the  th century just outrages the original story s intent and nature  possibly you might have been able to move it over to england  but it must be a period piece  even our story narrator the proprietor tells it in a flashback  going back even further  somewhere around   towards the end of the  th century  a strangely disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought  and the  th century  come on  give me an expletive deleted break  even around   such behavior didn t work very well  in view of the ending  and the movie s ending  i don t know what it was  because i didn t watch the entire travesty i had to stop  this was like setting  streetcar named desire  in elizabethan england
