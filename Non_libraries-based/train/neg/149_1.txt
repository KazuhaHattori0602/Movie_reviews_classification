well  you know the rest  this has to be the worst movie i ve seen in a long long time  i can only imagine that stephanie beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role   the lead role is played by  to me  a complete unknown and i would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey   bruce lee led the martial arts charge in the early  s and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques  this movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts  however  even this can t disguise the fact that the lady doesn t know how to throw a punch  an average   year old boy would take her apart on this showing   sorry  the only mystery on show here is how this didn t win the golden raspberry for its year
