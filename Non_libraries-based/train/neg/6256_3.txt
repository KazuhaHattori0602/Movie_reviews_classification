hmm
 i agree with the reviewer who said that  strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film  i thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it  i think that was primarily because of marsden and speedman   not the plot   the bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically tantalizing on the one hand and profoundly homophobic on the other  thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter  i m not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda   i thought the acting was mediocre  a lot of conversation that was about   degrees askew of reality  i kept wanting to derive some meaning from the plot  but it s ultimately just a conversation with a mad man  speedman  i feel mildly sorry for him  speedman  because of his loss  but not really  his loss is no greater and certainly is less than losses suffered every day around the world by more significant causes   does the film expose naivet  about hiv aids  yes  that of the intended audience  is hiv a dark  mysterious  evil killer  what about it s victims  the answer to both questions is no  neither hiv nor its victims have any more or less malevolent intent than lupus  multiple sclerosis  tb  hepatitis  cancer  or their victims  for god s sake  just because a disease is communicable does not make it either deliberate or negligent   or evil   it just is   does this excuse ignorance or fool hardy risk taking    no  should all people practice safe sex    yes  will safe sex save the world    no  is safe sex realistic in all instances of love and lust between passionate and emotional human beings    of course not  what kind of a world would we live in if everyone followed the rules  no one ever took risks  and sex was never spontaneous and passionate  am i ignoring that the film deals specifically with gay sex    yes  hiv is spread by sharing blood or bodily fluids between infected and non infected individuals  sex is not necessary for transmission  gay or otherwise   i m always disturbed by willful violence of one person upon another  i actually thought the film did do a good job of portraying the absurdity of tom s violent abduction  captivity  and intent towards dan  and this kind of insane violence does occur every day   stream of consciousness notes from the film  tom is crazy   why doesn t dan ask  why  do you feel this way  rather than  what are you doing  implication  men who have sex with men get  aids  implication  hiv   aids where was tom s responsibility in the sex act  why was it dan s responsibility to use the condom   maybe you slipped it off before you stuck it in
  what are we talking about here  was one of the parties unconscious   maybe she didn t want to hear the truth  are you kidding me  she s up in heaven and so unbelievably hurt about what she now knows about me  
right
 is dan s life over if he has hiv  certainly not  is this why the whole world is so homophobic  they think gay men are the cause of hiv  that they will give it to the rest of the world  and we will all die
 are you kidding me  are people really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause  is the problem  do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis  of malaria  i can see that tom is hurt because of his wife s death  and he blames it on aids  but seriously
 who s at fault here  the victim or the virus  are illnesses really the responsibility of the ill   presuming they did not seek and did not seek to spread the disease   sure  safe sex is essential to a safe life  but so is not driving  not flying  not leaving the house  not living  do we really want to blame the disease on the victims  would safe sex between tom and dan have prevented tom s wife s ultimate demise  perhaps  but not dan s sole responsibility   tom is crazy  did i mention that   tom to dan   maybe you get what you deserve 
 come on    days  violent  na ve  and homophobic   am i overreacting  perhaps  but i think this film points a judging finger at gay men for their reckless and malevolent intent towards a  straight world  by practicing unsafe sex  when the rate of homosexuals practicing safe sex is proportionately equivalent or better than that of heterosexuals  we all need to wake up and get serious about hiv aids  hiv is killing hundreds of thousands of straight africans every year
