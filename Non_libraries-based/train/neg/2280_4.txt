it s the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others  success  here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier  dracula    and  frankenstein      in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires  in the shape of bats  have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims  even though shot at universal  and at the bronson caves  it s a poverty row feature  it s not fair to compare it with those earlier  more expensively made and superior films   from the familiar and exciting  chilling music of the main titles  which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff  through the talky but well done opening sequence  we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill  fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good  s mystery film  unfortunately  it doesn t happen  that s the disappointment   we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing  low budget  not enough of dwight frye  the overdone presence of maude eburne  aunt gussie  and the premise for lionel atwill  dr  von niemann  to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil  robert frazier  never made very clear   do not watch the technicolor  dr  x      which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter   before watching this the way i did  it s an oscar winner by comparison  so watch this one first  structurally   the vampire bat  still isn t that good  it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief  without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy   besides  dr  x  and  mystery of the wax museum   both   and co starring fay wray  lionel atwill s most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in  son of frankenstein    and as moriarity in  sherlock holmes and the secret weapon    dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in  dracula    as the  young lovers  melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene  but that s about it  he can be seen in  the old dark house    and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in  the most dangerous game    then there s her   classic  screamer  too bad more time  money and rewrites weren t available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill  fay wray and dwight frye  sadly  then  this drearily disappointing film only gets a
