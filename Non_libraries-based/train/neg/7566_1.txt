prior to this release  neil labute had this to say about the   original   it s surprising how many people say it s their favorite soundtrack  i m like  come on  you may not like the new one  but if that s your favorite soundtrack  i don t know if i  want  you to like my film    neil  a word  you might want to sit down for this too  as lord summerisle says  shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent  see  neil  the thing about the original  is that paul giovanni s soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it  the filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical  along with richard and danny thompson  and bert jansch  it practically kick started the  s folk new wave  to undermine it is akin to imagining jaws without john williams  or the buddy holly story without buddy holly  the result s one of the most breathtakingly arrogant  pointless remake of a british cult classic since sly stallone s get carter   the original had apparently left nicolas cage  disturbed for about two weeks  so disturbed  during that fortnight s window  that he pitched the idea of re imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter faith struggle ever devised to a writer director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism  it s like some parlor game  what would you get if sam peckinpah took on bambi  or gaspar  irreversible  noe remade love  actually actually  i d quite like to see that  unfortunately  someone took this parlor game seriously  all labute s succeeded in doing is ripping out the original s guts while saddling it with his own gormless sex war preoccupations   after failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash  cage s highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor  then he receives a letter from ex fianc e willow woodward  this one trades on name homages for kudos  now living on the private island community of summersisle   that extra  s  stands for  superfluous    and wants edward to help locate missing daughter rowan   summersisle  it transpires  is a female dominated joint  conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the salem witch trials  here  the matriarchs observe the olde ways  and the few males are near mute breed mules  it s like lilith fair on a grand scale  summersisle s main export is honey   a symbolic and literal headache for edward  as he s allergic to bees   beekeepers  cries edward   they seem to be everywhere on this island  well  that s probably because summersisle s main export is honey   while making his investigations  edward overhears of an oncoming mayday ritual called  the time of death and rebirth  he discovers the previous year s crop failed  nearly dies from bee stings  and eventually comes to the conclusion  a conclusion which admittedly couldn t be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands  that rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest  he also meets the queen bee of the hive  sister summersisle  burstyn  who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous wicker man   the drone must die    first  the good news  any concerns cage would be airlifted from the wicker man s flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black cia helicopters can be laid to rest  he toast  that s about it for the good news   this is a story whose chapters were carefully written  intones burstyn with sublime irony  though retaining the basic cat and mouse premise  and credits typography  what s left subjects the original to a scorched earth policy   crucial to shaffer s original screenplay was that his christian copper  in accordance with ritual  came to the island of his own free will   and most importantly  was a virgin  the perfect sacrifice  in reducing matters to a sexual  as opposed to a religious power struggle  labute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice  by the time cage has worked out he was the bait  you honestly couldn t care less   and cage is one of the very worst things in this  a lumbering  drawling donkey   an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth   goddamit  he moans after he hallucinates a drowned rowan  with all the mental torment of a man who s set his morning alarm clock half an hour too early  one hopes it s his character s frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state   alternately fatigued  then full of preppy  overbearing vim  if so  it s a fine portrayal of an undistinguished iq addled with anti depressants  if not
it doesn t bear thinking about  as willow  the saucer eyed beahan is similarly dreadful  presenting her lines as if in competition with cage for the
most
half hearted
delivery  while burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince  who s afraid of naomi wolf    every element that made the original great   the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs  the ingenious score  the dialogue  lord summerisle s majestic  you did it beautifully  has been replaced with the rather less attractive  you did it excellently  whoah  dude    have been substituted for a meandering battle of the sexes thriller with occasional crash bang wallop  namely  walloping women  this is a labute flick  after all  cage s sister beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes  impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin  to  em  hyuk hyuk   the closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre clich  in a bar  two guys run into a couple of summersisle maidens on shore leave  flirty fishing for fresh martyrs  at the moment of their successful pick up  you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera   one more thing  keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count  anything up to   tend to be not much cop  the wicker man has   producers in total
