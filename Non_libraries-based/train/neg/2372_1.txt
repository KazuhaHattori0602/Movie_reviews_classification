unimaginably stupid  redundant and humiliating closure to the  nightmare on elm street series  part   is so incompetent that it looks like director rachel talalay intentionally wanted to turn wes craven s initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke  this isn t just the worst entry in the  elm street  saga  it s also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre  the story is dumb  the character drawings are ridiculous  the structure is all murky and   most of all   the special and visual effects resemble those of a tom   jerry cartoon  the sequences in which freddy krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting  were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering freddy turned breckin meyer into a video game character and pogo sticked him around the walls of a house  the story takes us back to springwood and it appears that freddy all of a sudden has a middle aged daughter  you d think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures  but no
 there s only one teenage survivor in springwood and krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter  another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure  the john doe boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults  how about that  freddy krueger  who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers  eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing  d glasses  sort of like ruins the whole essence  doesn t it  as far as i m concerned   nightmare on elm street  has always been a dreadfully overrated series but  up until now  even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements   freddy s dead  however  is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his her precious time watching it
