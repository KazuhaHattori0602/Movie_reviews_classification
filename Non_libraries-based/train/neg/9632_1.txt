i have an awful pan and scan videotape of  boom  and i want to see it in all its widescreen glory  so i voted   and hope you will too  together  we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross  and hope that someone will see an opportunity for big money in releasing  boom  in its director s cut extended version  the movie is one of my howling favorites
you just look at the people involved  the director  the actors  the cameraman  and you say to yourself   yep  i guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time  producers considering the dvd release of  boom  should note that  everywhere it s been shown  there have been sellout crowds in the theaters  but it hasn t been up to frostbite falls yet
