three stooges   have rocket  will travel     this was the first feature length film to star the stooges and it is pretty bad  it makes the three stooges go around the world in a daze  from   look like a masterpiece   the stooges are janitors at a rocket place  they climb into a rocket and it goes to venus  they meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call  uni  which they bring back to earth with them   uni  speaks like an average  pleasant person    oh  hello  how are you  lovely planet here  hope you like it  hilarious   very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on   the stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes  but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another   minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens  the stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over   high point of the film   the end where the stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey  the larry and curly joe hit moe in the face with two pies  brutal   another writer mentioned the fine musical score  huh  the only music i even noticed were two classic tunes   i ll take romance and there goes that song again  both of which are played at the party  and  that  really is the high point of the picture   music from old columbia films   the tall sexy blonde was nice   awful   a brand new vhs video from the   cents only store
