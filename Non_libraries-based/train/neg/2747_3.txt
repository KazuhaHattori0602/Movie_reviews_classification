i knew it would be  but i gave it a rent for some laughs and maybe some mindless fun  anyone whose read a few of my reviews can see that i m pretty easy to please  i really didn t think i d end up feeling this negatively towards it   the plot is about an ancient army of dragons lead by a huge serpent that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who inherited the responsibility can
 become one with
 a good dragon
 or something
 i don t know  it was so stupid  i didn t bother to put much effort into retaining it   it features a really dumb story full of ridiculous moments and goofy concepts  so many of the events just felt totally random and sudden   i assume there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem i have with the movie is the fact that the story seems like it s trying to be so grand and epic  yet everything happens so fast and goes by so quickly  i feel like i ve just been hit with a million plot points and action sequences in one big ball  the film is like a punch in the face  it doesn t take much time at all to establish characters or drama  imagine the  lord of the rings  trilogy in   minutes
 you could have most of the epic battle sequences  but there would be absolutely no buildup and you d hardly care about the outcome of those battles  that was the case with dragon wars
   minutes of me not giving a crap  waiting for it to be over   fantastic cgi with some okay directing  but horrible acting  speedy pacing  and dumb story made this very hard to enjoy on any grounds  i probably would have loved it when i was
