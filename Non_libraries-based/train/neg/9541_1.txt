i suppose many people comment review their first movie on imdb because the movie was spectacular or horrible   i m writing due to the latter   i was excited for the sequel to  wargames    i thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content  i felt it was worth watching more than once  this being   i had high hopes for what they would do with this film  computers  gaming  terror  military over zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film  and  wargames  the dead code  had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick   the movie failed on pretty much every level  but i particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects   the dead code  was a  s air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms  meanwhile  will farmer is button mashing about   commands   none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen  until finally he  wins  by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills   virtual people  nobody is near the gas  because he beat   levels in   minutes  this tells ripley  the real life war machine  that he is a high level terror threat   even though any   year old could complete this same task   the government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity  they say things like  he has expert knowledge of bio terror    he displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first   paragraphs of the wiki entry on bio terror  so then a movie long chase scene with about   of the budget and excitement of any of the bourne titles ensues  they have about   opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter  sometimes they are mad they barely miss him  but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him   ugh  i would write more  but i already wasted   hours watching this  i would rather watch the broderick and joshua play tic tac toe for   hours
