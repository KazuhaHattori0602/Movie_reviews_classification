for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the  s  this isn t it  nor is it a historical drama  rather  it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical shaka  but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to sinclair s idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus  lincoln  superman  and nelson mandela   on the other hand  there are a few laugh out loud moments  as when shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt  you know  like jesus would have done if he hadn t been such a wimp   true  i saw only the  minute version  but i can t imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better   and what kind of a name is mungo
