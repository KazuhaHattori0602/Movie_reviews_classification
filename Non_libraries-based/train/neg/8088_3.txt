to make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director  you need at least one of the two  in this eye of the needle we have none   i don t even remember the name of the director  he mustn t have done much in his career  i like very much donald sutherland but he absolutely cannot be the main actor in a movie  he falls short  sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than   minutes  i would say for instance that sutherland was excellent in jfk of oliver stone when he talked to kevin costner on the bench of a park for   minutes non stop without even taking a breath  wonderful  but sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good   kate nelligan  she is probably good for tv series  the dvd is awful  terrible colors  terrible light  i couldn t even appreciate the scenery of storm island for how lousy the photography was   this ken follett story was good but it s a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie
