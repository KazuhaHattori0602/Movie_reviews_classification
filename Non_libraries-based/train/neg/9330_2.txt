saw this movie recently and had higher hopes  not so much based upon the director  who hadn t made a cinematographic release before  but more based upon its cast  harvey keitel  scott glenn and craig wasson  lead role in body double  a brian de palma masterpiece  have all starred in great movies  not together though  and this fact hasn t exactly changed because of this one   the film is unbelievable  very predictable and clich  the only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it s been shot  in my humble opinion  don t waste your time on this one
