normally  i have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened  when it s done on purpose   but this movie really feels like they got all but the last   minutes done  then realized they had   left to finish on   i saw it on tbs  i recommend you not spend money on it either  if you catch it on tv  watch all but the last   minutes  then walk away and make your own ending in your mind   really  the movie would have been better if they had simply got away  and come back with the state poice of feds only to find that the town and the car graveyard was gone  and by all appearances had never been there    wish i had more thumbs  so i could give that movie   thumbs down
