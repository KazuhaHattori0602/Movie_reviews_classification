sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood  now he wants to broaden his horizons and  spoiler  needs a family member in order to do it   a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain t scary at all  works better as a dark  macabre black comedy  to tell you the truth  freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer   too many wisecracks  that s for sure  the actors aren t interesting  save robert englund  as always  and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto  and there are simply far too many visual effects  the finale is ok but doesn t provide as many sparks as i think one might hope   in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer s story  it provides englund the opportunity to do more non makeup scenes than ever before   there are cameos worth noting  a joint cameo by then couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value  an appropriate appearance by veteran shock rocker alice cooper  and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become   film debut of breckin meyer  who plays spencer   one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits
