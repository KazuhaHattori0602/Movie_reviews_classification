this show had pretty good stories  but bad dialog  the main character was especially annoying  it s quite obvious why this show was canceled  although  like most upn shows  i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re runs   most of it s plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies  leading me to think the producers didn t have an original idea in their heads    i haven t commented enough  you ve got to have at least ten lines of text  the special effect were not bad for a   show   the gnome was a nice character
