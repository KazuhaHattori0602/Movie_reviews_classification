i should have listened  i was warned  and still  i paid money for this  after reading all the reviews  after knowing the original is  so bad it s good  and that part   does not fit into that category at all  still  even then  i couldn t resist  exactly what happened here  part one was hilarious  it had so much politically incorrectness  and other crazy  fat entertainment  and this one  there just couldn t possibly be a worse sequel on god s green earth  not basket case   hell  not even troll   this is truly the worst sequel in history and that s really saying something considering the groundbreaking  bottom of the barrel qualities of the original  criminally insane part   was just a completely different brand of bad  shot on video  zero score  zero entertainment value    consists of flashbacks of the original  and on top of all that  crazy  fat ethel has lost a portion of her girth  i mean  honestly  is this some kind of sick joke  thank s a lot  nick milliard
