i have to confess that i am severely disappointed   this version can in no way compete with the version of   the reason why i watched it was that i wasn t entirely happy with ciaran hinds as captain wentworth and thought that rupert penry jones looked much more like the captain i had imagined when i read the book  and he was too   unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film  the rest is as un austen like as possible   miss elliot would never have run through the streets of bath like this  it wasn t in her character and it just wasn t done by a lady of the those times  the anne elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity  there are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst   although there are   important quotes from the book  they are at entirely inappropriate moments  warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed   and although this version is not much shorter than the other one  it feels like everything is rushed  very little care was taken to introduce the characters  show their dispositions and motives  important scenes were omitted  how could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way   a disaster   and it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other one   no  no  no  if you love austen  then don t waste your time with this
