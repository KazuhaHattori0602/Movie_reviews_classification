absolutely awful movie  utter waste of time   background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech  well if you really listen closely  whatever they speak is actually unintelligible   camera work is bad  editing is not present  background score gives a headache  action is shoddy  dialogs are unintelligible  acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler  now she looks like a starved wrestler  hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace   after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it  but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure    please if you want to torture yourself  go ahead watch this
