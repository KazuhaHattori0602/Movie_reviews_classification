i ll admit that i liked the first one  and was really looking forward to the sequel   i was let down  sure the special effects were technically amazing   but they weren t believable looking  it looked more like a cartoon  alright  i admit to liking   of the chase scene   but the fight with all the mr smiths  it was too obviously animated   i can accept all of that  what i can t accept is that the non action parts were crap  every time morpheus opened his mouth  i knew i was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing   i was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist  what this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie  except about the existence of the matrix  this movie was a little like seeing the episode of dallas where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream   ugh  i want my   back
