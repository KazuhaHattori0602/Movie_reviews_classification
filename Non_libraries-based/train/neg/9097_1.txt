who actually created this piece of crap this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my life it is such a waste of time and money  i hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring d lister actors and a storyline so similar to the  st one   i found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to wild things   and death to the supermodels for   what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the  st one   whoever thought that this straight to video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because i think what pretty much most of the people who ve seen this film thinks what a load of crap
