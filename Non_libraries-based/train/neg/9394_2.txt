oh  man  how low serials had fallen as by   this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes  from misery  not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren t there in the previous chapter  and that couldn t possibly be there   tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode   to   they wouldn t see the characters jump  but i think this serial has the world s record of stock footage  i mean  most of it is stock footage  and not just from another serials  apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men  and the cool  molten rocks  scenes of episode   to   is from adventures of captain marvel  but from itself  the whole  trip to the moon  sequence  which is probably the shortest ever  it s   seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earth s atmosphere  from episode   is repeated in episode   and episode   is all scenes from previous episodes   ever wondered why mst k never did episodes     and   well  they had to stop after   so they didn t have to do the whole thing again   don t get me started on the science factor  prepare to see the sunniest moon ever  and moon men that can not breathe on their own world  what were they smoking    and if this is not enough  it s too talky and the stunts  usually the best thing in serials  are few and far  visually wise  am i the only one who thinks that commando cody s bullet shaped  or is it lemon shaped  helmet is totally ridiculous looking  the rocketeer s was way cooler  no matter how bad that movie was  and man  was it awful  the tank like vehicle isn t much better  it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween  the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk  hey  everybody has the right to be an hero  but then he s so unappealing   not even worth watching for nostalgia s sake  see captain marvel instead      btw  check out the memorable quotes section for a real women s lib pearl
