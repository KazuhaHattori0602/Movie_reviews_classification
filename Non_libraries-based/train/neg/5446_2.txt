for loyal duran duran fans who want to watch a good music video  skip this one  the producers decided to get creative and make this  s video something of a sci fi story  involving the evil barbarella villain from which the band got its name    what makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great  s duran duran songs  confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts  not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted  but we have to suffer through some cheap spin off story hosted by an evil dr  mario  it s almost too much to bear
