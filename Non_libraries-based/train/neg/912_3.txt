 for one of the worst swedish movies ever forgive me for being dull   first of all i haven t seen the first one  i was bored that s my reason for watching the  nd before the  st one  well i hope the first one is better than this  it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes  for the people that have seen this and think   is high  belive me so do i  but it made me laugh a few times  because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea  what s next  det sjunde inseglet ii  sequels not based on novel or book doesn t turning out great to often  and this is a perfect example of one   ok i m gonna be honest with you  i did laugh a bit  it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor  but don t buy it  rent it  just let some other idiot do it or download it     this movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already
