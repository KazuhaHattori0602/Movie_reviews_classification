ugly shot  poorly scripted and amateurishly paced sequel to joe dante s   classic   the howling  is one of the two or three only good werewolf films ever made and yet it got  rewarded  by a series of obnoxious and unendurable sequels like this one  if it s any consolation   stirba  is a sequel in name only and there s absolutely no connection with the characters or events that were introduced in dante s film  the plot here revolves on a bloodthirsty cult of transsylvanian werewolves   primarily female ones   led by stirba  stirba is played by sybil danning who transforms from a curvy old lady into a blond super babe  with impressive bosom  in the blink of an eye and becomes all hairy when sexually aroused  her arch enemy is played by a seemly fatigue christopher lee  his character   stefan crosscoe   is an occult investigator who travels to stirba s kingdom  accompanied by an american couple who lost their friend to the werewolf cult  in case you re exclusively looking for filthy gore and gratuitous nudity this is your film  even the smallest killing is shown in great detail and we re even treated to exploding eyeballs and the vile image of a dwarf who gets pierced on a pointy fence  however  if you want a little substance or depth  you ll be sorely disappointed  the dialogues are embarrassing and there s absolutely no tension to detect anywhere  the scriptwriters constantly seem to confuse werewolves with vampires  the transsylvanian setting  garlic  wooden stakes  and danning s gorgeous balcony is shamelessly exploited as the film s only gimmick  during the end credits  a shot in which she rips off her top  is re edited repeatedly  according to my fellow reviewer dr  gore  no less than seventeen times  which is pretty pathetic and pointless  the music is okay and some of the scenery is rather beautiful  i m talking about the fierce looking statues during the opening credits and the dark dungeons of stirba s castle  the directing by philippe mora is a giant mess and   as far as i m concerned   his only worthwhile film remains  the beast within  released three years earlier
