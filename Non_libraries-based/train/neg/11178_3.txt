firstly i must admit that it isn t a good movie  and i would never watch this movie if pacino wasn t in it   the movie is about a publicist s strange   hours and he is overworked dizzy sick and sometimes regretful i don t like the character at all it s really boring after   minutes you may fall asleep and i don t understand why pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie just because of money or what   since i m an avid pacino fan i bought this   movie people i know if you haven t bought it yet don t even think about it it s just a waste of time
