i see a lot of people liked this movie  to me this was a movie made right of writing   and the person failed the class  from the time lindsey price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable  i kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere   first we have the widowed young father  clich    movies tv always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl  or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children  starting from from my   sons to     dads  these movies are usually dramas and comedies are tv shows   clich      when a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie  and will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead   clich    if the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of latino origin  and they must be illegal  apparently there are no legal latino s and illegal europeans  unless if there is a ira element involved   clich    the said latino must be highly educated in his native country  in this case he was a profesor who made   per month  and the said highly educated latino must now act like he hasn t brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over   clich    the crime the person committed really wasn t a crime but a accident  but because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick   clich    one never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime   but some poor little cute kid  this is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie  and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents   clich    name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie  even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police force  sev n and copy cat and law and order come to mind right away  and the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold   clich    let s go and round up some unemployed soap stars  now i like lindsey price  but susan haskell imo can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on one life to live as marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth  it use to get me sea sick  she might be anchored on land better now  but she still cannot act   the movie might have been more insightful if it wasn t filled with clich s  i don t think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good  but this was just bad    spoiler  now i am not going to spoil the ending  oh heck i will because i feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie  it involves clich    and   unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming  the father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran  who all of a sudden is very upset  you would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake  when she didn t  now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him  guess what happen to her  times up  she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father  come on  you all knew that was going to happen  because she is a replacement child  that is why she did not go and live with the lindey price character    this movie was a insult as far as i was concerned  because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the clich  ridden one  the   stars are for   of the stars  the little girl  who i thought was very good and lindsey price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it  my advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
