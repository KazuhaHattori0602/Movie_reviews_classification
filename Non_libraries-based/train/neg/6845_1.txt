 i went to the movies  to see  beat street    it wasn t bad  it was kinda  neat    krush groove  was a flick  that i didn t mind   but when it came to  rappin  i drew the line  word to your mother   want me to stop   that s just a small sample of the stupa fly style of rhymin  on display in this waste of film and location permits  this movie is seriously wack  thats  s speak for just f cking awful  as an emcee  mario van peebles is one hell of an actor  and as an actor  mario van peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder   any film calling itself  rappin  had better deliver at that genre s highest standard of the time  so why were   year olds rolling in the aisles  even back in the day when standards were so knee high to webster low  because this rap is weak  so weak that not even b e t  or comedy central will touch it with a  foot gold rope chain   blondie s  rapture  is def poetry next to this bit of dr  suess in the hood  so don t be a boobie  avoid this movie
