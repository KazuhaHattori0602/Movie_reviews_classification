i began watching this movie with my girl friend  and after   minutes i was alone   i succeed to stay until the end  it has been a painful experience   i liked jean hugues anglade  but i think that he needed to eat  as us  and thus he accepted to play in this movie    there are only   characters  and the rest could be called  art  or something that i couldn t express  but that i didn t understand at all   the only worst movie i saw was crash  but i m pretty sure now that i have enough experience to watch it successfully again   good luck   o
