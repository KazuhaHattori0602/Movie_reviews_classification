exceedingly complicated and drab  i m a bright guy  but this was just too much for a tired brain  it would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing  probably better for the us market  gc himself hinted that this alone did not supply his oscar and you can see why   still the sand dunes are pretty  the nail pulling is nasty  the attorneys drunk dad is a mystery  the cricket is good to see   very difficult to write the required ten lines on this  despite it being over   hours long  thank heavens they shortened it  admittedly we don t get to the pictures much  but the last film we saw  walk the line  was   times better and i don t really like johnny cash  my wife says george still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there s that am i nearly there yet    how about now
