for a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull   nothing much happens and even when things do happen they don t generate any real excitement or interest   the acting is good from the two leads  cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to   the problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it isn t interesting  succo is not a unique character  he isn t interesting or exciting   films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it
