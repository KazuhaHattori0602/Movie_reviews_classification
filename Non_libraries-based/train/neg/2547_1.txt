i haven t seen it in over twenty years  oj was the bus driver  arte johnson was the tour guide  lorenzo was the kidnapper   yea  lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain  a natural  i think i watched it back then most for oj  who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing  but also to see arte johnson   i was a little bored that johnson was so serious   and yes  it shifted plots  in reading other posts  i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl  but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue   i was going  a stamp  if it came on as a late movie  i would probably record it to check it out again  but i wouldn t be nostalgic over it  not yet anyway   there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out
