i rated basic instinct   high  yet that movie got less than a   rating  this film only got a   from me  but it has   from over   people  i don t see a reason why they like this film so much   this film is boring  because it hardly ever leaves those rooms in that broken big house  and it only has a total of   people in this film  it is almost two hours long which is totally unnecessary  many of dialogues are slow and meaningless  the film tone is also dark blue which is depressing to watch  the film can just be shorten to a few sentences   this film reminds me of  three times  directed by hou hsiao hsien  that one is equally boring  the dialogues are also equally boring  it also has a high rating  i had to stop watching that one after the first story finished   this film lacks of passion or excitement
