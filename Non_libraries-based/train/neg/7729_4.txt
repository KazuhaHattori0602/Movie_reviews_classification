a wonderful television mini series completely ruined by a  year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a  year old ingenue  no exaggeration   that s the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor  this tv mini series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up   that alone makes this completely unwatchable  despite the fact it s one of the best filmed wwii  global  dramas tv has ever produced  if you have the stomach   or a decent fast forward ability   you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance    i m stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story  pun intended  did they watch the film with their eyes closed  or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their  selective memories  and  selective vision  i m a boomer myself so don t think for a second i m some hubristic young punk    will always look   get used to it  deal with it  age gracefully damnit   the winds of war could have been  so good  how much more would we be talking about this mini series today  some   years later  had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important   critical role  right now  with the constant haggard old biddy distraction  that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war
