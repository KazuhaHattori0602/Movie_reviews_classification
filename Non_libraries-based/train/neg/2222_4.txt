carlo verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism   then something happened  and he turned into just another dull  holier than thou  director   il mio miglior nemico can more or less be summarized in one line  working class   kind and warm  while upper class   snob and devious  but love wins in the end   such a trite clich  for such a smart director   there isn t really too much to talk about in the movie  every character is a walking stereotype  the self made man who forgets his roots but who ll become  good  again  the scorned wife  the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest but poor guy  acting is barely average   severely disappointing under every aspect
