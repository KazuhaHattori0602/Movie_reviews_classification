some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to earth  decided to disregard what he d heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans  reinventing them as mythical giants that were   feet tall  is beyond ridiculous  there was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world  that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans  these were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a   to   foot human  somewhat supporting the  david and goliath  tale from the bible  there is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a   foot tall being  if i was rating this movie on my own scale  it would have been a negative value instead of a one
