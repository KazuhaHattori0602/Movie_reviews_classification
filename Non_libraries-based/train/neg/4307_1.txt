seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable  it prompted me to exclaim  oh my god  more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly   fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable  near impossible  human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist   if you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one  otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time    that a film released in   is already being shown on tv in july   might give an indication of the film s quality
