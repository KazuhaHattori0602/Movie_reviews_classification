with an absolutely amazing cast and crew  this might have been a classic  instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in   about the jfk assassination grafted  rather pointlessly  on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president kegan in   many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do   sterling hayden or eli wallach  for instance  or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top   john huston  jeff bridges and anthony perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well  in their very different ways  though   the photography is gorgeous  but does not justify an hour and a half of your life  or the price of the dvd purchase
