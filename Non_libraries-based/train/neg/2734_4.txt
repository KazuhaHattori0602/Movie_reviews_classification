but  lets face it  it got a few nostalgic sighs out of me   the show is just so consistently great that it is allowed to have a few hiccups  i get a new season  and just power through them like i have  days to live  i like the idea of wrapping it up  but it was much more of an end of season episode which would explain the following   dr cox isn t supposed to be bald for a couple more episodes  only explanation i can think of is they changed the rotation of the episodes or had to re shoot the beginning   and that my friends  is why the hell cox is bald   anyways  the show is awesome bring on the  th season
