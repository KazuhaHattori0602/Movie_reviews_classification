loony tunes have ventured  at least  twice into the future  the first time was with the brilliantly funny  duck dodgers  the latter time was with this 
 um 
 effort   loonatics unleashed  isn t without merit  and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn t up to warner brothers quality  wb cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor  appealing at least as much to adults as to children  these pedestrian superhero episodes  on the other hand  cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up   the premise of the series is that   ordinary individuals   bunnies  a tasmanian devil  a duck  a roadrunner  and a coyote  live on the  city planet  of acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in   what s confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count up to   from the  st century  cute  but frelling stupid   in each episode  the super sextet   amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter   fight various super villains  for the most part  these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones  like many mediocre superhero series  this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context  and of course these guys are the only characters that laugh   the usual evil laugh  of course  why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always   always   laugh evilly at every opportunity  animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and  occasionally  their henchpeople and or henchthings   in point of fact  the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get go  the superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities  but sometimes not  the problem here is that we don t see enough wb looniness  lexi and ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as  bugs like  what we have here is basically the silly and drekish  teen titans  including its overly  modern  animation  look  but with animals  feh   the other misstep by the program s creators is  or are  the villains  as noted before  these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil laugh bit excessively  amazingly  the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock wb characters as well as the protagonists  adding to the fun could have been  say  jupiter sam   as well as the fudd  still hunting wabbits   as well as tech e  coyote converted into a really neurotic villain   and so on  ah  the sadness of missed opportunities
   sadly  this whole production has gone into too much overtime  that is  a  nd season  nevertheless  we can rejoice that there s something new out there for the  going on  crowd  the rest of us can hope for a  rd season of duck dodgers
