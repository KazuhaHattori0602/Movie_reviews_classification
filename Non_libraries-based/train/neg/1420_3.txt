[i saw this movie once late on a public tv station  so i don t know if it s on video or not ]  this is one of the  baby burlesks   sic  that shirley temple did in the early  s  it is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of  kiddie porn   shirley temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of   they are all in diapers  and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol  the  cash  is in the form of lollipops   shirley playing a  femme fatale  sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her   but shirley doesn t need really their lollipops cash because her purse is full of ones from other  men   meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table    what a strange film       infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon  who thought up this stuff any way
