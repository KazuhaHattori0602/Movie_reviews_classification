 this might mean the end of the white race  gasps a general as a dozen native zombies wander around the battlefields of europe during the  great war  an expedition sets out tor the long lost  back projected city of kennif angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands   it is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden  even by   standards the acting in this film is bad  from a previous decade  it looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on  how to act      chapter three  emotions     how to express fear and loathing  female  clench both fists  place fist of one hand on heart  open mouth as it to scream  place other fist  palm out  against mouth  hold pose for   seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head   degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob    how to have difficult  heavily emotionally charged scene with ex fianc  explaining your love for someone else  do not make eye contact  do not move  do not show any emotion  do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall    to give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors  thus   minute s worth of story is padded out to  ish minutes   the revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow  released from mental bondage the armies of ex zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window   yea  let s  oh  i dunnno yeah  let s get him grrr  frankenstein must be destroyed   manana   though i have just found a bit of hidden symbolism  jagger is shot by a native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the natives being shot by the germans at the start of the flick  see  even downtrodden natives don t want the end of the white race  the chase  it you can call it that  through the back projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone  roy d arcy has a hell of a time camping it up  but is totally wasted  as col  mazovia   there is one interesting moment in this film  a nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell  face after face  cross fade into one another  it works  though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut  i guess these must be neg cutters  frames between the fades   best watched with friends and in a silly mood
