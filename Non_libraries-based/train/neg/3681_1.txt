my goodness is this movie bad  i was totally misled by my local movie review because this is certifiable garbage  yeah  yeah  good guys wear white  bad guys wear black and the good guys always win  now go home and hug your kids  and feel how good hollywood has made you feel  blech  i can t believe this brain dead movie was made by wes craven  i m guessing he needed a little money to pay the mortgage  so he made this piece of dung  it is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director   ya see  a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a wittle il  bad thing or he s gonna hurt her daddy  but being ms  all american girl next door  we know she s gonna save the day and beat the bad guys the end  girl power rocks   c mon now  only an idiot would find this entertaining a roller coaster ride  let alone something fresh or new  all those  super duper  reviews you see on this site are from industry hacks who are either making money off this flick  paying back a favor  or they have sold their souls to the devil   rachael mcadams is beautiful yup  that s it  not a good performance  not a horrible one she s just cute  she would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie  she isn t tough enough to be a good female action lead   cillian murphy was at least passable in   days  but here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one  he gets his ass kicked to and fro by the   mcadams  because after all  she was a cheerleader and a field hockey player and i m sure she owns all the tae bo tapes so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire  i wouldn t trust him to steal a pack of gum from    ya see  this movie was done before  except before they did it well  go re rent any of the die hard movies  you have loved ones in danger  international terrorists  except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are way more competent and interesting  i simply don t understand how hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy  no wonder movie revenues are down   throw your   down the toilet and save yourself   hours of your life you ll never get back   ciao  freddyshoop
