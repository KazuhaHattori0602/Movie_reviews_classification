next to the slasher films of the  s and  s  ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub genre  while slasher films had  black christmas  and  halloween  to get the whole thing going  zombie flicks had george romero s  dead  films  and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series  other directors wanted to cash in  a lot of italian directors were especially interested  such as lucio fulci who brought us  zombie  a year after romero s  dawn of the dead  known as  zombi  in italy and some other countries  and it was there that fulci s film was known as  zombi   apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero s film  but is a good film in it s own right  it was a big success in europe and   years later a sequel was born   pros  lots of beautiful  lush scenery  awesome score  the acting isn t exactly good  but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience  after kind of a slow start  the pace moves along like that of an action flick  plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers  good job on the make up effects  lots of blood and some decent gore   cons  virtually plot less  nothing you haven t already seen before  blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of  return of the living dead  films  cardboard characters  hasn t aged too well due to the bad  s rock music not that i m saying all rock music of that period is bad  clothing  and overall feel of the movie   final thoughts  first of all  this is not a true sequel to fulci s cult classic  in fact  i don t know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off  for those that don t know  fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei  mattei s films are pretty laughable  but like this film many are good campy fun  and that s all this film really is  just something to watch for fun   my rating     so bad it s good rating     serious rating
