i ve always liked fred macmurray  and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch  pair these two major and attractive stars together  add top supporting players like jean dixon  anthony quinn  dorothy lamour and charles butterworth  give them a romantic script  team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you get
a mediocre movie experience   skid johnson  fred  and maggie  carole   meet cute  during her visit to the panama canal  and spend the next few weeks falling in love  skid s a great trumpeter  so he embarks on a musical career  which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall  during his climb to musical stardom  he neglects maggie  who later inspires him to start over after he s hit rock bottom  ah  yes
it s the true hollywood happy ending  which comes none too soon   stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success  but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times  the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever  and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york  fred and carole try their best  but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance  even the final scene  in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment  just doesn t ring true   this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard  however  i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about   hours
