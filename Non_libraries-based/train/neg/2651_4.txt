the first  min of the flick was choppy and hard to know just what was going on  unless you read the book   which i had not   if you can stick with the first half  the second half is sweet   predictable  yes  but sweet none the less   the way it was shot one would think it was produced in the early  s  not    no stand out moments  bland  but it moved along without boring me   i would like to know why keaton selected this role  her part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance
