i haven t seen this    don t plan to see this movie or any other that includes lindsay unless   until  poor little rich girl  straightens out her life for a   year period beginning with her most recent arrest in july    in fact  i don t know anyone that has gone to see any of lindsay s recent movies  i rather imagine   will be the high water mark in her movie making career  until she cleans up her act  all of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career  if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies   up to this time  movie producers have actively sought lindsay for roles in their upcoming production  now  lindsay will probably have to go to auditions   actually compete for any role  her reputation is currently  poison    quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in   sooooo now lindsay is going to have to deal with  not being wanted is she going to be able to handle this   i wonder if even jay leno will want to have lindsay back on his tv show   all of the foregoing is merely my opinion  i have no inside information
