the biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say zues takes dutch commands  but she is speaking german to him  the   languishes are completely different  its like saying  well he takes french commands  and start talking spanish   james belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest  the role just doesn t fit him  even if its mend to be a comedy   to many stereotype predicable stuff  typical comment or comebacks   if you don t look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on tv  but i wouldn t suggesting renting it
