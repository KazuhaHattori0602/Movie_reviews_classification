the special effects of this movie are  especially for its time  laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can t deny their terrible existance   the acting redefines the term  terrible overacting  at the hands of meg foster and richard joseph paul  where julie newman and andrew divoff just redefine  bad    spoilers   the charm in this movie can be found in two things  first is the excellent casting of carel  lurch  struycken as the mysterious psychic gaunt  who can sense where and when people will die and is always there   the second are original finds  the combination sf western is obviously original  if terrible  but other finds are more original  like the gunman zack stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots  though his acting falls short here   overal don t see this movie  except if you love that ol  hunk o brutal carel struycken  as any self respecting dutchman should
