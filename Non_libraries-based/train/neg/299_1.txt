this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana  and agnisakshi   agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better film  daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here  the story was good but the handling wasn t that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing  direction is bad music is good  rishi reprises his role of yaarana strangely which also was a remake of swte  and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
