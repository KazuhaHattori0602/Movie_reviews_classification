after hearing about george orwell s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life  i m now   but never having read the book  i am totally confused as to what i ve just seen   i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel  as i m sure most are  but only through hearsay and quotes  without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery  and even with it i m still no more educated about the story of   than i was before i watched it   on the plus side   the cinematography is amazing  hurt   burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate  the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making   now for the down sides  and there are plenty   there is a war going on   at least as far as the propaganda is concerned  but why   with who  nothing is explained  there are a couple of names bandied about  eurasia etc  but they mean nothing without explanation   who is winston  what does he do  where does he come from  where does he work  why is he changing news reports  why isn t he on the front line  why doesn t he eat the food in the canteen  what is that drink he s drinking through the entire film  why is he so weak   ill  why isn t he brainwashed like the rest of them  what s the deal with his mother   sister  what happened to his father  a little back story would have been nice  no scrub that  essential for those like myself that haven t read the book  without it  this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on   the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on  i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it s very annoying all the same   also  i know this has been mentioned before  but why all the nudity  it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage   i personally can t abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days  we are not all brainwashed simpletons  but this is a few steps too far the other way  i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you ve read the book because if this film really is the  literal translation  that i ve seen many people say  i would find it very hard to understand why   is hailed as the classic it is   there s no denying that it was light years ahead of it s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date   maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be  but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline   i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i m to make any sense out of this   all in all  very disappointed in something i ve waited for years to watch
