ok  i know that the wanna be john hughes movies of the  s were all unilaterally flat  so the expectations for this film ran pretty low   still  after sitting through this crap there s one key thing i can t seem to get out of my head   i just sat through an  s rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them   the acting is awful  the characters boring and flat  the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult  and the rowing scenes unexciting  uneventful  and inaccurate   unless you ve got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays  or i guess  rob lowe  fetish  there s really no reason to see this one
