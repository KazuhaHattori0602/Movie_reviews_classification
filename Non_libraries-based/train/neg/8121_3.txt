time is precious  this film isn t  i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time   the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction  is this the film the critics are raving about  what a piece of crap   the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family  get it   the acting is superb   the production  lighting  sets  editing  sound  is about   steps above a   minutes story  the characters are shallow and unintelligent  i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience  the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next   i have had more fun doing the laundry
