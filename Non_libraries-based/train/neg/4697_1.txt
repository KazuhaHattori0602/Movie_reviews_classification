okay i saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie  first off the movie is so posed and not real  they are all acting  they can t sing  they are way too full of themselves  its awful  yes kids like   to   might enjoy but its really stupid  i mean they say their manager is a kid  and there record label is fake  its stupid  don t see it   as for the set up and directing  not so bad  it is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing    only see this if you don t really like good music  also  it s very corny  it s not even tasteful  i hate to be so mean but this really is a piece of junk
