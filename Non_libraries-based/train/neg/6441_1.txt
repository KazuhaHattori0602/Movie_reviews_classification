when i looked at this years wrestlemania s match card  i was so stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement   it starts and it ends   i m sitting there  angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back  i mean  you watch wrestlemania    one of my favorites  which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then  the one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when hbk tapped out  that very moment of hbk losing to john cena  john cena is such a loser poser  it almost ruined wrestlemania   for me when he beat triple h  i couldn t watch wwe after seeing wrestlemania   i m starting to watch it again  luckily  i again have faith in wwe after wrestlemania    the greatest i have ever seen  which was a pure classic wrestlemania  it definitely made up for  mania   and gave us lots of memorable moments as well   if you have watched any of the wrestlemanias before this one  like the ones that turn you into fans  wrestlemania   turned me into a fan  please don t watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave wwe behind  and if you do watch it and are angry  start watching it again and watch wrestlemania   it is absolutely classic
