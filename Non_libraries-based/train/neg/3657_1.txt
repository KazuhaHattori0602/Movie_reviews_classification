whoever made this nonsense completely missed the point  jane is a silly comic strip to titillate without being sleazy   this giant mess tries to be funny and exciting but is just a shambles  there is not one decent performance in it even the usually reliable jasper carrott is painfully unfunny   the american bloke whose name escapes me is just as rubbiush as he was in flash gordon   maud adams tries as a villianess but she is a bit long in the tooth for this type of thing  all of these things would not matter if the girl was sexy or funny or likable she is not  kirsten holmes faded into obscurity after this and so much the better   i ve flushed more entertaining things than this down the toilet  avoid
