the sentinel represents everything about the soul lessness of hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days  i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it  it s all so generic  so factory made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting  undeserving public   a plot about a secret service agent planning to assassinate the prez could well be entertaining  if handled by a good director or caring cast that is  douglas is the one who is framed  basinger is the first lady  with whom he is having an affair  an undeveloped  unresolved plot contrivance  sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn t  and longoria is nothing  a woman with a fortune of maybelline and that s it  i guess there are less requirements for women when entering the secret service  as usual in a film like this the role of the prez himself is nothing more than a tool  a token and is very badly written   clark johnson s  he who gave us the equally as pathetic swat back in   mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tv movie  douglas  basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phone in their performances from afar  eva longoria  the most over exposed woman of the  st century  is basically only in this to attract to the desperate housewives audience  her role is   pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development  she barely has   lines to rub together  a truly shameless marketing ploy   if you re a glutton for punishment then don t let me stop you  but it is time and money you won t be getting back
