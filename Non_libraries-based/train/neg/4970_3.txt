good folks  i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers  my academic specialty is anglo saxon literature  and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves  the icelandic  beowulf and grendel  is the least offensive i have seen  and i did pay   for my copy  this sci fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version  yuck   what didn t i like  cgi for one  amazingly bad  more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline  not to mention the stilted acting  i am used to both with all the versions i have seen   delighted regardless  peter
