this movie is not the same as the   version with judy garland and james mason  and that is a shame because the   version is  in my opinion  much better  i am not denying barbra streisand s talent at all  she is a good actress and brilliant singer  i am not acquainted with kris kristofferson s other work and therefore i can t pass judgment on it  however  this movie leaves much to be desired  it is paced slowly  it has gratuitous nudity and foul language  and can be very difficult to sit through   however  i am not a big fan of rock music  so it s only natural that i would like the judy garland version better  see the   film with barbra and kris  and judge for yourself
