al pacino  kim basinger  tea leoni  ryan o neal  richard schiff  my mouth was watering  i dropped everything to watch this movie on cable    minutes in i was having trouble staying awake    minutes in and i hit the record button and fell asleep  finished watching it the next morning  shouldn t have bothered  what a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a  day in the life  cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie  i guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep  dialogue horrible  continuity non existent  camera work could have been done with a hand held super   and looked better    this movie was a total disaster
