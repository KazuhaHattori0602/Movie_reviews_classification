ok this movie was made for one reason and one reason only to make money the producers obviously didn t care about killing a classic horror movie  i knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg  how many pg  slashers movies have turned out to be good  thats like asking how many women have been on the moon  the answer is none  prom night   was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that   my problem with prom night   is the way that it handles the killer and i have   major problems with him    the way he escapes  he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent  what the hell  why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room  do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something   his intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self  he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her  so does he want to kill her  love her or just plain rape her    the killer is too good  how did he develop all of his skills  he used to be a teacher  so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while hes basically on top of her asleep and she doesn t notice  it all silly   stars out of   terrible silly stupid attempt at a horror movie
