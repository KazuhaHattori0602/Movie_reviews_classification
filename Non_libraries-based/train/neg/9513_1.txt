i tried to watch this movie three separate times  the night i rented it  got through about   minutes hoping it would be better if i had a night s rest  watched   more the next day  almost vomited at how stupid it was  it wasn t even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s  if you know what i mean in the censored world we live in  and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn t enjoy one single moment  not even one  how did this script get greenlighted  oh boy   g      the one is for cheerleaders  they deserve at least something for all their hardwork
