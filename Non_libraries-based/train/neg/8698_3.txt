okay  i remember watching the first one  and boy did it suck  after watching it  i just laughed it off and told myself   oh boy  just another low budget b movie  i ll never see a part   to this one  then  about     years later  there came part two  it sucked even more  but  i just laughed it off again and said   there s no way i m ever gonna see a part   to this one  then  about   a year later  part   came out  i was stupid enough to rent it and boy  i just snapped after watching it  god  i never actually realized how much movies can suck these days  just save yourself   and don t rent the whole series  trust me  it s worth every penny
