i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre  and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones  infamous director demofilo fidani  however  is rightly known for some of the cheapest  trashiest  and  well  worst contributions to the genre  the plots of fidani s movies were usually very weak  and since his talent was quite limited  he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like  django  of  sartana  to the titles  i the particular case of  gi  la testa  hombre  of   he just took the title of sergio leone s  gi  la testa   aka   duck you sucker  and added  hombre  the movie can be found under various titles  fistful of death   western story  i personally bought it under the name  adios companeros  which this movie shares with another fidani film with almost the same cast   per una bara piena di dollari  which is also entitled  adios companeros  in the german language version   the plot is rather weak  it basically follows a guy named macho callaghan  jeff cameron  and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy  jack betts  and ironhead  gordon mitchell   the leading performance by jeff cameron is  kindly stated  not very convincing  neither did i find jack betts very good as  butch cassidy  b movie legend gordon mitchell  however  is always worth a try  and although he probably wasn t a very good actor  i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original  and he actually saved some of fidani s movies  such as the rather crappy  django and sartana  showdown in the west   there is one very funny and original thing about  gi  la testa  hombre    the great klaus kinski is playing a priest  i could have imagined kinski in any role  but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest  kinski is  once again  great  although he has only little screen time  and one scene  where he breaks up a fight  is probably the only good scene in this  one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe d amato did the cinematography    gi  la testa  hombre  is a cheap  crappy film  but nevertheless  it has some funny moments  being a spaghetti western enthusiast  i found it fun to watch  but if you re not  never mind this movie  or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest
