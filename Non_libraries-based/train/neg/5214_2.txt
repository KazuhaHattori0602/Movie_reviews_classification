metamorphosis i am working my way through the chilling classics   movie pack collection and metamorphosis is the seventh movie in the set  released in   metamorphosis seems to be a remake of  the atom age vampire  which also featured a scientist striving for similar results  set in modern times  metamorphsis is not my kind of horror movie   a university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging  pressured by the administration to publish his papers  and  produce some results  or risk losing funding  the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig  at first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects  he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner    the acting is stilted  and  the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film  the score is pandering  and  the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious  it s absurd  it s ridiculous   at best    as others noted  the end turns into a   minute gag  which is seemingly endless  without giving too much away  i d call this one   dr  jekyll and mr  hyde meet the creature from the black lagoon meets home alone
