having seen the first ten episodes  i must say this show sucks    what bothers me the most  is that the show was shot in canada  i know it s cheaper  but they should have shot it in california  so we could have had scenes in the desert  that would have been more true to the movie  the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains  with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold  that does nt feel very egyptian  what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt  here it feels like they re running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest  and it s so lame that appaerantly  on other planets  the fall comes as well  you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver  it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb    and then there is richard dean anderson  he is no kurt russel  sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit  but he is just not as cool as russel  and not nearly as good an actor as russel  and russells way of playing o neill  well he was much more cynical  andersons o neil  is way too soft  i liked it that russels version just did nt give a s  and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie    michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spader   teal c is a really annoying character  he is jaffa  not a jaffa  just jaffa  aaaarrgh  a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character  seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far  teal c speaks talks and acts like a robot  i ve seen better acting from jean claude van damme   and the fact that teal c and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie  can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb  what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters    as for the special effects  they are really good in the pilot  but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap  especially a planet they visit with crystals  it s so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background  it s an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap  especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds    the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in   that was   years before sg  started  and they did nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode  that sg  supposedly had  they must have spend all the money on catering  because i don t see it on the screen    incredibly boring and pointless show  that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters
