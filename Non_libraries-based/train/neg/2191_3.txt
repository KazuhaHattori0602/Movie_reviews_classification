a doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success  his final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend s head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle   i was looking for cheese and with this premise i believed i found it  it has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for   chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs  unique camera angles  i always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars  cheesy clarinet stripper music  and one of the longest death scenes in movie history  but unfortunately these so bad they are good moments can t overcome the too bad they stink stretches   jan in the pan annoyed me  with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper  the somewhat less than evil laughter  and the fact she was kept alive with some columbian home brew coffee and   dd batteries   i couldn t even entertain myself with dr bill s horrid overacting and moral self righteousness  usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion  in this case i was bored with it   the best part of the movie in my opinion was the  s version of  body shopping  and i even found myself nodding off during that   don t spend money on this one   there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor
