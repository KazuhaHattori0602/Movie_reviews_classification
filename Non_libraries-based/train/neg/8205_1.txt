very bad acting  and a very shallow story  not even a decent b movie  events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame   this is one of the worst sci fi i ve ever seen  i saw the   stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre  but it sucked so bad   now there s really very few good movies on alien subject  i think because most of them are low budget  i give it
