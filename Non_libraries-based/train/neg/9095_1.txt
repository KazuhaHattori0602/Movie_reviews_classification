i don t usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to  i have spoken of taste in another review  saying it s all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film  if you like it  it simply means you have bad taste   i love films  i loved  isle of the dead  which is pretty much an unknown b w film  i even liked  scream  and  scary movie  i liked these films because they have  if not a lot  at least something good about them  i appreciate   of the films i ve seen because they tell a story which i haven t heard before  and most directors only make films with a good storyline  throughout this film i was thinking  where is this going   even near the end   where did they get these awful actors from   was that supposed to be a joke  and suchlike  with the obvious twist looming i was sceptical  but hoped it would perhaps  make  the film and prove i hadn t wasted my time  i was sadly mistaken  the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was  here s a rundown  storyline   much like the first film  which was alright  this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations  the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable  the twist was terrible  it didn t make me feel a thing  like excitement or wow  just  my god  there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think  oooo wasn t that clever  because it wasn t  in  fight club  there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tyler s true identity was cryptically shown  and when you watched it again you saw more  it really was a work of genius  how it was written  laid out and directed  this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist  i think it was  wild things  that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn t trying too hard to be a big twist  its like the ci  writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever  but really  its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end  the film ended almost immediately afterward  with the whole film void by sebastian s whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced  paedophilic ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl  acting   the actors in this film are appalling  almost as bad a  sunset beach    extremely corny and badly performed  it s not even so bad it s good like  hunk  the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn  it was a rigid  pathetic and badly thought out performance by her  robin dunne was also poor  i haven t seen  american psycho ii  yet  but no doubt his laid back  cool  style has ruined that film also   i can t even say it is a good film for teens  as its not  if my son or daughter liked this film i d be ashamed  but they wouldn t anyway  as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film  which this film has none of  really  i m disappointed that some have said  you might not be in the age bracket for this film  and so dislike it  i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste  also  do you really think that when you reach   you suddenly don t like any teenish story lines  no  i liked  mean girls  and other generic teen films  and watch  beverly hills   all the time  there s no excuse for poor directing  acting and screenplay i m afraid  besides  i was   when i first watched it  if anything  being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film  i can t believe anyone can give it   either  one of my favourite films is  memento  and i gave it   as i know there can be better  it is a shame for this site that people do that  give  s flippantly  or don t get the films show  and so give it    anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste  and perhaps their lives  and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made   worse than  loch ness   if you aren t a teenager with bad taste  or simply don t have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film
