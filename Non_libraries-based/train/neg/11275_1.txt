this is a truly abysmal `lock stock  clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script  i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk  they must have been bribed  a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i hadn t have paid good money for it i d have turned it off after   minutes  not the worst film ive ever seen  that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a  movie   i use the term loosely  `gummo   i feel like suing that so called `director  for the lost hour and a half of my life  but this trash is nearly right down there with it  definitely one of the worst   films i have ever seen  stuff like this reminds hollywood that they don t have a monopoly on truly awful films
