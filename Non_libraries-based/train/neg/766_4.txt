whenever a columbo story deviates from the familiar plot  colorful killer commits crime  columbo smokes out killer  columbo becomes a pest in the process  the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes  this episode deviates in the extreme  and the result is a major flop    would you believe  columbo never faces the villain till the very end   frankly  i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through    oh  the sacrifices we self appointed reviewers make
