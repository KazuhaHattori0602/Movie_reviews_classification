i remember when the golden child was released in   it was universally panned by the critics   and i`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it  it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face   bad guys enter the temple  child sits with blank expression  bad guys chop up the monks  child sits with blank expression  bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with   go on guess   you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression   this movie would be better titled the wooden child  the title sequence starts and being a movie from the  s a pop soundtrack features heavily   obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in   it seems very dated   not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening   in fact that`s the main problem   and boy it`s a serious one   with this movie   the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together   i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too   did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be   it`s part fantasy   part martial arts   part buddy movie   part comedy and it`s all crap
