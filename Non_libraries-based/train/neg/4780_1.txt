i think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons i have ever watched  i would recommend this cartoon to people who are under   i did used to like this show when i was   and   i still only watched it when there was nothing on  now i am other   and i would rather do my homework than watch it  the cartoon used to be a bit funny but they were not enough to make me burst out laughing  now i am older i am interested in show witch are not rated us  i have started to watch doctor who  a  torchwood   and sarah jane adventures  pg  i am interested in things to do with doctor who so i am not interested in   year old cartoons  this cartoon didn t last very long it only had   seasons  it got cancelled because of it was low on viewers but some people say it was because the writers ran out of ideas but for most other shows they have at least   seasons
