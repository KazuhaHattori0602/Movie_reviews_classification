a drama at its very core   anna  displays that genuine truth that all actors age  and sometimes  fade away  anna is a character that believes america is her safety net  her home  and it can do her no wrong   but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn t believe in  she is hard nosed  optimistic  stubborn  and arrogant when it comes to her life  yet not afraid to let others in  yet drop them at a moments notice  anna flip flops between personalities  which makes this film ideal of an aging star  but not idea of the viewing audience   anna  has been praised for its star sally kirkland  and her ability to get  grungy  for the role  but a month into    anna  does not remain a staple of film culture  it is dated  dull  and formulaically chaotic   director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within  anna  about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia  both politically and socially  but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her  bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera  to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out  and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film  it is kirkland you remember  if it isn t obvious  this film didn t sit well with me  from the opening of the first act and deep within the second   anna  felt like a high school theater production  the characters were non existent  there was no enlightening pre story  and there was no definition of time or place  there was sally kirkland  stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants  randomly she encounters a friend  a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour  and two of them  within the span of   minutes  build a friendship that could break all walls  it is emotionally boring and unbelievable  again  randomly  we meet anna s boyfriend daniel  played by the weak robert fields  who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character   only to boost the attention onto kirkland s anna  through the course of nearly two hours  we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads   and sally kirkland  arg  it pains me to continue to say this but  anna  could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna  daniel  and krystina  but instead we are forced into a one sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot   is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beauty less role in  monster  or halle berry in  monster s ball  was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction  throughout this film i was disgusted by kirkland s portrayal of anna  and bogayevicz s lack of excitement for anything else fluent  bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesn t work hard for her parts  doesn t care for others  and is generally mean spirited   yet we are to feel sympathy for her  near the beginning of the film  she forces what she wants to do onto others  and gets upset when she doesn t get her way  sure  aging actresses my have that appeal to them  but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one  that is where  anna  could have improved  if this was a mature kirkland  i would have gobbled it up  but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe  while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing  included is absurd make out characters  and the film burns  this scene is also one of my least favorite  anna has made a phenomenal life for herself  creating films and building the dream  yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight  she gets jealous and outraged  this didn t make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars  coupled with the classic  s background synthesizer  the outrageous over the top wardrobe  and the displaced ending  where did that come from and what happened     anna  slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema  it was a show piece  an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time  in this one it worked  but i don t think i will be fooled again   overall  i cannot say that i was impressed with this film   anna  is not a film about an aging film star  it is about sally kirkland  and only sally kirkland  bogayevicz tries to do more with the story  but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn t enough to support a full story  there are one or two decent scenes in this film  but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential  bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe  tear up for  or dedicate a sunday afternoon with   he created an annoyance  kirkland wasn t anna  she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides  perhaps i missed the scope of this film  but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved  that wasn t the case here  in  anna  kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog  apparently as a symbolic act  and yet during the entire emotional scene  i couldn t help but think that was what kirkland was like to those on the set  she didn t make this into a film  she transformed it into her own production  and because of it  anna  failed  i cannot suggest this to anyone   from one czech to another   skip it    grade      out of    for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out
