two kinds of movies we like are   westerns  and   movies from   or   years ago  we ought to have liked a man called sledge  but   but  this picture is disagreeable  annoying and stupid from start to finish  since there is nobody in the story  good or bad  to warm up to  there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested  no camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold  and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it  sledge has a pretty girl friend  but there s no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no account pig   the film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score  and from extremely bad writing and direction by vic morrow   of the last   older movies rented from netflix or video vault  this was the rock bottom  the only true dud in the bunch
