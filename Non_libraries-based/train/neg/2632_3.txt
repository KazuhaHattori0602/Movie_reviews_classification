it saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors  locations and genres  i e  douglas  sutherland  washington  d c  and political thriller  but  the sentinel  really hits a low  it s like they had a great idea up front  signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest  and i wish i could blame it on yet another bland performance from basinger  not only do i feel she s one of the worst actors in hollywood  but i m still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one  and definitely the only bad actor in the film  to win an acting oscar for  l a  confidential  but she wasn t the only problem  sutherland  who i love as jack bauer on   once again plays
jack  i miss his old  a time to kill  or  a few good men  days  douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in  plot  someone  some secret service traitor  wants the president dead and douglas is  haphazardly  being framed  will someone believe him  actually  no spoiler here  as quickly as they came up with that subplot half way through  it s over before you know it  and why did someone s  want the president dead  is that to be revealed in the sequel  too many plot holes  too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable  the sentinel  is  if you only see one movie a year  you may not know who the mole is  but anyone who s familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one  law   order  episode you ll know in the first few frames  was it terrible  not really  the cinematography was good  and despite sutherland playing jack again  he s still got it
