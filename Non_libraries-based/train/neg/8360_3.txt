what s to like about this movie   it is in colour    it has some impressive underwater photography    it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times    so   out of     sometimes the music is speeded up  especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in    sometimes it is slowed  as if to convey to the audience it s about to be time for sympathy    as another one bites the dust  as if in a  spagetti western  this has much similarity to    it s not that the italians can t produce quality productions  there was a series of tv movies with a heading like  octopus  numbered about   to   screened on sbs tv in australia in the  s about mafia type conflicts  and they were excellent  but alas  you won t find it here   i assumed it was made about  s  sadly it was   years out of date  as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end    then there was the razor sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters    amidst it all  either in bar room brawl or in observing the latest sea side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark  the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern  as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone s character development    at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly  for his ex wife    but of course  even if the music fails to awaken our realisation  we have the sinister sound in the baddies  voices  as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge    and near the end  someone thought of a twist  just when we thought it was all totally predictable  but stay tuned  folks  for you may find another twist  if you are watching closely  to  more or less  warm your heart    follow the advice of the hero  and have a few beers along the way  it ll make your viewing of  night of the sharks  more enjoyable    then you ll be ready for something like a   movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over
