spoilers herein  my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams  but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker  who was none other than australian kickboxing s favorite son  stan  the man  longinidis  the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone  because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than   or   feet away from him  now  his speech was full of the usual  if you fail to prepare  then prepare to fail  stuff  but there were various instances where i got really worked up  the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else  he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing  but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia s greatest kick boxer  he said that he wasn t a sell out  he was happy and a retiree  he wasn t ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing
 then he plugged his film  yes  you heard right  he plugged his new film  as he talked about it  he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it  and then he showed this shitty   minute clip of this vile film called  trojan warrior   this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight  for now   stan plays ajax  a kick boxing ex special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne  ajax s cousin  theo  arthur angel  recently sold out  well  at least stan didn t stray too far away from everything  to the feds  and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime  ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations  from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party  it s all pretty ridiculous  but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here  this man should never be handed a camera again    i ll admit  i was actually pumped to see this  i love action films  even if they re corny  and especially if it s set in my own backyard  but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word  go  and continued to do so after the words  for the love of god please make it stop  subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open  characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever  and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn t even remotely reflect stan s actual talent in kickboxing  the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous  dermot brereton  mark  chopper  read and greg matthews  the whole time you re sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background  too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities  remember those plot holes i told you about  ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up  wrongly accused for murdering his wife  now  we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film  and then leave it for buggery  this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up  then  get this  at the end  it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn t actually dead  but was sold into prostitution  do we see her  no  does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this  no  now that s a marriage    amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap  some website described this film as  
a cross between jackie chan   guy ritchie
  has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film  chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing
  well  anything  and guy ritchie is the crime film messiah  and you re comparing him to salik silverstein  this film is more like a mix between  pizza  and  enter the ninja    now  where do you thing the whole  trojan warrior  title comes from  ajax s fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior  no  the gangsters  unification to find theo  like that of the trojan empire  no  it s because
 wait for it
 theo carries a condom around with him  yes  that right  because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket  he is a trojan warrior    i had the displeasure of seeing  trojan warrior  on dvd  as well as it s  special  features      video clip of  chop chop  a rap song by mark  chopper  read  chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap  the funny thing was chopper just rapped for   seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster  using such words as  dis  and  dope  etc in their australian accents  face it people  rap was developed in the states  leave it there  the clip looked like something a channel   cameraman on ecstasy put together      bloopers  there was no real difference between these and the actual film      stan  the man  longinidis kickboxing featurette  this wasn t too bad  considering it was just   or   different fights shown from different angles  i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about   times in that   minute montage   i don t want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film  but  oh wait  i just did  my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy   or   copies of  trojan warrior  tape them together  and use it for a paperweight  because this movie is just that damn bad
