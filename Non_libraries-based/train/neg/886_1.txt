a few years back the same persons who created paris j taime  which was imperfect but very enjoyable   my rating was a   created this piece of garbage about new york city   in paris  i love you  j taime created a feeling for paris   it was made in many parts of beautiful paris   in this current film  i did not recognize new york city  i did not feel that i was in the city of my birth   new york does have   boroughs i saw no scenes in the bronx  or queens  there is one scene in brooklyn brighton beach  i saw no scenes in times square or greenwich village  no scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres  it does have a large cast most of the performers were not even stereotypes  they were caricatures of the lowest sort   the very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine new yorkers that we all know   love    a few of the films nominated for the  razzie  awards were far better   ratings     out of     points  out of   imdb    out of    in my way of thinking i think the title should have been  new york  i hate you
