and shot in vancouver with the  mountains  of the low country of south carolina visible in the background  for heaven s sake  they should have reset the location  there are no coastal mountains in south carolina  period   lame visuals  they should have been beautiful  and the story limped along   i really don t understand why it was such a hit as a book  although i have to admit it s one i haven t read as yet  usually i read the book and give the film a miss  there was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book  or even borrow it from the library   verdict  the mermaid chair seemed pretty shallow to moi
