i gave this movie a rating of    awful  the only reason that it should even get a   instead of a big   is ben kingsley  who always shines not matter what terrible material is thrown his way   mira sorvino is so out of her element here that as a viewer one simply can t get over the fact that she is even in such a piece   stupid  stupid story and horrible production  do not waste your video rental
