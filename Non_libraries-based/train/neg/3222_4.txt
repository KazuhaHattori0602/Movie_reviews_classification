i was very disappointed in this   film based on a bernard malamud story  this is basically a story of possible redemption  racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust   a black jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife  if morris mishkin  zero mostel  will only believe in the angel  belafonte  his wife fanny  ida kaminska  will recover  the problem is that morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that belafonte is an angel   when he believes it  fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and fanny suffers accordingly  it would have been very nice if there had been an english translation in the last scene when a dying fanny speaks to morris   jan kadar  who successfully directed miss kaminska in her oscar nominated brilliant performance in  s  the shop on main street  directs this film as well  kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn t convey the desperate situation that she faces  she keeps calling for ruthie  their daughter  who disobeyed them by marrying out of the jewish religion  for most of the film  she does not realize the angel s appearance in her apartment   the scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the angel s girl friend confronts belafonte in their apartment  is memorable but all too brief   we don t know why belafonte is in danger and why he has died   those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation
