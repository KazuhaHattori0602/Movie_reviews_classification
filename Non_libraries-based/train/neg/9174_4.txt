i usually like zombie movies  but this one was just plain bad   the good parts  girl swimming topless with thong bottoms  sonya salomaa s topless  and ona grauer s boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran   the bad part  too much video cuts  too much matrix slow motion  it drags the action  not enough blood and guts  bad acting  and no story  the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene  a total waste of   and time  i give it a   out of
