 when will i ever learn  the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane  please allow me to vent my spleen   i will admit  the setting  presumably new york city  has never been so downright ugly and unappealing  i am reminded that the  s was a bad decade for men s fashion and automobiles  and all the smoking  if the plan was to cheapen the characters  it succeeded   for a film to work  at least  in my simple estimation  there has to be at least one sympathetic character  only ned beaty came close  and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky  if a stray shot had struck mikey  well  it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most   i can t remember when i detested a film as strongly  i suppose i m a rube who doesn t dig  art  flicks  oh  well
