not much to say on this one  a plot you can pretty much peg  in the first   minutes  nothing overly wrong with this film  very little action for an action film  there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally  whether an action film is the right genre to do that with  i m still undecided  sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to  as it had little twists and a straightforward plot  i was probably guilty of that  so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better      but the best of my   out of  s
