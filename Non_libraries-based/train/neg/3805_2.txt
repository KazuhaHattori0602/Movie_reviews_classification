err this movie sucked  a lot   i have been reading some of the other reviews  apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything woody allen writes or stars in is automatically good   i have watched several of his films  in the vain hope that i m missing something  but no  they just suck  poorly written trash  the characters are all very stereotypical  not to mention rather stupid  the plot is i think it is supposed to be mysterious  not sure on that  mr  allen s character is woody allen  on any other film you have seen of his   if you are a fan of woody allen  go see this film  if you are under   don t bother   if you are a fan of woody allen and you are under  well  you are atypical  i don t know what to say
