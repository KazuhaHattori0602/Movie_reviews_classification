but this movie was a bore  the history part was fine but the musical part was not  not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard   if sweet jesus  was suppose to be comic relief it never work  if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one  the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene   hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie   the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical   shouldn t you be humming the songs after a musical  except for a few chirps  nothing else was worth the breath
