i just sat in the theater bored as hell  i wanted to leave halfway through the movie  the plot is simple   samoan guys wreck weddings  so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding  yawn   the thing that peeved me off the most was the so called crude jokes  they were highly unfunny  clich d and thrown in your face  to make you get into the already dull movie  the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot   all in all  one of the worse movies i ve seen of   unfunny  bad acting  just ugly   well thank god a friend shouted me    avoid
