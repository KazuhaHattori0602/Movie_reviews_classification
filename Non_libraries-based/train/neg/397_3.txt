okay  now what the hell is this supposed to be  is it a family fantasy movie to cash in further on the huge success of spielberg s  close encounters of the third kind  or a throwback to the glorious days of prehistoric epics such as  when dinosaurs ruled the earth  and  the lost world  perhaps it s an intellectual   philosophical masterpiece we all fail to comprehend  yes  that must be it  whatever it is  the creators of  the day time ended   good old john  bud  cardos of  kingdom of the spiders  and writer david schmoeller of  tourist trap  must have been sniffing quite a lot glue when they penned down the ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres  the story doesn t make the slightest bit of sense and the narrative structure is incoherent as hell but  hey  who cares as long as it s got papier m ch  dinosaurs  miniature spacecrafts  headache inducing light   laser shows and spontaneously combusting supernovas  the voice over introduction is practically inaudible  but no worries as it s all gibberish  did you know that the definition of  time  isn t what we all think it is  time doesn t necessarily pass by chronologically  it is one giant paradox  words that were spoken thousands of years ago are still floating around now and even things that will happen in the future are already surrounding us  i have absolutely no idea what all this means  but apparently it provides an easy excuse to gather tap dancing midget aliens and well mannered dinosaurs on screen together  i deliberately say well mannered dinosaurs  because at a certain point one of the prehistoric monsters politely knocks on the front door before menacing his targets  the crazy plot revolves on a family of weirdos living in their solar powered house in the middle of nowhere  grandpa is extremely annoying  the granddaughter even more  granny is a walking   talking advertisement billboard for plastic surgery  the youngest son strangely resembles prince valiant and the young mother is
