my sincere advice to all  don t watch the movie   don t even go near to the theater where this movie is being played  even a glimpse of it is bad for health  serious  no jokes  it s   am in the morning  and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe  four hours damn  i am proud that i survived after all of it  if this is called survival   i am highly frustrated  annoyed  disappointed  it was sheer waste of time  money went in drain  no plot  hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night  rubbish movie   happy republic day to one and all
