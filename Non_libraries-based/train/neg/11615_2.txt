though not a fan of sam rockwell  i was surprised when i saw his name in the credits in the opening of  joshua  heck  i wasn t even aware he was in  joshua  until i started the movie  so it goes without saying  i was watching the movie on the basis of the movie  not the leads  a sort of  rosemary s baby   the omen  or any other demonic kid movie  joshua  was billed  unfortunately  it fell flat  slow  incredibly slow  and flat  yet  i continued on to see how this would all resolve  hoping beyond belief  the ending climax would shed some light on the subject  okay  i admit  it did  a wee bit  but what a stale closing  and what a low low budget movie  or at least that s how they designed it  a person falls   you don t see the drop  you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood  a person gets hit by a cab   you don t see it  you see someone complaining  holding a bike up  i m not sure if this is called  style  or laziness or simply  lack of funds for special effects  we have a  rich  family with a crazy mom  a workaholic father attempting to balance everything  a kid   joshua  who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot  she cries as much as we see how many days she s alive   and what was that about  are there rats above or is it joshua  is his mother nuts  is joshua crazy  is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family  is he going to grow up to be michael myers  or does he drive his family to the brink  i don t think so  they were nuts prior  and no  so called  acting could make me believe otherwise  unfortunately  barely any questions were answered  barely any open doors shut  i m sure that might have been the idea  but for pete s sake  give me something  anything  there are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore  joshua s more like the mini me of the antichrist
