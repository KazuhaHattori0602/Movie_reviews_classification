don t waste   minutes of your time on  fast food  fast women  it s annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing  horrific acting  and even bad music  i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen  she needs the fast food   spend the   minutes you d devote to this turkey doing something more exciting like trimming your toenails  you d have more entertainment value   the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser  but she deserves much better than this tired script  it s as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie   viewer beware
