although there s flying guillotines as part of the title of this movie  it has no connections to the original flying guillotines   and its sequel flying guillotines ii   the two originals are masterpieces of kung fu movie and still stands out as a classic  this is a much inferior copy of the original  and even as a regular kung fu movie  it s below average   first of all  this movie doesn t have much acting  it s one senseless fight scene after another  and flying guillotine doesn t even play a major part in them  story is about some shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who ve took off with a sacred book  and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot  the same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them   there are four movies with flying guillotine as part of its title  this in my opinion is of least quality  the design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three   the movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production    best skip this and watch the two originals
