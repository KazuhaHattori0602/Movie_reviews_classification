there is a word for this sort of film  and that word is  drivel  it was drivel when it was a vhs rental  and it s drivel on satellite re runs now   it might fool you  because it has   moderately well known names in kistofferson and henriksen  reasonable soundtrack music  and nice monument valley scenery   it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot   if that s all you want from a movie  then maybe this will keep you happy   it s still drivel  though
