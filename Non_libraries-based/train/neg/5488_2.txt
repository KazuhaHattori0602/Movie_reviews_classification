why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film  has he really been that strapped for cash   the film isn t clear on what it wants to be about  grief  exotic places  ghosts  a vehicle for mr darcy  it s a muddled  muddy mess   there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good  in itself  and that italian has something to offer as a language   but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland   there are pointless episodes on the beach  in churches  on busy roads   but what it is all about  or why anybody should care simply isn t clear   there was also a yank woman in the film  it wasn t clear what here job was  but she seemed only to be there to make vapid  inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl  was it supposed to be about paedophillia   a pretty dreadful mess  all in all  i gave it   rather than   because it doesn t have the charm of an utterly ghastly film
