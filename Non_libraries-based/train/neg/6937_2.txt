the subject this latest adman turned movieman tries to tackle in his debut  ad venture is quite an age old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard   timeless romance  pun intended   however  the exploration  and exploitation for desi auds  falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to  pepper  spice and sugar  up the usual masala mix of b g score  dialog  dance  drama  etc creates a nice looking package with not much inside   in the first   minutes of the movie  the kitchen scene has been repeated at least   times  further repeats follow thru out the movie  after all the lead character s a cook  but therein lies les problemos   no story  hah  no wonder  someone forgot to write a script   amitabh puts in a cheeni jyada  more  amount of over acting  really when is this guy ever gonna stop  how many  somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile  something  timeless mind yes  but surely what about the not so ageless bod  and sole  sorry  soul  reasonably good acting by paresh rawal who has the only sensible role in the film  the director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new fangled discovery of a hot new idea  nowhere are we presented with any real life problems or issues such a pair might face  other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle  the sub plot of a little kid with cancer  the bachelor boy s first love  goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl s character   anyway  nice try but not quite there yet
