i saw the mst k version of  deathstalker iii  and loved the movie so much   even  unmystied    that i decided to watch the entire series of  deathstalker  films  i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh   nothing about  deathstalker i  was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and regretful that i had bought it  too much ugliness and nudity  i guess either  ds   was a much cleaner production or mst k really edited a lot because i expected something similar  i e  stupid and carefree and simple  i was wrong  even at   it seemed a waste of money  i didn t even open  ds   as i will return it tomorrow  now i ll probably just throw away this dvd as i can t return it and no one wants it   including myself  so really  don t bother with this one  even the nudity  lots of it  btw  is uninspiring and icky
