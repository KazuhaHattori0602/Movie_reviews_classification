good lord   and that coming from an atheist  this  movie  is bad    much has already been said by the reviewers before  the ones who rated this piece   and below  to which i fully agree  i just like to add a few things    among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products  got chopped up by an axe  raped by a broomstick  had their balls blown away   the ex boyfriend suffers the worst torture while having to listen to the girl s endless and pointless babble at the kitchen table  as do we  but at least we have the mercy of the mute button   had the director cut out the point  and endless graveyard and inverted scenes  our suffering would have been over after   minutes   the only things that made this flick at least somewhat bearable are emily haack s tits  one point   forget it  don t buy it  don t waste your time  and your sanity  my brain is so fried after watching this i feel the urgent need to watch  and suffer   scrapbook  right now
