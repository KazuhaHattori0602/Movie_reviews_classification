i rented this film on netflix after it won all the oscars  to see if it was really that good   the hurt locker is a very realistic portrayal  for the most part  of a group of soldier s rotation in iraq  the film centers around will james  a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks  and defusing bombs   where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the plot and direction of the movie  this film has no clear plot unlike other films such as black hawk down  what this film tries to do is focus more on the characters  and their different attitudes about the war  bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters  but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag  hurt locker is   minutes long  yet it feels like a   hour movie   one scene in the movie that was particularly awful  and ruined the films perfect credibility  was the sniping scene halfway through the movie  it was both unrealistic  and very long   overall  i thought this film was okay  but the reason i gave it a   instead of a   was because it was a major letdown for winning best picture at the oscars  i felt like this film could have been so much better considering saving private ryan lost best picture  but was much better than this film  another notable mention is black hawk down which only won   oscars  i honestly do not know how this won best picture   if you are looking for an action packed war flick  rent black hawk down  this film will be forgotten in a year or two
