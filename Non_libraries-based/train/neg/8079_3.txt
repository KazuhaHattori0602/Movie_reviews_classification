yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can   boring direction and performances  with the exception of the lovely annabel schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material  and the ever earnest charlton heston  earn the rating of a real stinker   it s amazing to watch heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is  he even plays in a sub plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie  the way they ended up resolving it was that they didn t  it simply falls off the end   really  don t waste your time on this one
