kareena kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm   akshay kumar   anil kapoor   maybe saif   kareena kapoor in a bikini   good banner   kareena kapoor in a bikini   not one good reason not to see this movie   or so i thought  didnt these people make jbj   why o why did i forget that   for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn t that bad   there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch   kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way   akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be   anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny  you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him   saif is sidey ala main khiladi  once again   there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles  and a few goosebumps during the kareena saif love story  kareena in the rain  behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm   but mostly this half promises more than it delivers   which makes the second half all the more unbearable   there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come   instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words   saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick   suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic  you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to big for her body   only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation   anil kapoor and his sidekicks get on your nerves   akshay kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while   all the while you are subjected to one absurdity after the other   why  what  when  where  what have i done to deserve this   a collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half  which were ordinary even without the movie around it   cannot relieve the trauma anymore   conclusion   this movie starts of as a buzz which you feel could even turn out to a high but ends up slowly moving towards a headache and then rapidly turns into a full blown migraine attack   please don t watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest    s cast  akshay kumar  first half    s what  when  how  who to much confusion need a book to fill this    s cast  the whole second half  need many pages to fill this   total    im trying to avoid the  s and  s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is
