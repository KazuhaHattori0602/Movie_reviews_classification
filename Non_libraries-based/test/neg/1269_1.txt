i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television  and sorely disappointed at the end result   the only  amazing  thing was the wall crawling  despite the visibility of the cable  i didn t think nick hammond was peter parker  and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit  you could tell they were two different actors   granted  i can also spot in the modern spider man movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi  but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi  still  the  s version could have been better despite lack of special fx   the webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them  and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in  hello  he s the web slinger people   sorry  didn t mean to get so worked up  but our beloved wall crawler deserved better
