it s strange what fate does to some people  while looking in the discount bin at a dvd retailer  i came across a copy of deadly instincts  being a collector of any film that is either sci fi  horror or featuring alien monsters  i decided to buy it  not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars   a bargain  believe me  after viewing it  i came to the opinion that it was nothing special  but after doing some research on the internet  i discovered that the film was actually called breeders   was a remake of the tim kincaid horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid s  which i ve already seen  my appreciation of  deadly instincts  grew following that discovery   a meteorite crashes on the lawn next to a private girls  college  the sole teacher there  ashley  played by todd jensen   that s right  the guy who gets turned into a cyborg in the cult flick cyborg cop four years earlier  notices that some of the students are beginning to disappear  while encountering a black haired woman with a scarred face   wearing a kinky leather outfit  his investigation reveals that an alien creature had hitched a ride on the meteorite   had come to earth to breed using the local womenfolk  along with a local detective who believes him to be responsible for the disappearances  ashley tries to stop the monster   the original breeders  directed by tim kincaid  who would leave the genre to make gay porn  was a sci fi   horror film which was actually a thinly veiled soft core porn film designed to take skin flicks to genre fans  it is  in my belief  one of the worst films made in the  s  why anyone would want to remake it is quite a mystery   this remake is actually a better effort than its low budget source  the film  which takes the basic concept of an alien monster trying to interbreed with human women  eliminates any pornographic elements  in fact  the film is actually very tame  there are no sex scenes  no nudity  even during the shower scene  swearing   violence are kept to a minimal level   there is no gore  which may cheat gorehounds  this makes the remake a film safe for the whole family  that is if the kids aren t scared by alien monsters  which brings me to the film s m   rating  which seems a bit much   tameness of subject matter aside  the film does have some faults  the script  while featuring some good characterizations  has a number of holes so big you can crash a meteor through   what  you re mad at me for that  come on  this review needed a bad pun so it will remain interesting   anyway  the film s setting is one problem the script failed to fix   the film is set in boston but the buildings don t look like they belong in boston  something about the architecture ain t right  another thing is the college itself  with a rather large building housing about twenty students  all female  of course    only having one class   art  the only teacher there has a relationship with a student   so does the janitor  which somehow escapes the attention of the principal  not to mention the cops  who are so one dimensional   stupid  that the real boston pd would have a good case if they ever decided to sue  oh    the meteor
 well the chance that a meteor which is sent from saturn  check the opening credits  reaches earth with no onboard propulsion is astronomical  that doesn t include the chances that any passengers in the meteor will survive the landing   as far as the acting goes  todd jensen gives a dependable performance as the heroic teacher while the late kadamba simmons  who was murdered by her boyfriend shortly before the film came out  cuts a striking figure in that leather outfit  as well as proving she can act  the visual effects are run of the mill  with credits due to the filmmakers for bringing us a cool looking monster
