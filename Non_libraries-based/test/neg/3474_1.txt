perhaps  we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen  perhaps  we expect too much from these films  however  if we  as viewers  are offered far too little  what happens then    that is what i thought after seeing imperium   nerone by paul marcus  a part of the production series on the roman empire  augustus by roger young  the first imperium movie  included at least peter o toole but what does this movie include   hardly anything accurate  the historical errors are so serious that the movie changes facts and constitutes rather a distorted image of the roman empire than the true history  throughout the movie  we see nero young  young man during the allegedly long reign of caligula  young man during the reign of claudius and finally during his own  historically   year long  reign  and he dies the same  according to the movie  nero  born during the reign of tiberius  lives for more than   years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies  continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie  which makes it hardly logical  not to say reliable  nero loses his father  is raised by slaves  at that time  his mother  agrippina  is exiled by caligula  later  however  she suddenly marries emperor claudius who already has big children with freshly married to him messalina  at these moments of the movie  we see acte  rike schmid  nero s mistress  all right  it is historically  accurate  yet  no source proves that she played such a decisive role in the rise of christianity in rome  in the film  she is not only a devoted christian but even a witness of st paul s miracle  he brings a young girl marzia back to life  besides  there was  historically  nothing like nero seen on the court of caligula since nero was born in caligula s   year long reign  a d    i understand that movies may change something but such an error makes the script absolutely unreliable  and many  many other shortcomings concerning content that are hard to enumerate but after   minutes of watching this film  i doubted whether i was watching a historical movie or a total fantasy   as for its artistic features which supply us with entertainment  they are equally lame as the history here is  the performances are artificial  the cast simply have beautiful faces but weak acting abilities  perhaps  i am too much attached to peter ustinov or charles laughton in the lead  but hans matheson does not fit as nero at all  he could have some of the good moments as an actor but never as the infamous roman emperor  is he an artist who burns rome for a song  is he a cynic who disguises the love to his relatives  is he a cruel ruler who sacrifices the lives of thousands of innocent people for the sake of  alleged justice  none of these  he is just a young man who does not know how to rule and  in the long run  begins to release the fire burning within himself  john simm is out of place in this film as caligula and absolutely inferior to other portrayals of the character  elisa tovati is only sexy as poppaea  yet she could have been much much better  the costumes are inaccurate and the sets do not amaze  low budget results in low effects and  consequently  low entertainment   but what made me most angry in this movie and  as a result  i give it   are some moments that are absolutely unacceptable     the death of poppaea and st paul s talk with nero at her dead body      claudius  mention of the current conquest of britannia on the feast and soon his death  he conquered britannia while messalina was his wife much before his death      tigellinus killing agrippina  laura morante  nero s mother      nero s arguments in the speech to the senators      finally  nero s death   a calm day at the lake and an indifferent suicide that leads to a moral said by acte  let us forgive him   all in all  this film is a waste of time and is absolutely unneeded as yet another production concerning the roman empire  it s better to make one good film in   years than ten minor little ones in   years      should not have been made at all
