very resistible but ultimately harmless film version of the children s literary classic which incorporates an animated portion in the style of mary poppins   and bedknobs and broomsticks   the human cast is very distinguished   james mason  billie whitelaw  david tomlinson  joan greenwood  bernard cribbins   but their roles range from the miscast  a   year old mason as a thieving chimney sweep  to the inconsequential  greenwood as a befuddled aristocrat  to the bizarre  whitelaw plays several  exotic  characters   including a circus performer  an old hag  a maid and a fairy   for no apparent reason   the animated segment of the film  handled by a group of east european animators  is hardly inspired but mildly enjoyable in itself and  as usual  with this type of thing  there is an assortment of songs one has to put up with  one of which in particular is reprised far too often for its own good  the film was directed by noted character actor jeffries who had previously directed  far more successfully  other children s films namely the railway children   and the amazing mr  blunden   which i ve yet to watch myself but which was released some time ago on r  dvd by anchor bay uk
