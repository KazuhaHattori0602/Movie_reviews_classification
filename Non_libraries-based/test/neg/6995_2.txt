the film listed here as having been made in   is not the film which is available from something weird video in their  driver s ed scare films vol    for one thing the   version is in color  swv has on this disc an earlier version   of the film made in b w for wlwt television channel   in cincinnati  either way this film is notorious  however  unlike most other driver s ed films  this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public  thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down  it s still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent  i live in the cincinnati area and i remember this thing being shown every year around prom time on channel   if you re looking for one film that demonstrates the tone of this uniquely american film phenomenon   the last prom  is pretty typical   morose  hyperbolic  extremely didactic  heavy on melodrama  whether it really affected any teenager s driving at all is anyone s guess
