ok  ill be brief  this film wasn t just bad it was very very bad  with line s like   if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh t on your shoes  you know your in hideous film territory  after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family  it gave me such a vast feeling of self loathing i wanted to do murder  don t watch this film  i will kill again  but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts   fortunately there is a flipside  its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierra   unfortunately it ends up trashed on its roof    ps  worse than the marksman
