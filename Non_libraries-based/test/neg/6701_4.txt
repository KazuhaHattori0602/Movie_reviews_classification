last night  i attended a screening of badland with my cousin  we were kind of excited to learn once we got there that the director writer  the producer  his wife  and several cast members were also in attendance and that there would be a discussion and q a after the movie  but once the movie was over and the credits started rolling  and the film really was not edited well enough and is too long  my cousin and i  without consulting each other  immediately got up and left  we found out once we started talking outside that we were both feeling so angry that not only did we not want to stay for the discussion  we couldn t even look at the cast and crew who had been standing near the exit and who we walked right by as we left   i have figured out that the roots of my anger were planted during the scene in which jerry slices his daughter celina s palm with a big knife so that her blood could be used to leave a fake trail  it was unavoidable to connect in my mind the physical pain he inflicted on her body with the emotional pain he inflicted on her spirit by murdering her mother and two brothers in her presence  sparing her  and taking her with him when he fled  i ve sliced my palm before  accidentally  even a fairly superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive  and it is very slow to heal if you don t keep it immobile because you just keep opening it up trying to go about your life  but after a very short time with only a narrow strip of cloth tied clumsily around her palm and one scene with a big band aid  it was as if she d never been cut  my anger reached its peak i won t spoil this moment for you in celina s final scene   i got angry because celina is by far the most sympathetic character in the film  the actress portraying her is a good one  i was and you can t tell me a good screenwriter wouldn t know this immersed in feeling both her physical and emotional pain  and the screenwriter  by treating celina s emotional pain so cavalierly and with such disrespect  also treated me  the audience member  cavalierly and with utter disrespect   sure  the script has moments of tears for celina  and some dialogue that tells us she s hurting  somewhere  somehow  but by this time  we the audience are feeling so manipulated that we ve shut down  the manipulation starts very early on in this movie  when jerry s family s dialogue spells out for the audience that jerry had psychiatric problems  rule one  screenwriters  give your audience some credit  let them do a good bit of the creative work on their own  tell the story  don t explain to us everything we re supposed to think and feel  we don t like it   my cousin also knew she was having trouble with the movie early on  dialogue wise  when jerry and his wife had little to say to each other besides f  this  f  that  f  you  some couples do indeed find themselves in relationships so bad that the f bomb ends up being every other word out of their mouths  but it s like watching comedians who curse a lot  some of them are really funny  the cursing is ancillary  but some of them substitute cursing for humor  and this screenwriter  to carry the metaphor to its conclusion  is no chris rock   this husband and wife team bravely chose to tackle an awfully complex story with awfully complex characters  but they seem not to have realized that the meaning of a story  especially a complex one  will vary for each member of the audience  successful storytelling requires paying attention to important factual details  not working desperately to interpret the meaning of the story for the whole audience   i worked with vietnam veterans for five years  i ve heard more stories than most  and i m always happy to see films released that bring their stories to a broader audience  it s important  on all kinds of different levels  that we hear them  but i am less than thrilled that this storyteller decided before the film even began what jerry s story meant and proceeded to spell it out for us with a very heavy hand  next time  pay more attention to the details
