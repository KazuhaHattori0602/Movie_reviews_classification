rozema s   adaptation of mansfield park is far superior to this ostensibly slightly more faithful film  the   film is reviled by many austen purists  but i admire the job rozema did in making mansfield park her own  it may not be strictly jane austen s mansfield park  but at least it was well written  beautifully shot  and well acted by a superior cast  i don t see how austen purists can be any happier with this   version from itv  and rebroadcast on masterpiece theatre pbs  the screenplay is shoddily pasted together and dumbed down to boot  the production values are lackluster  and the cast  apart from jemma redgrave and blake ritson  are largely guilty of bad acting  i can t think of a worst miscast than billie piper as fanny price  her look was all wrong  bleached hair and dark brows  and her talent simply wasn t suited to the material  sir thomas looked constipated the whole time  michelle ryan as mariah was on autopilot  as were the actors who portrayed the crawfords  when i think how superior alessandro nivola and embeth davidtz were in the   version  i just kinda shake my head   i haven t seen the   version  so i can t comment on it  but i d advise anyone who s curious to give the   version a chance  read the novel before or after and make up your own mind
