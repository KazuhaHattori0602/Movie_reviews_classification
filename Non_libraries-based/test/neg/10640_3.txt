 spoilers  i sometimes wonder what makes sequel makers think that they have to explain  and therefore destroy  the mysteries behind iconic horror films  the original  hellraiser  of   was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the scariest films ever made  the   sequel  hellbound  was also a fantastic horror film  though i personally didn t like how the viewer got background information on the cenobites  some of the all time creepiest horror villains in the original  the third part   hell on earth    was already quite a mess  whose makers obviously thought it necessary to add a dose of humor to the formerly incomparably creepy lead cenobite pinhead  a typical  s stupidity  and therefore destroyed most of his scariness  this fourth part  hellraiser  bloodline    is slightly more atmospheric than the third one  but it lowers this quality by inventing even more silly and completely unnecessary  background information  about the cenobites and the opening of the gates to hell   seriously   did we need to know how the mysterious puzzle boxes that open the gates to hell are being made  i think not  and that is not the only mystery about the cenobites that is stupidly destroyed in this film  the setting of  bloodline  goes back and forth in three different periods  the film begins in a  nd century space station  when scientist dr  merchant  bruce ramsay  attempts to close the gates to hell forever  when government soldiers disrupt his mission he has to explain his reasons  in  th century paris  merchant s ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box by an aristocrat obsessed with the occult  an evoked demon  the princess of hell  took over the body of the beautiful angelique  valentina vargas  since the only person capable of destroying the gateway to hell is the one who built it  the bloodline of the toymaker would be cursed and his ancestors infested by cenobites throughout the ages  the film  which takes place in the  th century  the present  and the  nd century  really is quite a mess  i admit that the part set in the  th century has a creepy atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film  but its also its smallest part  the parts set in the present and in the future are quite weak  and filled with stupid and unworthy elements  the film s undoubtedly strong points are the terrific make up and gore effects  the absolutely ravishing valentina varagas as the she demon  and pinhead  doug bradley  who  in spite of having lost some of his creepiness  still is a menacing villain  it is an almost offensive idea for  hellraiser  fans  however  that pinhead is supposed be defeated by a ridiculous light show  overall   bloodline  is not a complete disaster  but it sure is an unworthy sequel to a series that began so brilliantly  even director kevin yagher was obviously embarrassed about it  as he preferred to be credited as alan smithee  overall  this is only recommendable to hardcore pinhead fanatics  and most of them are probably going to be angered by another diminution of their favorite demon s creepiness  all others are well advised to stick with the brilliant first  and excellent second part of the  hellraiser  franchise and skip all the others  the makeup effects in  bloodline  are creepy as hell  but almost everything else is disappointing  my rating
