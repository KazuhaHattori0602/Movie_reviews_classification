there are just so many things wrong with this movie   jeff bridges weird accent   rita s ability to crack the password code   the entire script   the ending   esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher  j   r laugh and say  we don t drink coffee anymore  well  why did they order it then  they obviously did  if they didn t and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees   total tosh
