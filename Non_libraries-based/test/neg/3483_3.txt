this movie is one big stereotype  the acting  except philbin   harrison  is awful and the horrid script only make things worse  i must agree with another review that the  local  characters sound ridiculous as a matter of fact so do the  caucasian  characters    stars out of   for  philbin  harrison  surf scenes    out of   watch  aloha summer    and or  beyond paradise  for hawaii done right  especially bp which i found to be entertaining and brilliant
