wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  wait  what  this movie is terrible  absolutely terrible    the only reason kiefer sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to kiefer fans  only to have their hearts broken  he kills one guy  gets shot  and dies before half the movie is over  not to mention he was only in the first   min and then disappeared until the point which he died why put him on the cover if his character blows    where are the epic battle scenes promised in the preview on the back cover    it was way too confusing  i mean whats up with the girl  she had to narrate the movie to try to get our attention  she failed    if kiefer dies in a movie  it fails  now i am going to go watch   this movie fails
