if it had not been for christopher guest s hilarious role  i would have stopped watching this movie after   minutes  the jokes were flat  the movie choppy and slow paced  certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch  but guest s character kept me laughing so i stuck with it   i do feel there are much better choices out there
