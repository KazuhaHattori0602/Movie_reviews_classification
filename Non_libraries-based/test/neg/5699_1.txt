i rented this movie because i love kristanna loken and i ve watched her on many tv shows and since she s having her   minutes of fame nowadays with her new t  movie i wanted to check out what other movies she has been in   she s just ok in terms of acting  not good and not bad either  she makes up for everything by being extremely gorgeous  yummmmm  rodney rowland was quite a surprise as the hero  he provided the only solid good acting in the movie  he s a very good actor and should probably be an action star   besides kristanna being ok and rodney being really good everything else about this movie is garbage in its purest form   a computer hacker hacks into the system of a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant   or something  and of course there are the heroes who stand in his way and ruin his game   this is one of the worst scripts i have ever seen and no wonder it was a low budget flick   what s shocking is that this movie was made in   and it has way too many similarities to the september  th tragedies   why do they make movies like this in the first place   panic     one star  a waste of too good actors   also a waste of time   also known as air panic
