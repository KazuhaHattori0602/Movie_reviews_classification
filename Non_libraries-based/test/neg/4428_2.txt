director lo wei was known to read the racing papers and take naps on the set   tells us something about his  approach to film making  huh  the reviews i ve read fall into two categories    this is a film so bad it is funny  or   this is a film so bad it is boring   so let s get to the point we all agree on   this film is really bad   i vote for category   the story is almost incomprehensibly complex  and it is further shredded and twisted by the remarkably poor camera work and editing  yet lo wei was so in love with it that he slows the pacing so we can all have a long look at it  whether we want to or not   maybe lo wei was upset the day  or two  this film was made   he just wanted to make everybody suffer  cast  crew and audiences alike   spare yourself the agony
