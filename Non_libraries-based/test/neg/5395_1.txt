i got this in the horror six pack from echo bridge home entertainment  this one is not the worst movie ever made  but it still sucks  in fact  this movie sucked so hard  i don t know how i m gonna write this review  especially since   i popped it out of the dvd player because i couldn t even watch another second and   hurricane friggin  ike is coming and god knows how long  til it take for me to get this review done    the movie starts off with a scientist and his wife  the scientist receives a valuable artifact and examines it when this supposedly urban legend known as the skeleton man kills him  and later on his wife  then    i m sorry  but there s really not much else i can say about this pos except don t bother  i m currently using the disc as a coaster  and if you see this  you might want to do the same  casper van dien and michael rooker must have needed cash badly    ps  i ll pretty much be reviewing the movies in the boxset and might do a new review on ghoulies iv
