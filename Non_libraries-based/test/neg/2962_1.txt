this film was produced by producers releasing corp   prc  among the so called  poverty row  film studios of the  s and  s  so you can imagine how little money was spent making it   the music is forgettable  cast member gerra young does exhibit an operatic quality voice  but is sort of a discount deanna durbin  the imdb database doesn t show any other film appearances for her  so let s hope she was able to move on to some kind of position in grand opera   the opening credits for the print recently broadcast by turner classic movies indicates this film has been preserved by the national film museum  this immediately begs the question why    are their resources so plentiful that they can afford to preserve junk  some low budget or b musicals of that era have redeeming features which make them worthwhile  this film has none   in my opinion  skip this movie  it really wastes an hour of your time
