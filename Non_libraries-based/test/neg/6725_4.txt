bad acting  yes  but it was not a surprise  stupid story  yes  so what   but why  tell me  mr director  why all that slow motion crap  fight scenes were bad  really bad  because of slow motion and bad cutting  not because of seagal    what if i just speed this up for   seconds and then slow down those next   seconds and then  maybe i need to flip the coin to decide  what were you thinking  mr director
