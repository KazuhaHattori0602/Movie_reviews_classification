this is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen   it has no good features at all   it looked as if it was made in about   minutes with the other time filled with title graphics   the lead male transformed from deaths door to superman   eh you what  other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting   i left the cinema feeling cheated   needless to say i could not reccoemnd this film to anyone
