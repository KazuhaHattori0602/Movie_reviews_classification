plot     a chair from ebay    random people    random people talk   dude  it s right     i m feeling it   lets get married now     if you are a  hippie  then you will love this movie   you must be high or drunk  otherwise you will question your life watching this junk   this movie was clearly not thought out from the beginning to the end  and the other comments are probably the crew padding the reviews  if this wasn t aimed at my demographic  i don t know what it is aimed for  i found the plot everyday boring  it s something that i would do  and trust me it s not worth filming  going on a roadtrip and filming half of the silence does not make a movie
