adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by hollywood for his softball  user friendly movie making techniques  tim burton tipped the scales too far in formula s favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend  sleepy hollow  following the quest of ichabod crane   played by johnny depp  delivering this dreary film s only shining point   to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town s seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman  the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable  contrived as a children s bedtime story  humdrum character introduction is laced with intended upon exciting non engaging chase scenes which  with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives  produce about as much fright and thrill as the nightmare before christmas   toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide eyed  big busted blonde love interest  christina reechi  and burton has himself a movie that takes the age old legend of sleepy hollow and succeeded in making it like a disney movie without the charm or captivation  dialog was choppy and ridiculous  severed heads were aplenty  and there were enough plot revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of james bond  even with the backing of emmanuel lubezki  the most sought after cinematographer in hollywood today  the wonderful acting of depp and burton s astounding name recognition  sleepy hollow is nothing to lose your head over
