this movie was really bad  plain and simple  how a movie like this gets wide release is a wonder to me   it s a decent idea  but it just didn t flesh out  edward burns is a decent actor though  i liked his small role in saving private ryan   let s get down to the big issue here   the visuals were so incredibly bad  i thought i was watching an old  dinosaurs in  d  cdrom point and click adventure demo on windows   i mean  i ve seen cut scenes in console games from pre  that have better looking dinosaurs than this  i mean  heck  the original tomb raider t rex looked better than this one   the lizard monkeys were laughable  i thought they were some sort of ripoff creation from  killer instinct  i ve seen better sock puppet monsters now that i think about it   you know  there s a ton of made for tv movies that are better than this  how does a gem like scifi channels  the shining  get such a small audience  but this load of  cgi  easy to make   kidz  gets put out in the open  i don t care if it s a ray bradbury story  lameeeee
