how did so many talented or at least charismatic actors wind up in this baloney  nothing is very good about this movie but the worst things probably are the screenplay and the directing   apparently this is director damian niemans heart piece as he s both written and directed it  and acted in as well  he s a card magician himself and seems to have named characters in homage of other famous magicians  this was his first feature film as far as i know  and chances are it s his last   it s hard to point to exactly what makes it so poor   but i d say the story and character s are not believable  the screenplay  and the directing doesn t give it any boost  the director  plus   the poker scenes are bad in the worst hollywood manner  super hands  hollywood rules  the supposed twists in the movie are either totally predictable or totally unbelievable  they just end up tying a knot to a story that at best can be described as  a few decent scenes
