i enjoy watching robert forster  that was the main reason that i rented this movie  i also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no distractions    unfortunitaly i found the movie to be dull  i couldn t get interested in the characters  i couldn t get interested in the story which seemed to meander nowhere    after watching this movie for an hour i turned it off  i will rate the movie   out of   this falls well below the mandatory   rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch
