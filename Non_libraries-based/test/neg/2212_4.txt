yeah it may not be for adults  and some adults may find it stupid  but if you don t think about it it s really not that bad   the story has alvin and his gang  going across the world  in search of jewels for a bad person  and the misadventures that they come in contact with   so the animation is good  and the story is cute  and the songs are forgettable but it s a good movie   i give it a   out of   or   out of   stars
