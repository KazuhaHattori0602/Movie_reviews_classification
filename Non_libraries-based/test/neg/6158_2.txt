this film fails on many many levels  the script is the first failing  and as i understand it  if the script stinks  there s nothing that can fix that  the plot is boring  after the first   minutes  i m looking at the counter on the dvd saying to myself   how much longer  the cinematography is pretty awful  i m not sure how bad the transfer was to dvd  but it looked like a vhs copy  also  the sound was bad  i realize this isn t going to get remixed for   but yikes  it didn t even sound like it was in dolby stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film   slipstream was far too similar to both mad max and blade runner for comfort  because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog  it is extremely disappointing  if i recall  the pointer scene took place during the last   minutes  usually it should take place in the first   most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final   minutes   the film s music was excellent in parts  and then completely inappropriate in others  elmer bernstien did the scoring  but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in  other  stuff elsewhere as it doesn t match the overall good orchestral score  with some synthesizer music   there were great actors cast  bob peck  mark hamill  ben kingsley  bill paxton  and they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters   well  paxton s character was pretty stupid  and the whole movie was centered on him  i m not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film  again  a major flaw with the script   thank goodness i watched this from a mail order dvd service  and not the theater  overall a major disappointment for sci fi fans  or fans of paxton  or hamill    minutes of your life  you ll never get back
