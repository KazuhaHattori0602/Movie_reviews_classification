i watched this film a few nights ago and it was awful    awfully long   even though they managed to skip through the majority of his life   awfully boring   the parts they included were long winded  and for some reason the director chose to cut away from some of the action and left huge parts of the film unexplained    awfully inaccurate   the whole mystical  side to this film was a joke  and last time i checked ghengis khan wasn t exactly a nice guy    awfully acted   i found several of the characters hard to believe  they were very two dimensional and lacked and kind of depth    a saving grace of the film was the cinematography  that is why i gave this film a   star rating rather than the bare minimum  however  if you want to look at something pretty i would recommend buying a picture instead    all in all this film was an awful waste of my time and money  please do yourself a favour and give this mongolian turkey a miss
