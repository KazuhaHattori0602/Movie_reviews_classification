this film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the  very protracted  end    the plot is confused and laboured  the actors have a couldn t care less attitude  maybe they were paid in advance   bad move  or knew they weren t going to get paid  and the sets were featureless  boring and cheap   i fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last   minutes as i assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then  more unrecoverable life time wasted   if you must watch it  then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once  but maybe you ll need an antidepressant instead   sometimes it s good if celluloid degrades
