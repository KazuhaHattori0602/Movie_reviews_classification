this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of   hours of my life  from the opening   minutes  i was ready to leave  the cliches there slapping you in the face  and the plot was not only predictably stupid  but full of more holes than swiss cheese  i am considering suing for that lost   hours  and   along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film  the t rex s must be flipping in their graves  so to speak
