isn t it strange how crap movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like   boy  this is going to suck harder than few things have ever sucked before  it s pretty much impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high   or even remotely positive   expectations  as  house of the dead   is a sequel to something that is generally considered to be one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released  the abysmal reputation of the original actually turned out to be a great advantage for director michael hurst  as it was really easy to surpass the quality level of its predecessor  and exactly how embarrassing must this be for uwe boll  huh  having to acknowledge that a straight to video sequel without star power or promotional campaigns is much better than his own pretentious video game interpretation  in case anyone still doubts  no   house of the dead   dead aim  isn t a good horror movie at all but  yes  it s definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you re looking for an undemanding splatter film with loads of gory butchering  sleaze and stupid humor  there s no real connection with the events in the first film  another advantage  and this part two opens like a typically rancid sex comedy set in a college campus  the male fraternity club plans to attack a sorority house  inhabited exclusively by blond coeds with enormous breasts  but the party gets interrupted when an insane professor  sid haig  who runs his car over a girl and takes her back to his lab to turn her into a zombie  this is the beginning of a quickly spreading and deadly epidemic but  no worries  as the government is prepared and sends their best scientists   soldiers to the campus to search for survivors and to bring back blood samples for an antidote  hunting down zombies seems like the most common thing in the world for this squadron  they even named them hyper sapiens  but their constantly increasing amount eventually endangers the lives of the most hardened soldiers  director hurst thankfully found his inspiration in the more eminent classics of the genre  like james cameron s  aliens  and   of course   george a  romero s dead trilogy  particularly  day of the dead  he luckily also didn t made the same mistakes as uwe boll  who inserted footage of the actual video game in his movie  why  and  slightly  exaggerated with the use of cgi techniques  hotd   contains heavy images of violence  like chopped up female corpses and detailed amputations  but it never really becomes nauseating or shocking  naturally  there s isn t the slightest bit of suspense to enjoy and every dreadful horror clich  features here as well  the film is very enjoyable as long as story writer mark altman doesn t try to explain the origins of the zombie epidemics  they re walking corpses with their brains hanging out of their skulls  so we really don t need to know what caused their deaths  especially not when the explanations are given by a blond sorority slut who clearly hasn t got a clue what all the medical terms mean  just avoid getting bitten  sweetheart
