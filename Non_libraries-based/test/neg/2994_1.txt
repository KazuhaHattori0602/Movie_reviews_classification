i can t think of anything  i repeat  anything positive about this  movie  the whole   hour   minute movie could be shrunken into a short  minute movie  in most scenes  there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie  all you see is someone in the background walking around or watching tv with no specific subject or even talk what so ever  i just feel i ve wasted   minutes of my  my family s and my friends  weekend for nothing  if a movie is poorly made or the scenario isn t great that s whole another story  at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about distant  i just have to call it a  movie  because it was motion pictures recorded by a camera   if you haven t seen it  imagine a  min long movie based on two three lines of story  what will you end up with    of content and   of fillers  that s exactly how  distant  was at least for us  actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them  they barely talked or showed any special emotions  i picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what i read on the back of its cover  i m still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie
