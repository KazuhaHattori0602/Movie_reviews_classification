maybe james p  lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him   in  dreamland   however  he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director   there is absolutely nothing in this film  no story  no character building  no events  no atmosphere  no plot  no twists  no acting that deserves that name   in any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it  even a one minute one   it has nothing to do with any of david lynch s works   i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west   recommend it only to your worst enemies
