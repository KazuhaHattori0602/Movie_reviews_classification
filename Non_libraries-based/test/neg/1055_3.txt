  possable spoiler but probably not    the game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it  anymore  diddy is gone aswell   the  st donkey kong country was one of my two all time favorite  super nintendo games   the other being super mario world   the  nd donkey kong at least had diddy kong and good levels   although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times   however this one is the worst of the lot  it does not have the feel of  the original or  nd  the enemy s look stupid and the levels are  even worse  it does not look realistic anymore  i did not enjoy his game unlike the last two  the first had great  background music and the  nd was not bad but the music in this  game is horrible   it happens a lot these days that movies  shows and sometimes  video games that start out fantastic  end up with it being ruined by  a stupid sequel  i am sad to say i feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good  now that it has donkey kong    they should have left it at the original or maybe the  nd one
