predictable  cliche  unbelievable  boring what else can i say  it s only the caliber of the cast that saves any redeeming qualities of this bloated mess  oh yeah  and the entertaining end zone antics   but wait for the eleven o clock highlights   cause the outcome is as predictable as who s going to win the globetrotters washington generals matchup   i was well into the second act before i figured out these were supposed to be pro teams we were watching  all clad in vintage padres brown  and cameron diaz character s imitation of a youthful georgia frontiere was ill conceived on the page   not your fault  cameron  would you like to go to dinner   enough of this   i m only on a rant because i was looking forward to this film  rent the longest yard instead
