  while sporadically engrossing  including a few effectively tender moments  and humorous  the sledgehammer obvious satire  homecoming  hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling  with material like this  timing is everything  michael moore knew to release  fahrenheit   before the   elections  and the real tragedy of dante s film is that it didn t come out   years ago  when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further  in   mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling  or imperiled  as it did then   frankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence    and if you didn t notice  michael moore didn t exactly help to defeat bush   there was nothing engrossing about this film  i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was  it was painful to watch  if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit  sadly this has none  a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect  as they say  with friends like these who needs enemies
