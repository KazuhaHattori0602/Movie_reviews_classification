first  what is really great about this movie      ryan reynolds  great acting  there are very few actors i really like and for now he is one of them  he has an amazing skill to impersonate characters      the soundtrack  very good music played at the right time      the idea of a nine lost in his own world  incapable of leaving    still  i give it only a   out of   for certain flaws      horrible second part  it seems that the director was very eager to make something new  but despite of the efforts it was really boring     very annoying character melissa  i couldn t stand the scenes with her   i e  it was constantly annoying  she represents everything that is wrong with american woman      terrible explanation of the numbers  the director was so busy with character development  that he completely missed the point of a good story  excuse me koalas  brr  terrible   this movie had great potential  the filming is nicely done  the music is really good  but nothing more   see it only if you are a fan of ryan reynolds  or have a lot of time to spare
