this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers  if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days   melanie griffith took off her shirt  and in her pre enhancement surgery days  she really should have stayed dressed   jeff daniels was completely wasted  but fortunately for him and for us  he has gone on to much better things since this   this   this   well  heck  piece of garbage   strangely  all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things  including director jonathan demme  his work here was also wasted but deserving of a grudging admiration  i mean  anything not worth doing is not worth doing well  but he did it well  anyway   still  there was one bright  shining aspect  ray liotta  who is named way down the credit list  just absolutely stole everything  liotta was magnificently mesmerizing  hypnotic  enthralling   i saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new  in a friend s private theater  for some strange reason  my friend loved it  i sort of think it s because melanie griffith took off her shirt  and  really  honest  she shouldn t have  though he tried to claim it was other  more artistic  reasons   anyway  i thought even then  after his first scene  that ray liotta would become a major star  or at least a major  highly respected actor   despite the garbagey aspects of the garbagey script  the sheer ugliness of the whole story  liotta made it almost worth watching  in fact  it is worth seeing  once  just to see how far ray liotta has come  i mean  for one thing  his name is now usually listed at or near the top   even then  even in a pile of garbage  ray liotta shone like a diamond   just  if you do see this trash  be prepared to hold your nose  every major character is either amoral or immoral  terrible movie  terrible movie idea   added comment  too many people answer  was this comment helpful  with a  no  because they disagree with the expressed opinion  maybe imdb should ask that question instead   do you agree with these opinions
