i don t understand what the big hype was about this film  all the horror sites were saying that this movie had all the essentials of an  old american slasher  flick that it would satisfy your needs    even though this was similar to an old american slasher flick  my needs were still not satisfied   my big problem with this movie is that we are now in the  s  not the  s   s horror is the past and should stay in the past  horror movies have changed so much that older movies now look cheesy and unrealistic  even though they are fun to watch  they don t offer the same realistic blood thirsty gore that the recent films offer   hatchet is cheesy  unrealistic  and down right awful  if we wanted to watch an old american slasher flick  i can just go back to the friday the  th series  nightmare on elm street series  or the halloween series  i must admit  the movie is better than some of the horror movies being released but it is among the worst  the jokes are not funny and the actors are horrible   i would personally stay away from this movie and never look back
