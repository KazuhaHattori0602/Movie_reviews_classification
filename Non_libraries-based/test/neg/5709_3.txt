i can t really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie  a woman meets a man  he wants to play games  she too  but only until she realise what she s missing  she leaves  and that s it really  it took     weeks before elizabeth  kim basinger  left john  mickey rourke  she should have left him after   minutes and ended our misery
