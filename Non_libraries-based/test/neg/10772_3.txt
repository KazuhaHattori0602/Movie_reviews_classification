having read the books and seen the   anthony andrews jane  seymour version  i have to say that this is not good at all   according to the books  percy is supposed to be a seemingly  foppish aristocrat when he s being percy  and witty and clever  when he s being the pimpernel  but here he just looks bored as  percy and mean as the pimpernel  marguerite is supposed to be  the most beautiful woman in europe  not a tired and frumpy looking matron  she looks middle aged  probably due to  bad make up  richard e  grant has done much better things  and  elizabeth mcgovern s acting is uninspired and flat  the wit and  dash of the books and the andrews seymour film is here replaced  by brawn and flashy editing that just don t make the cut     i might add that to a person who hasn t seen any previous version  or read the book  it would probably look ok
