i am a chess player and i wanted to like this film  trouble is  the content could have been fitted in a  minute documentary   there were lots of shots of corridors being walked down and kasparov gazing out in the hall where he won the world championship  there were other shots of kasparov being walked round the site of the   match and being told where he sat and where deep blue was located  this just looked like filler   also  i didn t find it interesting to see in detail where deep blue was now and seeing an ibm techie trying  unsuccessfully to  open  it  what would we have seen of interest inside anyway   a little grandmaster   also  the recent match against karpov  i no longer follow professional chess enough to know when and where this was  it would have been nice to have been told  was this a one off  just for the money  was it part of the world championship cycle  what was the final score  the nub of the film was the play in game two  could would ibm let kasparov see  inside  the machine  that s where the focus should have been
