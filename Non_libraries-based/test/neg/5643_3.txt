i could not believe the original rating i found when i looked up this film    unfortunately it looks like i am not alone   the film  is slow and boring really  one of the sad things is that if the film had been given a realistic rating of around   or   then the expectation would not have been so high   unfortunately  this was not the case  so when watching the film  and seeing the poor story and acting  i am left giving it a   score   vinnie jones is superb in lock stock  and also snatch  and he plays a great hard man  however  he should stick to this role  its a bit like when stallone and schwarzenegger have done comedy films  they just don t work   neither can he play lead actor  he plays better as supporting or otherwise  when he plays lead  his acting talents are too  in view  and shown up as not really very good  mean machine is another good example of this
