i loved this movie   years ago when i was about   years old  my biggest mistake was to watch it again    years later  it s not the worst  i wanna be a pilot  movies ever  but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook them   queen s  one vision   along with the rest of the soundtrack  makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see    [ ]
