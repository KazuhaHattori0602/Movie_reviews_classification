 ing from the monster  there s a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert locations are effectively eerie  lance henriksen is adequate as always  even though this is yet another inferior production he stars  and giovanni ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in  for some reason  this anonymous  s thriller is also known as  the hills have eyes part   is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert  is it because wes craven was once again involved  as a producer this time  or maybe it s because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael berryman in the   original  who knows who cares  wes craven probably financed this project because his son co wrote the script and it s always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are  not recommended
