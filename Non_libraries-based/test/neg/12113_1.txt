i ll preface my review by stating that i am not a fan of the independent  straight to video  genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the  s  i don t own any  i ve never rented any  so i might lack the appreciation for these tongue in cheek  low budget stinkers that many other people have   i caught this movie on cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend  please don t ask me why i was watching cinemax late one saturday evening with a lady friend  we were bored with world championship poker  some atrociously bad acting courtesy of misty mundae  and i wish she wouldn t own up to being from illinois  as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here  caught our attention  now normally  the aim of some good soft core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood  some good sex  tongue in cheek humor  and who know what could happen  after about   minutes  and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim  my lady friend said  if you want to watch the rest of this fine  i am going to bed so i don t have to  please turn the volume off  here is what i gather from the plot  misty s character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don t come from her wrists  there is some sort of evil villainess involved  who didn t look particularly evil or sexy  spiderbabe saves the day  has sex  m j   who is male in this film  constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers  and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death   what was good about this film  it ended   what was bad about it  acting to make a third grade pageant look like oscar winners  a script turned out by people who i picture to be drunken  college aged sex perverts who wouldn t know what sex is if they took a class taught by dr  ruth  special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline  humor about as funny as
 well  i have yet to encounter anything that is lamer  the sex scenes  if we were watching a video  the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button  and the action scenes  some of my old atari vcs games had better choreography   now i know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it s inherent badness  companies like ei don t set out to make good movies  they have a niche and they target it  my experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience  but after my brief exposure to  spiderbabe  i for one can say i am not delving into that world again any time soon  maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this  they spend so much attention to making the films bad  that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well  they would turn out some very enjoyable  le bad  cinema  a la troma films in the  s  sorry folks  the spirit is there  but the effort isn t   though i have to admit that  alice in acidland  intrigues me
