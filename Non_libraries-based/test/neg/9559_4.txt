bugsy siegel was   when he went out to the west coast  in addition to his dreams about las vegas  he toyed with the idea of acting  he was a good looking guy and about   years younger than his pal george raft  so it wasn t such a crazy idea   warren beatty was   when he made this movie and despite the hair dye  he s too old for this part  beatty was miscast  bugsy should have been played by someone like alec baldwin  bugsy was a tough guy feared by his contemporaries  beatty just doesn t radiate menace   this was a vanity project for beatty  who hasn t come to terms with the fact that he s no longer a leading man   the other big annoying miscast is mantegna as george raft  raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms  none of which mantegna even attempts to match  you never once believe that mantegna came from the streets   warren beatty and robert redford have both been pretending to be younger for years by massive use of hair dye  and now it ll be a shock to suddenly go gray and play character parts
