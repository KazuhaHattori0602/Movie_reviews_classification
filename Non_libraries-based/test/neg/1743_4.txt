some janapese modern horror movies are very good  strong plot  scary moments  good acting  while others are just  unfortunately  uzumaki belongs to the latter camp   i will rate the movie based on   elements  plot  scary factor  and acting     plot   true to the name the movie  the plot moves in circle and never really explains itself  ok  the town is captivated by the spiral curse  but why  and why do people act so foolishly  there is a fleeting attempt to explain about what is happening by the reporter  unforutunately     scary factor   if this was meant to be a horror flick  it has failed miserably  i can t really remember one good scary scene with plenty of build up to it      acting   very monotonous  people walking around  saying meaningless phases  i can t really feel much empathy for our tragic heroes   all in all  there are much better modern japanese horror movies out there with coherent plot and strong characterization  don t bother wasting your time on this wannabe
