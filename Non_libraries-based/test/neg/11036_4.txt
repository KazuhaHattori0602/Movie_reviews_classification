a pretentious but   to varying degrees   watchable collection of mostly pointless  stories   but let s start from the top   kaurismaki  if one ever wondered what finnish love romance was like  perhaps this dull little oddity is some indication  subdued feelings  non emotions  apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from finland to siberia  i guess the sequel to this story will be  for our honeymoon we move from siberia to greenland  aki obviously had no clue what to write for this little movie  so he just made up some half assed non story  centering around a band he particularly likes  or maybe they re his friends  because we get to watch them and listen to their music more than the two principal characters   erice  first off  i ve never heard of this guy before   and now i know why  nice black white photography and pretty much nothing else   unless being bored silly can be considered an asset  but you d be surprised how many movie critics and film students love boredom in movies so i hotly recommend erice s  minute snooze fest to those two groups of humanoids   herzog  not a movie but probably a slice out of his documentaries about tribes in south america  this isn t a short film but a report  but considering how dull the first two entries were  herzog s bit is almost refreshing and does have some interesting moments  and if nothing else fits into the movie s pretentious  time  concept very neatly   jarmusch  as was to be almost expected  this once interesting film maker  with the brain of a peanut  a talented idiot savant  serves us yet another doze of pointlessness  he has become lazy and can t be bothered to write anything interesting  either for his own movies or a collection such as tmo  the only bright side in watching how a dumb veggie actress spends   minutes in a trailer is that she is played by the lovely chloe sevigny  otherwise  skip this nonsense  oh  and btw  i don t believe that any young actress listens to classical music  was jarmusch trying to be surreal by making chloe listen to that kind of music  does lindsey lohan perhaps listen to opera  maybe drew barrymore is a jazz fan  who am i to say they aren t   jim jarmusch is a moron  oh  right  i already mentioned that   wenders  here is the actual shock of the whole movie  wenders can actually make something good  everything else i ve seen from this overrated charlatan has so far been dull and pointless  however  this short little story is done with style    atypical  and is the best part of the movie  it leaves one wanting to see more of it  even though the story has a resolution   spike lee  oh  dear lord
 what can i say here  lee makes anyone seem talented by comparison  like herzog  he chooses not a story but submits a report   and a left wing political propaganda report at that  cnn  but in black and white  and one sided  of course  naturally   we wuz robbed  the retarded title of this little sleep inducer  is about how the poor  gullible and infinitely idealistic democrats wuz robbed by bush and his evil evil team of thieves  this is by far the dumbest and dullest entry in this movie  and i had to utilize the fast forward button so as not to doze off  spike lee truly is a product of affirmative action  god knows how many really talented  black  directors never had a chance to make movies because this pretentious and talentless little runt keeps getting opportunity after opportunity to make them  and he gets it wrong every time  now that does take some kind of talent  right    kaige  the chinese story has a solid premise  it s okay  nothing more   all in all  there are many and far better movies to spend your time on  but if your time isn t that valuable  as is apparently the case with my own  you can check this little film out    ten minutes sure can be an eternity in the hands of anti masters of cinema  time is precious  waste it on better movies    fedor miklowitz
