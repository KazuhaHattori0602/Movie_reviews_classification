talk about marketing  the poster home video cover of  the new twenty  broadcasts a half naked male in a  wolfe video  for those familiar with the gay themed movies   this broadcasts a  must see   i loved reading one reviewer  from another site  stating they had been  tricked  into seeing a  sodomite  movie  are you serious  the tagline itself as the word  gay  the lord gives you eyes  yet you cannot see
  that being said  despite the number of gay characters  stereotyped  no less  see  the lonely gay  the aids victim gay and the closeted gay  it s more about long term friendship and characters that grow apart  in fact  if anything  there s more  here s one for christians to complain about  heterosexual couples having sex outside of  gasp  marriage  not to mention backstabbing  drinking to excess and drug usage  i see this more of a made for tv logo or showtime movie than big screen effort  sure  i loved the cinematography  some of the actors could act and i always love seeing a big group of friends that actually act like they ve known each other for a million years  but we ve see this all before  nothing really  new  here  barely an original idea   hence bringing back the same  ole  i have aids  let s deal with that  for a good portion of the movie and boy  our friend has a serious drug problem  but let s not deal with that until it s almost too late  that s so  us   queer as folk  and  broken hearts club  respectfully  the film deals with a group of college buddies  now grown  in size not minds  who have to eventually grow up and each trying their best while failing  strangely  as in most of these independent movies  the most interesting  to me at least  was the heavier set one  ben  he stole each scene  but  again  there wasn t much to take
