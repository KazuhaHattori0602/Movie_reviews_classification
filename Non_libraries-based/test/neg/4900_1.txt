to start  i m not a person to rate movies that i haven t seen  nor am i a person that rates movies  s when they don t deserve it  this movie was really that bad  the basic plot was extremely formulaic  and while it wasn t great  the plot deserved about a   the part that really bothered me was anything referencing swimming in the film  i compiled a short list of things wrong with the swimming aspects of this film     no character development    no sense of time    completely inaccurate swimming scenes  which include  a  a team of six swimmer going to something called both  nationals  and  regional  with no mention of how they qualify  b  this same team going to whatever the hell this meet was without swimming a real meet at any point in the film  c  the rival program goes from being a high school to a club team back to a high school and then a club team again  d  in the scene where ellis is interviewing for a job the banners show high school state wins and placements at nationals  yet the team consists of anywhere from   to   swimmers depending on which of the   meets are happening  e  a team of   guys and a girl win nationals regions whatever  f  said girl wins a men s   butterfly event  g  in this race  said girl beats two guys from a team that the previous year was in the top   in the nation  h  the announcer changes a race from the   breast to the   breast back to the   again in the span on about   seconds  i  in the final relay  the  x  which is being swum in a   meter long course pool  one swimmer is seen doing two flip turns  j  in this same relay  the teams anchor swimmer freaks out and steps off the blocks  prompting an inspirational pep talk  which lasts for about two and a half minutes  or about   times as long as the leg would take at a national caliber meet  k  the movie begins in the month of july or august  assuming that ellis was applying before the school year started  and the pool was to be closed in   months  so assuming these things both hold true  the swimmers went from not being able to swim to winning nationals regional whatever  in less than two  as the pool had to be cleaned and the kids didn t start practicing for a while  l  i m sure there are a couple hundred more  i m just trying to block them out of my memory    throughout the film there is not a single mention of a swimmers time    if you re going to have a movie about swimming  it would be a good idea to hire extras that know how to swim well    the scene where the kid is kicked underwater is physically impossible   that being said  all the swimming scenes were way too slow  swimmers had horrible technique  and the idea of being able to qualify for a national meet within three months of learning to swim is just insulting to swimmers everywhere   ok  if you still don t believe me  let me say that this movie is one of the   worst films i have ever seen  and this is coming from the guy that owns gigli  soul plane  manos  the hands of fate  skullduggery  and any number of other total piece of crap that have been put on film  please don t go
