i remember when  the love machine  was first released to theaters  i was a mere   years old  too young to see the much ballyhooed motion picture release  but not too old to take my mom s paperback copy of the jacqueline susann novel to school and pore over the  naughty bits  with my schoolmates   though i m not sure what my problem was at such an early age  but i was very much into the book  i bought and wore an  ankh  ring just like on the paperback cover  and i remember the ads for the perfume   xanadu  that was cross promoted and featured clumsily in the film  despite such an interest i didn t actually see the film until several years later  i should have left things as they were    the love machine  is hands down the worst of the many bad films adapted from susann s novels which of course makes it the most fun to watch  its faults are many  from its hopscotching script that jumps choppily from one incident to another with nary a connecting thread  its dated  horny  brass instruments  i mean  music score of ersatz bacharach  the flat  first take performances  the boring sexuality  i ve never seen bathrobes featured so prominently in a movie before  it s like a fetish  whenever sex  nudity or something sleazy is called for  out pops somebody in a blue robe  very odd  that  and most certainly  the circus train of awful  s fashions that are on endless display  poor dyan cannon s performance  which is no great shakes anyway  but heads over the rest of the cast  is consistently undermined by the jaw dropping get ups she s called upon to wear  however  the film s chief liability is the stoic  stone like john philip law as  appropriately enough  robin stone  the object of every girl s  and one over the top flaming male photographer s  affection   law is just awful and performs as if he were pulled off the street  handed the pages of the script in hurry and told to give a cold reading on the spot  just lifeless  not only that  but he appears in desperate need of a blood transfusion or something  he looks wan and sickly throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his female costars  robin stone should be a hunk  not a hankie   for anyone finding the film hard going  it s rather slow by today s standards  i beg you to stick around for the climactic  fight scene  here ms  cannon  balancing   pounds of teased hair  finally abandons her heretofore starchy acting style and lets loose with that infectiously raucous laugh of hers  setting in motion a truly memorable free for all that should have become a cinema clip highlight by now  trying to rival  valley of the dolls s infamous wig down the toilet scene   the love machine  finally does something right   jacqueline susann s unique brand of trash is sorely missed  perhaps someone out there owns the rights to rona barrett s  the lovomaniacs  and will revive the genre
