i got to know  on back in the early  s via television and i loved it   what did you like about it   the cranky drawing style   the flawless artistic action involved   the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters   the whole layout of the surrounding future world   no matter what you loved about it   the aeon flux film of late   has nothing of that   karyn kusama  the so called  director  of the film  was hopelessly over strained with transporting the original content to a new film  if you  re not familiar with the original series  you won t understand anything during for the first  minutes of the film the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film   kusama s attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only a lame attempt to cover up her flaws as a storyteller   it s simply unworthy of the original  on concept   charlize theron might be an attractive woman  but she can t impersonate the  on character  although she was attached to strings doing action scenes  her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film  the result is a tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique   forget about all the rest  it s not worth talking about   i give  point for ms theron showing her boobs and  point for the nice architectural photography in the film  that s it
