boyle heights  los angeles  legendary south american goat sucking vampire  el chupacabra  is on the loose  feeding on anyone unlucky enough to cross its path  animal control officer navarro  eric alegria  and chupacabra expert author starlina divide  elina madison  attempt to track down the creature  but find their progress hampered by a pair of dumb cops  money hungry locals keen to capture the beast for a fat reward  and a couple of nefarious scientists who want the monster for their experiments   stinking higher than a two week old taco  el chupacabra is an incredibly bad horror movie that even fans of incredibly bad horror movies might struggle to sit through  with its dreadful script  awful direction  by not one  but two talentless hacks brennon jones and paul wynne  laughable dialogue  and some of the worst acting this side of a porn flick  i recommend this film about as much as i do drinking the tap water in mexico   as navarro and starlina proceed with their investigations  viewers are treated to some incredibly weak gore  the worst designed book jacket in history  the most unconvincing dead person i ve seen since the blinking corpse in dr  butcher md  and a high tech computerised security system consisting of a keyboard nailed to a post   to be fair  for a guy in a rubber suit  the monster itself is fairly creepy  hairy  with big claws  and a face like a particularly ugly bat  but its appearances are few and far between  with more screen time spent on the tedious trials and tribulations of whiney officer navarro than on the killer antics of the titular creature  just how many times is it necessary to see navarro handing in paperwork to his bitchy boss   if  like me  you make the mistake of wasting your hard earned cash on this dreadful latino bilge  in my case  it was a whole  p  consider using the disc as a coaster for your tequila rather than actually watching it
