in fact  everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped  dragged  and hung  if this is what great eugene o niell drama is like i never want to be victim to viewing it ever again  there are so many things wrong w  this feature where does one begin  first  elmer bernstein s bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character s motivations  second  these characters are not pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that i personally disliked every scene in which ives ate up the scenery  but that was the way his characters was written  to be disliked  w  loren it just never is made clear whether she s good or bad 
 and all her babbling about how she s going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives 
 well  i saw what was coming clearly  perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm up for norman bates  which he played two years later  even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end  hokey  third  this film is a studio sound stage production and it suffers because of it  the story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of  place  regarding the farm  which all the main leads are fighting over  as it is filmed there s no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound stage feel to it that isn t convincing  this is a really awful film
