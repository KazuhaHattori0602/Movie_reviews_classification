the film begins with a   minute explanation about the war  the human cyborgs  battles  history  and then dumps   actors into a gravel pit  they run around this gravel pit desert area for about an hour shooting at each other  that s it  must have cost about   to make  with change  avoid   marks out of ten  acting   sets   costumes   direction   production   titled intro    i think to improve this film would be to  lose the commentary   let the watcher decide what s going on  remove some of the awful cgi  add some techno rave music to it  they might just rescue it
