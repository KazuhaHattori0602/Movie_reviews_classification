while this is horribly dated  i must insist please  no remake  frankly  it just won t help  as there s nothing which could be added or changed  contemporarily  to make this cinematically better   the novel upon which this is based  was atmospheric  well written  truly spooky work  but on film  it just doesn t translate  most of king s written masterpieces fail to translate to film  i m not sure why this is  but when you view this work  if you view it  you are likely to see just what i mean    the book  it s wonderful  it s not a masterpiece  but it s more than just entertaining    the movie  do something else  you can thank me later   it rates a   from   the fiend
