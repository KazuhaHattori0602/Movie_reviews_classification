i have to say that i really liked under siege and hard to kill   watching seagal doing his funny martial arts on people  i have  been always looking forward to seagal movies and  unfortunately  i was first disappointed by glimmer man  which i found really bad  the foreigner is probably one of the worst seagal has ever  acted in  horribly boring  badly edited  wrongest soundtrack and so on  dear reader  do yourself a favor an stay away from this   honestly  stay away
