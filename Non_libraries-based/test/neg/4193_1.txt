anyone can make a movie these days  budget  production value  or experienced crew don t have to stop the self described  director  from  realizing their dream  these days   respect for the craft of film making  or even just respect for any film aesthetic are no longer prerequisites for actually executing a film   director bill cowell must have thought he struck gold when lion s gate decided to market his original film as a sequel to a film he had nothing to do with   i personally find lion s gate far  far more in error than cowell in regard to dark harvest   being made available to the public  lion s gate s deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the state attorney general s office and lion s gate s officers should be pickled in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their utter disregard for film  film making  and good sense   as for the film itself  it s not even worth commenting on
