i am currently watching this movie and i have absolutely no hesitation in reviewing it now  the acting is ridiculous  half the cast must be retired porno actors  and to get kicked off pornos you could imagine the quality of acting   the graphics are unlike anything i have ever seen  i think there are puppet shows with more believability  they can t even afford blanks for the guns they shoot at the pathetic excuse for monsters  perhaps i should also note how incredibly impressed i am at the number of  bullets  their pistols can hold    if asked to summarise the movie  i would say that someone had rustled up a group of complete no hopers at the local county fair  slapped them on an island  added needlessly intense music and let a   year old do the editing   i can honestly not formulate any possible explanation for why this movie was released  recorded on dvd and costs   from my local video store for one day  if anything i have received the benefit of knowing that i am a lot smarter than all parties involved in this film   i hate this movie with great intensity  why  i wish i knew captain  i wish i knew
