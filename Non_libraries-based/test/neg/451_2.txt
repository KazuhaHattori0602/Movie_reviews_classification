to be fair  i didn t see a lot of this show  probably because it wasn t as good as the original m a s h  but i seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule  some shows just aren t worth the trouble of following around every week  but i really did try at first  so it wasn t all bad  maybe i just kept expecting it to improve  but i can t give this show a   in all honesty  i can t give it any more than a   either   it wasn t mash  i m not going to type those stupid  s every time  and it was trying to be mash without putting forth any effort  like it would just magically happen  well guess what  no magic  the best i can do here is to compare it to other shows   trapper john  m d  was a much better show by far  however  they should have called it b j  hunnicut  m d  because pernell roberts looked exactly like an older bj  but nothing at all like trapper john  keep everything else the same  just change his name and the name of the show  presto  after mash wasn t the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original  archie bunker s place was a lame follow up to all in the family  it had no heart  no conflict  no depth   all of the things that made all in the family so memorable  likewise  mash was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war  remove the war and you remove the drive for   of the humor  potter can t yell at klinger for wearing a dress  because klinger isn t wearing a dress  because he s not trying to get kicked out of the army  because he s already out of the army  because the war is over   breathe  all of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything  the least motivated was the viewer  to stay around and watch the show   and from what i remember  the whole show seemed to be potter  klinger  and mulcahy just standing there unnaturally  facing the audience like a trio of vaudeville performers  it was reminiscent of good times  where they spent   of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience  trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation  they weren t  and it felt even less natural on after mash   another random tidbit i recall is that the people who made mash never got any royalties from the spin off  the studio used the absurd excuse that after mash was really a spin off of the movie mash  which they owned  and not the tv series  nice try  but mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie  and he was never deaf  i guess studio execs will do anything for a buck  anything other than make a worthwhile sequel  that is
