after a meteorite lands in  boston   really somewhere in the isle of man  a hideous  fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girl s school  causing mayhem and turning the students into zombie like creatures  this film is apparently a loose  and i stress loose  remake of the   film with the same name  as it features the same monster but a different plot  both films are terrible  but to the credit of the   version  it was watchable  this isn t  let s start with all the problems the acting  especially from the lead professor  was very  very bad  this film is supposed to take place in boston  we know this because the film makers had the ingenious idea of putting  boston police  or  boston gas company  on everything  yet everyone seems to have rather muddled british accents  at least they didn t try using boston accents  thank god  the script is a big flawed mess  the best example of how dumb the writing is when it s established that you can turn the zombie students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  is that what our brave heroes do  no  they run around shooting the zombie students instead  nice  director paul matthews  who also wrote directed the weak   monster movie  grim  clearly doesn t know how to pace his films  the movie is terribly boring in places  the lighting is awful  the film looks cheap and bland  one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore    of the death scenes involve the creature popping out of a dark corner and dragging someone away  while we hear they re  horrified  screams off in the distance  this convention never worked well in the past  and certainly doesn t work here  the visual effects were awful  the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for god s sake  the  explosion  of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful  okay  i like to consider myself a fair critic  so i ll give credit where credit s due the creature effects were actually pretty cool  gotta love those close ups of slimy  drooling teeth   to sum the film up   breeders  is a terrible  cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus  not recommended
