 blame it on rio  is a romantic comedy  s style  with more than an eye full of sex throughout its   minute running time   the plot concerns two middle aged men in crisis  one of whom is sorting through his divorce  the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect  both good friends  they decide to take a vacation in exotic rio de janeiro  each with a daughter at their side  complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other s daughter   this potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines  however it never really becomes hilarious  as it could have  any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn t work either  and perhaps director donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation   not a bad film  but what really ruins it is michelle johnson s awful performance as the naughty little temptress jennifer  while she uses her body to full advantage  it s the only thing she s got  michelle s acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired  no wonder we haven t seen her in anything else   friday  january       video
