first thing i note is the music  it s nothing as amazing as ruggero deodato s cannibal holocaust s haunting theme or the masterpiece waltz from a tale of two sisters  but i don t let that stop me so early in the film   one must assume that the woman researching her hypothesis for her phd dissertation that cannibalism as a organized practice has never existed  one would think they must take into the consideration that they are wrong and prepare for the trip accordingly right  or why go at all if you already believe the hypothesis to be true before even being tested  that s fairly unbelievably ignorant and makes the movie seem that much more unrealistic and badly scripted   that actually is similar to the ruggero deodato s film  just totally ill prepared  no guns  no decent hiking clothing  just nonsense through and through   people don t go on trips like this for college without months of planning and preparation   but i digress   things don t get off to a very good start for our brave yet stupid adventurers as they swerve to miss a jaywalking iguana  and their decoy pet ferret falls out of the truck nearly to it s demise  then to fall into a mud hole  well i guess it s time to walk   okay then they flip a coin to see whether they keep going or forget the whole thing  how does that scene even make any sense  all their conviction rests on the flip of a coin  after they must ve spent time  and money  and preparation just getting out there  this just keeps getting worse  defiinitely some of the worst acting and scripting and music ever concocted for the film industry   mike talks about how he and his friend s were captured by the cannibals and put into cages in mud pits with   inch long leeches sucking on their blood  i found that interesting because if you remember the first cannibal they run into in the jungle  a man they mistake as a simple native  is sitting on the ground eating such leeches  wonder if they are the same ones  really though this movie is just terrible because the script is horrible and the acting is emotionless considering the content  they just agree to off themselves rather then get eaten by cannibals like it s no big decision   obviously mike is insane  but just like in the first movie they treat the natives with such terrible behavior it s simply unrealistic   ruggero deodato s movie easily feels the americans got what they deserved  while in this movie one can hardly blame the natives for what befalls the americans yet again   and because of that the movie feels somewhat pointless  we already got the point from the first movie  so why was the sequel made  the lieutenant s name is rizzo  could it get any worse  oftentimes with movies such as these when you look up the cast you find they haven t really acted in much other films and their bios are all but non existent  so you can imagine i was surprised to find giovanni lombardo radice in this movie who was in scorsese s gangs of new york  now lt  rizzo looked familiar and i found he was in the   movie spiderman as a very tiny role as a tugboat captain  reminds me of how william shatner went from being the admiral on the uss enterprise to a cop in a car  irony  sometimes irony works out  shatner never could get the music right until his recent album  has been  which is really good  just like bono of u  never could get a haircut right  and dan marino never could win no superbowls   sometimes irony is just sad  like christopher reeve  superman can t walk irony  the man will always be a legend though because he was such a great guy  i digress yet again though   at this point you can tell i m fairly bored of even discussing cannibal ferox   cannibal holocaust s message was about who are the real savages and what is truly evil  what the savages do in natural living unknown to our moral records  or what we do to others with malicious intent  cannibal ferox s message seems to be  be careful what you go looking for  for you just might find it  i will say this for cannibal ferox  when gloria comes back and writes her dissertation  asserting that cannibalism does not exist  she saves others who would be curious and go where angels fear tread  but overall this movie was really bad
