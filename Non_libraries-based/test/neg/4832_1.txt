this is a rip off from cellular    bad casting    bad direction    bad music   and the list goes on   well there was no direction since story  scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie    even fight sequence is copied  one with the mace was from kill bill and another one with fire hose was from either a jet li s or jackie chan s movie  i am not able to recall the name of this movie    stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing    cannot expected something original from any of the bhatts any more
