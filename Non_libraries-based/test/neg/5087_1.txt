apart from the beautiful imagery thanks to new zealand cinematographer alun bollinger  this film is not worth seeing   the storyline is so fragmented and lost that it s hard to know what is going on at any given time  and just when you think you re following then the direction changes again  like a lost bi polar puppy dog   the musical score is awful  relying too heavily on extremely emotive pieces that try to force the audience into feeling a certain way  as if the instruments were acting as an emotions queue sheet    feel sad here   feel shocked here   feel scared here  on top of that  the repetitive samples used over and over again leave the audience on the verge of laughter   gone are the days of silent film  where musical instruments were the sole portrayal of voice   but you wouldn t think so while watching river queen   the voice over was so over utilised that one has to wonder if this film really even needed any accompanying imagery  it could have easily been a radio play although even then it would be hard to follow the story   and the stolen ideas from jane campion s the piano are too obvious to overlook  not only are the beach and forest shots almost identical to those in the piano   perhaps some of this comes down to alun bollinger s camera work on the latter   but the voice over feeling and levels too are strikingly close  and who could forget when holly hunter s character has her wings clipped  in the form of her index finger being cut off by sam neill  does it remind you of when wiremu has his  trigger finger  amputated  and surprisingly too with an axe  i thought so   all in all i cannot recommend this film for viewing  unless you wear some ear muffs and just go with the scenery in mind
