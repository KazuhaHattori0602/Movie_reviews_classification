hellraiser  bloodline is only a so so film  i believe it s the fourth installment in the hellraiser series   i missed the beginning  and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box shape thing on a computer screen  but  using my wit and intelligence   and the info button  i soon found out that the villain  pinhead  was released from pandora s box  which  i believe is a gateway straight to hell   so  anyways  pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes the  toymaker s  family  and  that s about it  oh  and not to mention the random tortures of various people that cross his path  yawn   what mainly happens in this film is that pinhead captures the kid  and then unleashes the dog on his wife  and then kills a random person  then he husband comes along  blah  blah  blah  who cares  why it fails is because hellraiser  bloodline is too corny to be scary  look at pinhead s minion of creatures  a cheesy dog that looks like it s been turned inside out  two men whose heads and bodies are connected together   siamese twins in a horror film  and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort   i haven t seen the previous films  now look at the main villain  his name is pinhead  isn t that the name you call somebody when they re stupid  he has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers  and he has blue skin  i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn t have such a corny name  and a corny speech  somewhere in the film  two cops approach him and say  don t make us put some pain on you  pinhead replies  pain  how dare you use that word  i am pain
  blah  blah  blah  blah blah  it sounds a bit clich  if you ask me   don t forget the final half of the movie  the characters  and audience  get to experience more torture when pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum  some person who we don t recognize  maybe he was in the previous films  i don t remember him in the beginning of the movie  this scene is basically one thing played over and over again    a guard goes to inspect a mysterious noise   some other guard   oh no  he s down  i will go check on him
by myself   after he dies the same thing happens again    spoilers  here s the thing i didn t get  in the film pinhead is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end  so  how does he come back for another four films  are they prequels  why hasn t he died in the previous ones  geez  the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series   end of spoilers  hellraiser  bloodline is gory and full of torture scenes  but has little thrill or scare value  just forget it  bad special effects with bad
everything else make this more of a snooze fest than a good horror   good  well
some people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning  plus  pinhead s voice is pretty cool  i suppose if you like ultra violence  you might like this too   bad  none of the reasons above make this a very good film  the corniness and repetitiveness are pretty bad  and  who names their villain pinhead   feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment
