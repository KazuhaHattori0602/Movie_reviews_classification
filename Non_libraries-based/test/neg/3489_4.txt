the `plot  of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through  but i reckon that isn t always top priority in horror  two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the cellar since more than   years  now  he escaped and started a killing spree  focusing on militaries that are homed nearby  `we only did we thought was best for him  they keep on repeating and   strangely   all the army officers love these women and don t doubt their sincerity  even though   of their men died  i don t know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful 
 or tedious  in a way  this film reminded me about `arsenic and old lace  in that black comedy classic  two half insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well  yet they do the killing there  the old ladies in `the beast in the cellar  are by no means less crazy  though  the `horror  in this early  s film is very amateurish and cheap  but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension  too many `old ladies  talk about the good ol  days  though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title  flora robson  who may be recognized by classic film buffs  plays one of the sisters  she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn swashbuckler film  the sea hawk
