some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and there s some sort of creature that s killing them   i usually give a more detailed plot  but i wasn t paying too much attention to this  overall  it was dull and the only time you ll be really paying attention is during the action scenes  which the director did wonderful on   the acting is alright  but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind  you ll forget who lived and who died for   reasons    the kills are boring   the characters are boring   the ending might have shocked me more if i knew who was who   so you re looking for a creatures in cave movie  check out the descent instead
