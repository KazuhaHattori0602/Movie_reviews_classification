this movie had potential  the script was not bad  and it presented an interesting dark atmosphere with themes of suicide  patricide  regrets  and as chris says  years of going nowhere  it s a sharp contrast to the original mag  which was bright  humorous  and even the bad guy was lovable   it s a very interesting change of tone  and if they had developed the characters more  maybe i would ve liked it   but instead they waste far too much time on gratuitous  and ridiculous  battle scenes  poorly edited together  at one point you see a horse fall  and   seconds later you see the same scene again  but not many people would notice that  since there are already   dozen horse trips  i m not exaggerating  and by then we ve already dozed off   which leads me to the title of my review  this film was extensively cut due to animal cruelty  so chances are  if you decide to watch it  you ll get the watered down  kiddie version  there s a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull  and suddenly as the crowd erupts cheering  there s no bull  just the matador in an empty arena  like wow  maybe the bull was a jedi  i dunno  more likely  the scene was cut   later there s a cockfight scene where  in the original version  one of the birds gets horribly mauled before a crowd of cheering mexicans  this was cut  but we still see enough to get pretty annoyed   but by far the worst scenes are the horse throws  one after the other  you see horses  legs get yanked  sending thousands of pounds of horse onto its head  in one scene  a horse gets thrown  and then while it s squirming on the ground in paralytic convulsions  an explosive goes off right under its neck   this film was made in   when hollywood was just starting to regulate animal brutality on film  this is probably one of the last flicks where you can see it happen  so if that sort of stuff it floats yer boat  check it out   you ll get a mild thrill  but if not  you ll either be irritated or flat out bored
