i bought this movie for about   dollars at a local flea market  i thought that with the cast present in this movie  ice t  rob lowe   mario van peebles are all ok  it would be pretty good  boy  was i wrong  this movie annoyed the hell out of me  almost every scene drags on too long  the scene where rob lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever  it was one of the worst scenes i have ever witnessed in a movie  the rest is no picknick either  my guess is when they finished the movie  they only had   minutes of film  so they made everything last  x longer   conclusion  the current   rating here on imdb is right on the money  this was one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  go watch some paint dry for   hour instead of watching this   if you want to see some better movies made by this director  watch  mean guns with christopher lambert   ice t  or  postmortem   with charlie sheen  instead
