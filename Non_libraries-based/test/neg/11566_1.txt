in fact it was awful  the main chick in it who gets topless was obviously sleeping with the director at the time  it was shot at some warehouse most likely owned by family or friends  also they chose not to bother coming up with a story  sure these are ways to cut cost  but are they smart ways of keeping costs down  no they aren t  at the very least they could have found a middle school student in a  creative writing  course  those kids may have at least had a lesson about story structure  at the very least  they could have read up on   act structure but acting obviously wasn t a priority either  watching these jerks run around in funny clothing that was stupid by  s standards was an embarrassment  the fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testament to the limited distribution this film received  had the actors actually seen the final result of their hard work  there would have been a line of people waiting to jump off the brooklyn bridge   i d give this movie   stars but it only deserves   for being released at all  this movie should be shown to film students everywhere  it s better than   of student films i ve seen and wow is this movie a piece of shiiiit
