this movie is one of the worst remakes i have ever seen in my life  the acting is laughable and corman has not improved his piranhas any since     of the special effects are lifted from piranha   up from the depths   and humanoids from the deep   it makes piranha ii  the spawning look like it belongs on the american film institute list
