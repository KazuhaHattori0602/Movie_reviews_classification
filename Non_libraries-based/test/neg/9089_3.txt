this is strictly for pryor fans  just because he was a great  funny guy doesn t mean this is more than a b movie  the script is awful  it just meanders around constantly ridiculing crime and prisoners of war  it balances between comedy and melodrama and keeps falling on its face doing justice to neither    first there are   minutes of rather unrealistic  uninspired vietnam prisoner of war time   the guy is playing basketball at one point  how more can you pander to your audience  that prison time is boring  unconvincing and already can easily put one to sleep    back in the u s  the guy for no real reason at all is considered a  war hero  yet he is of course quickly forgotten by the public and seems to be stumbling into all kinds of wacky mishaps  or are they really  we will soon find out  yawn  there are annoying clich s  his sick mother  his little daughter he never meets  a high end whore falling in love with the hero etc  it is very odd how this movie constantly switches from tragedy to slapstick in one instant  doesn t work at all    overall this in fact is just a bad comedy and does a disservice to prisoners of war  just because this guy was a great stand up comedian  played in a few good movies and died of ms is no reason not to be annoyed by this silly  unconvincing  unfunny comedy  but if you like richard pryor you will probably be thrilled by him reading   hours of dadaist poetry
