i saw this movie when it was first released in   at the time i was young and enjoyed all the normal comedy available  i e  monty python  jim belushi   snl  steve martin  cheech   chong  so i believe that my judgment represents most  sane  individuals   the absolute best part of this movie was the trailer played at the beginning of the movie for the new  my little pony  movie that was coming out   this movie was so atrocious that it was actually yanked from most theaters before the initial week run was completed   i m surprised that anyone would waste there corporate money to duplicate this steaming pile of human waste   don t waste your time or money to rent or watch this  movie
