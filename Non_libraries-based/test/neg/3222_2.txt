a great gangster flick  with brilliant performances by well known actors with great action scenes  well  not this one   it s rather amazing to see such a wide cast of well known actors  that have many good movies in their filmographies in such a movie  without doubt this may be one of the worst they could possibly appear in   first of all  the plot is as you d expect it from your average gangster biography  nothing new  nothing fancy in it  the way it is told makes the movie look a lot longer than it is  when i thought the two hours should be almost over  i was quite surprised that only   minutes had passed   the action scenes look a lot like those from  ies tv series   the a team  for example  it s just that in the  ies  esp  with the a team  those scenes were far more sophisticated than those in  el padrino  it s especially fun to see the guys point their guns in the air and still hit something  not to talk about people that take cover behind car doors which later look like they ve been shot through   the acting fits quite nicely to the action  either you get the same reaction to everything that happens  dolph lundgren style  or it s so overacted that you may think it s a parody  but unfortunately it s not   my advise is to stay away from this movie  any other gangster movie is better than this one
