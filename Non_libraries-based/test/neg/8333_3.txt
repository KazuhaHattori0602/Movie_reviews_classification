i went to see this because i d never seen tel aviv  where the story is set  i was disappointed  since it doesn t offer many views of israel s largest metropolis  it s also pretentious one of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders   the main protagonist is batya  a woman in her twenties  who works as a waitress at catered weddings  her parents evidently don t care about her very much  and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her  batya feels compelled to take care of her  the little girl doesn t speak  and batya can t give her to social services because it s the weekend and the agency is closed  so she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof  and when it comes time to work in the evening  she has to take the little girl with her  the boss is very unhappy about this and other shortcomings in batya s work performance   another main character is keren  who is getting married  at her wedding party  where batya is of course working  she breaks her leg climbing out of a ladies  room cubicle whose door won t open  and so she and her new husband cannot take the caribbean vacation they ve planned  they end up in a dingy hotel on the seafront without a view  it smells bad  there is noise from the traffic  and keren is complaining all the time  her husband meets a strangely attractive older woman   a writer   who is also staying in the hotel  and keren worries that he has slept with this stranger   the third main character is a filipino woman named joy who looks after old people  the old woman she is hired to care for is very crabby and speaks no english  only german and hebrew  joy speaks english but no hebrew or german  joy is mostly concerned with how her son is doing back in the philippines  and wants to buy him a toy boat  as he has asked  she finds the perfect boat in a store and plans to buy it  the daughter of the old woman  who hired joy  is an actress appearing in some sort of post modern  physical theater  adaptation of hamlet  and does not get along with her mother   the way in which these three stories which intersect momentarily resolve themselves is presumably supposed to mean something profound  i didn t get it  there is a fantasy element to batya s relationship with the little girl  and maybe batya s non existent relationship with her parents is somehow inverted in this relationship  when joy sees the toy boat in the shop window  there is a strange effect used where the little sails billow as if blown by the wind  and they do this as if they are on the scale of a real life ship  keren draws the outline of a bottle around a ship that is on a brochure cover in the hotel room  and a narration of the strange woman s poetry mentions a ship in a bottle  but what does all this mean  i thought about it for a while and realized i wasn t going to lose any sleep in the process  if anyone out there has a clear idea of what it s all about  maybe they can fill me in
