how did this film get into the berlin film festival  i understand it got into the panorama section  but still    this film featured     no plot    horrible acting    atrocious videography    some of the worst graffiti ever captured on video   the one clincher that accounts for most of its festival acceptances is the presence of that old standby  homosexuality  that s right  about the only thing that does happen in this film is that one graff artist makes out with another one and jerks him off  then he feels weird about it and they have a boring old  breaking up  conversation that you might expect to hear from your first crush in middle school  featuring lines like  you kissed me first  dude  oh  and by the way  this is no crying game you see the gay angle coming in the first ten minutes of the film  aside from that it s mostly just bad tags  badly costumed  undercover  cops  some skateboarding  and a train ride    if the subject matter is of interest to anyone i recommend looking around the web for some underground graff videos taken by real graffiti artists  there s plenty out there and they are a hell of a lot more entertaining than this crap
