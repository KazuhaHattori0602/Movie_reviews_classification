personally i ve watched it because of lea thompson s appearance and i didn t really expect to enjoy the movie as such  but surprisingly i kept watching it until the end   let s face it   it just one of the saga like stories and isn t particularly original or entertaining  but strangely it just keeps you by the tv  my opinion about will of their own would be much better if there wouldn t be one point that i just don t get   there is lovely and really touchy scene in which lea thompson s character is running on the street holding baby in her arms  the snow is falling  she is cold  scared  and has no place to stay  she doesn t know what to do next  and then about   years later  when things are better for her  she just leaves the same kid without any warning to take up the career she was dreaming about   i just don t get it   i don t see how is it possible that she would do such thing  it was the opposite action to all that she done so far in her life when all that she was doing was aimed on that child survival  after this character flip i just couldn t enjoy rest of the movie
