this movie is absolutely terrible  definately a bull t story and even worse acting  too bad charlie sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies   the special effects are  a team standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood   of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say  die evil americans   unless braindead movies are you game  don t spend  minutes of your life on this rubbish  pick up  the platoon  or  apocalypse now  instead
