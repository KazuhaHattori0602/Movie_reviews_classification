the critics were like  a movie that will break your heart  etc  so a friend of mine and i had great expectations when we decided to watch this movie   i ll make it short and leave it up to others to write about its content  this movie tries to touch you  to reach your heart  but it fails  at least for me  and for my friend  too   everything that happened happened only on the screen  it was always there  not here  where i am  i thought most of the time  hmm  something s happening on the screen  but it s only on the screen  it s not real   movies which succeeded much better in touching me  east of eden   terms of endearment   jerry maguire   babe   mies vailla menneisyytt
