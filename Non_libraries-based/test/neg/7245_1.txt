this was by far the worst movie i ve ever seen  and thats compared to alexander  fortress   and the new world   i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience  for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen  i didn t think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age  i was wrong  while typing this message  i ve thought of a good reason to buy this movie  a joke present at xmas  i m blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it  thanks babe   be warned a true shocker all round
