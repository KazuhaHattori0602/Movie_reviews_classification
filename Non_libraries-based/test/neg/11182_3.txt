on the pure theatrical side  last stand was great  as the reenactments and soundtrack are very entertaining  but there are better accounts of this battle found elsewhere that  while not as long or as flashy  are far more historically comprehensive   certain little details  such as the misuse of the word  hoplon  for the greek hoplite shield and the mispronounciations of various names and words  really ate at me   my guess would be  that because  last stand of the   was aired the eve of the theatrical release of   the history channel was only trying to ride the coattails of the movie s hype   if you re looking for a depiction that s historically accurate in all respects possible  you d have better luck elsewhere
