i normally wouldn t waste my time criticizing a useless movie such as this  however  i m off of work this week  so i have plenty of time to wallow in meaningless trivialities  to start  let me say that i frequently enjoy non commercial  non mainstream  non american cinema   feel free to click on my user profile for a supporting filmography  that said  there are plenty of bad movies that are released in countries outside of the u s  trust me  i ve been tortured by hundreds of them   lost in beijing  is one particularly bad film   the opening half hour is an impressive  non stop exhibition of moral degeneracy  this film provides some classic morals that belong on the same level as kim ki duk s  bad guy        women actually enjoy being raped    rape should be glorified  praised  and respected    feel free to rape any woman you like  because while your  doing  her she ll eventually start to like it and reach orgasm    if you re wife gets raped  make sure you blackmail her rapist for lots of money  but if he doesn t pay  just repeatedly bang his slut of a wife as compensation    if you re wife gets raped  be sure to screw and degrade her the next day while playing the role of the rapist  taunting her with lines like   did he fu k you like this    if you re husband is a rapist  just accept it    after you personally get raped  befriend your rapist and hang out with him whenever possible   how can anyone in their right mind care about any of these characters  they re nothing more than a bunch of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways  but actually revel in their meaninglessness and support each other  don t misunderstand me though  i m very capable of enjoying films that depict lifestyles and morals that are contradictory to my own   ichi the killer    and  moonlight whispers    are very interesting portrayals of sado masochism   strange circus    is an exceedingly perverted play on child sexual abuse   marriage is a crazy thing    is a scathing indictment on traditional marriage  even religiously based movies like  running on karma    and  samsara    have entertained me on occasion  the difference is that those films actually have some interesting psychological content and character development to them  whereas  lost in beijing  has virtually none   it s known that people with unorthodox mindsets exist on this planet  but without some kind of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves  you end up with a superficial exposition of despicable behavior  why  exactly  does bing bing eventually befriend and care for her rapist  why does the wife of a rapist accept his behavior unconditionally  the filmmakers never bothered to tell us  even the obvious juxtaposition of rich and poor classes was ineptly conceived and in the end served as a mere situational ploy  it all feels too bland and forgettable after the filthy opening half hour subsides    other reviewers here seem to have confused moral ambiguity with complex characterization  the reason you can t choose which person to root for is because they weren t developed properly  don t think that this movie has complex characters just because they re not clearly defined  on the contrary  the reason they re not clearly defined is because we know nothing about them or what they re thinking  this is hardly a positive attribute of this movie    on the positive side  the camera work and acting are quite good  but everything else just gets duller and duller as the film progresses  you can place this alongside trash like  turning gate     what time is it there     irreversible    and the aforementioned  bad guy
