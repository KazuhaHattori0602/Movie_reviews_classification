little quentin seems to have mastered the art of having the cake and eating it   as usual  the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought provoking way of sending violence back into the audience s face   sure  mr tarantino  violence is baaad  sadism is baaad  it is well worth wading in it to make that point  how very brilliant   the juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though  but i m confident they ll see the light one day   thanks for making this little world of ours a little better  you deserve a medal
