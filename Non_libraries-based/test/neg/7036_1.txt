one of the worst films i have ever seen  but extremely funny  not on purpose though  every scene that contains anything to do with  aircraft  romance  script or acting is badly messed up   i recommend this film for all pilots  it s so bad that you should burst into laughter at some point in the film  also see airport  the concorde  for the same reason   anyone else  avoid this film like the plague  except for fans of b movies  of course   enjoy
