i will just start with some quotes from other reviewers that describes it the best    this is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst film tarantino has ever done   the only good thing in this movie was the performance of mr  waltz    so i was really disappointed  and seeing this movie on place   of the greatest movies of all time is the only thing about this  that leaves me with my mouth opened  now for more details go and read  hated it  reviews   one thing i hate about a movie is when it treats audience as bunch of dumb people   spoiler ahead  now i know tarantino s style is based on fantasy and fictitious plots  but come on  adolf hitler and   top nazis officers will be in attendance of a movie premier in occupied france and you have only two guards in the whole theater and the surroundings  where also an american african walks around freely with steel pipes locking doors and setting fire  these   guards are then executed in seconds opening the door for our    heroes  to slay hitler at point blank with around   rounds  very dumb  at least  challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time  go watch valkyrie  besides  mike myers impersonation of a british general is more realistic and authentic than the guy doing hitler  just picture that   what ruined it further  is that the only smart and powerful character  which nailed everyone in the movie  with his psychological and mind bending interrogations  ends up to be effortlessly tricked by the most mindless character in the movie   after watching the movie  i was sympathizing with nazis  who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our basterds  imagine that   my recommendations  if you have insomnia   hrs   min to waste or you want to give your mind a break  go watch this movie
