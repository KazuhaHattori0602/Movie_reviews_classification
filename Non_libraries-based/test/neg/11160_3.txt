arnold fans will holler in joy  fans of brainless action will holler in astonishment  and catholics will just holler   illogically written by andrew w  marlowe and ham handedly directed by peter hyams   end of days  gets the terminator out of his open backed hospital gown  arnold schwarzenegger s return to the big screen after his heart operation  whilst blowing things up in mysterious ways and blaspheming biblical verse to give catholics something more to whine about   it is   and doom sayers the world over live in trepidation of their computers going fritz and losing their downloaded porn  even as the technological stank of y k muttons the new york streets  ex cop turned alcoholic security guard  jericho cane  schwarzenegger  with the perfunctory  dead wife and kid  back story for loose cannon effect  must brave theological waters to save  year old virgin christine  robin tunney  from being conscripted as   wait for it   the bride of satan  dun dah daaaarrrh  stupidity ensues   for every anti hero  there is his anti christ  gabriel byrne is the devil here   and he s out to party like it s   on a mission to impregnate christine with the anti christ between   pm and   midnight  december       ironically  in the hour that all porn will be lost   thereby bringing about the end of days  being able to read minds  conjure hallucinations and employ limitless magic  it doesn t occur to satan to expedite the impregnation process by appearing months in advance and courting christine as a teen model and then closing the panty raid easily at the appointed time  instead  he appears on december  th like a keyser soze terminator and wonders why she doesn t welcome him with open thighs
  see above comment re  stupidity  here is a movie where nothing makes sense the moment it is uttered  let alone after contemplating its veracity or mythology  a priest  rod steiger  tells jericho that   is really   upside down with a   in front of it  so wait    prince  is the anti christ   satan soze pursues jericho and christine  j and c   get it  around town  at no point doing anything which would actually precipitate their capture  in one scene  satan recreates jericho s wife and child to tempt him into revealing where he hid christine  but if he can see so deeply into jericho s mind in recreating his family with enough nuance to inspire nostalgia  why can t he see where jericho hid christine not ten minutes ago    satan can make an assassin talk without a tongue  yet he can t make that assassin unjam a semi automatic weapon  and when jericho shoots satan at point blank range  satan is courteous enough to open his shirt to reveal the wounds closing  so jericho won t worry unduly about satan s health   not sanitary to go about with open bullet wounds
 matter of fact  instead of simply possessing jericho himself to get close to christine and rape her  satan expends so much unnecessary energy on side projects  crucifying the tongue less guy  blowing up jericho s partner  kevin pollak  and then saving him  and then blowing him up again  ridiculously battling jericho when he could snuff him out with the effort of thought  that we wonder whether a more efficient assassin lover shouldn t be put on the case   say  antonio banderas   what i find most precious about  end of days  is arnold s valiant attempts at the method   sad  means scrunching up his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent   depressed  means raising a bottle to his lips and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent   deathly scared  means widening his eyes and not blurting out anything in a foreign accent  there s definitely a pattern here  if we could only decipher it   in the end  the devil is dispatched not by the holy men whom catholics pray to for deliverance from apocalypses such as these  but from the atheist jericho  while the timid men of an impotent god exhort  faith  and quiver in their cells doing nothing about satan actually walking amongst them  the prince of darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a big gun and a foreign accent  which clearly says something that catholics blindly refuse to hear  that even if the devil were to exist  those who have been indoctrinated to unconditionally and irrationally fear him would be unable to conjure a belief in his downfall  let alone act towards it  further  they might not truly want him defeated  for only through his contrary polarity does their god s existence become tenable   for it is written in the book of revelations   and the prince of darkness shall descendeth upon the earth without any solid game plan  and impregnate a virgin on a date which won t have any significance until the gregorian calendar of the  s adopts the day numbering which will put it in sync with the equinoxes and the anno domine syntax which will annoy sensible people for millennia  by which time  christians will have forgotten christ s actual birth date and appropriated the pagan saturnalia festival in its stead  and the prince shall effect a revolution through tight purple pants and ambiguously lesbian band members
  i can believe the people being drained of blood and crucified  and the alcoholic built like a mr  universe  i can believe that a giant  supernatural monster can t kill a guy armed only with a foreign accent  i can even believe that the devil needs to perform some hokey thirteenth century celtic druid ritual as foreplay   but what i cannot believe is the  year old virgin in new york city in    especially around prince
