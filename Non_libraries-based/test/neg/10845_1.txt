i rented this movie for about     the most complete waste of money  and time  i have ever spent  it s lame  i couldn t believe how they could come up with something like this   the plot  there is no plot  everything you d expect to happen  it does  only in a worse way  the acting was horrible  my dog could ve done better  the special effects have no effect whatsoever   except inducing complete disbelief  and the cheesy lines  i mean  why even bother    the only credit i can give this piece of sh t are the opening scenes  they were actually quite pretty  and one of the reasons why i decided to rent this  the graphics shown there are probably the best and most realistic cg of the entire film   total reality gets   out of   for not being able to mark it lower
