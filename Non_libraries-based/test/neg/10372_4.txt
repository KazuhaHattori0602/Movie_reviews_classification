i absolutely love the first three movies  they were great  i once caught part   on vhs   years ago  and i was disappointed  but perhaps that was because i never saw the fourth one  because they were shot back to back  but after finally viewing a copy today  i have to say it was no way better than number   my expectations weren t high to begin with  but this is cheap direct to video stuff  not even a horror movie  it s pg  the acting was not convincing  the story was rather dumb without any excitement and there were not many effects  but the main problem is that there were no kills or any gore  the annoying kid who gets killed in his car was supposed to be the highlight  but come on   surprisingly  both parts   and   were directed by sequel director jeff burr who gave us the excellent stepfather ii and leatherface  texas chainsaw massacre iii  i liked puppet master  the legacy  even if it was nothing else than a tribute with the best scenes from all movies   overall  puppet master is very much like the hellraiser series  a great trilogy but forget the rest
