in a quiet town a couple of girls witness the murder of one of their friends to a strange young boy named milo  who lives on the other side of town  after the murder  his body is found in a river and his pronounced dead  so sixteen years later a weddings draws the girls back to their childhood town and claire a school teacher becomes obsessed that milo hasn t died as she has recurring visions of him and her friends are dying one by one and no one believes her when she claims milo is apart of it  so now  she sets off to find out the horrifying truth   when i came across this film  i was pretty sceptical about it  especially when it had  from the creators of anaconda  on the front cover  but reading the odd little plot outline on the back of the video case  it sounded alright and rather refreshing for a change  well  guess what  i thought it was a good idea at the time  but it was a totally different story when it came to watching the film  it just seemed to try to hard to be smart and very psychological based  but that latter element didn t come off that well for me and it was basically a prolonged and mostly unconvincing thriller  hey  i ll admit it had its moments  but hardly enough to make it neither effectively chilling  or memorable  but  a bravo to the filmmakers  at least the story isn t a rehash of those slasher imitators that followed  scream  and shock horror  there s no self referential humour evident
 actually there isn t even a hint of humour  although  maybe it was too serious  especially  since the plot is rather absurd  but that s not its main problem  what a disjointed plot we get  i didn t know about to much that was going on  as it seems to skim a lot stuff in favour for some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences  no  more like irrelevant scenes and yawn inducing clich s that we see from time to time  also you can see some influences from some  good   s horror films  one being  don t look now  this when our main character keeps on seeing the figure of her past in a slicker  the other would have to be one of my favourites  alice  sweet alice  with the person causing the trouble wearing a yellow slicker and committing grisly deaths  interesting idea but it comes across quite shallow and too many faults pop up  i liked it more when the scenes dealt with the character s childhood  as the performances and circumstances had something creepy about it  but when it leans into their adulthood its tired and uneventful for most part and the performances weren t awful  but incredibly mundane and hardly involving is a good way of putting it  most of the dialogue had me groaning in disbelief at how contrived and awkward it was  you ll be yelling  no duh  at the screen  because you just can t believe what you re hearing  the police detective gets the brunt of it    quality wise   the film isn t bad  actually it s better then your usual straight to video i would say  very slick stuff  with some inventive and prominent camera angles and a faint score that works reasonably well  another factor that stood out and was a key to building on the moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and that bicycle bell does leave a ringing sensation in your ears  the setting of a quiet elementary school was well done and rest of the action takes place in a house  but  just don t be expecting any real suspense or surprises as the execution of these are non existent  the deaths aren t pleasant and they re mildly bloody and it s more the aftermath to what happens to these bodies  which tries to disturb you  the villain in this piece  the mean spirited child milo jeeder was mildly unnerving  well that voice and yellow slicker does make an imprint to begin with  but it does seem to lose its effect when we come to the films conclusion  the cheesy tag lines on the video compare him to  move over  jason   watch out  freddy and  this isn t child s play  chucky  but you got to be kidding me  right  he s labelled  the new face of evil  yeah sure  all he needs is to be taught some manners and problem solved  overall  the film just left me with a sour taste  as i ve could ve gone without seeing it  i probably wished i did   just don t expect too much in this blur of a film  or  even better just skip it  as you won t be missing out on much  really
