why it s none other than ator played hilariously bad by miles o keefe  surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater   tore it to pieces  i highly recommend checking out the mst k version since it s hilarious and one of their best episodes ever   the movie on it s own is basically the kind of typical b movie crud that italian film makers were churning out in the early to mid  s  this film was apparently made to cash in on the conan craze  but it fails miserably on all counts   keep an eye out for the scenes where ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang glider during a cutaway    thong  fish is ready   rating  the movie itself  the mst k version
