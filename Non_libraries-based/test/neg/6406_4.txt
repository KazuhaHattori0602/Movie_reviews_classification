there was a time when joel schumacher was ranked quite high on my list of favorite directors  back in the late  s and early  s  when his name was attached to several great films like  the lost boys   flatliners  and  falling down  he truly was one of the most gifted directors in hollywood  then came the stupid  batman  sequels  unfortunately  and after that it seemed as if every potentially sublime screenplay turned into a gigantic mess in schumacher s hands  both  mm  and  phone booth  could have been much better films and even the incredibly imbecilic concept of  the number   should have been processed into a slightly more compelling and entertaining movie  literally from start to finish   the number   desperately attempts to be a mysterious and uncanny thriller and therefore uses all the dreadful clich s from the big book of cinema history  including heavy voiced narration  flashbacks  disorderly structure  characters with multiple personalities  numerous plot twists that grow increasingly absurd and sinister asylum settings  nothing helps  however  simply due to the sheer silliness of the basic formula and the clearly uninspired engagement of cast   crew  as much as you try to associate with the lead character and be open minded regarding the insane theories  this still remains a movie about a two digit number and two digit numbers aren t scary  walter sparrow  jim carrey in a rare non comical role  is a bored animal trapper whose wife agatha gives him a bizarre book on his birthday  the book tells about all sorts of devilish theories and strange coincidences that are linked to the number   walter almost promptly identifies himself with the book s protagonist  a sleazy detective investigating a grim case of suicide  and begins to spot copious examples of the   enigma in his own private life  i did some research on google and wikipedia and  apparently  this whole   numerology nonsense really exists and certain people honestly believe that most catastrophes and accidents are directly connected to this evil number  well  that s just 
 crazy  but hey  i m not here to judge people s beliefs and fears  regardless of how demented they are  and i can only share my humble opinion on a movie that is based on an out and out berserk enigma   the number   is not suspenseful  in spite of several gloomy set pieces and nasty make up effects  and never at one point manages to make you contemplate about the role of numbers in your own life  all cast members perform below their normal capacities  but it was still nevertheless a joy to see the lovely mrs  virginia madsen in a relatively big production again  definitely not recommended in case you re looking for a solid and creepy evening of thriller fun  but endurable and not entirely without merit
