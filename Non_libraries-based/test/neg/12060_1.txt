 st watched       out of  dir brad sykes  ridiculously lame  d movie which pretty much follows the plots of many  s teen slasher flicks  stupid kids go to a known murderous camp site  become hunted by an unknown masked man  and then we try to figure out who  if anyone  is going to live  we really don t care who s behind the mask but even that s not hard to figure out if you ve seen any of these kinds of movies  what a waste of a  d viewer despite somewhat decent  d effects
