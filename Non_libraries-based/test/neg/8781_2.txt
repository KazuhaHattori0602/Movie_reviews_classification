this movie contains the worst acting performance of all time  spilsbury lacks energy to say the least  energy is what clayton moore gave us in spades  i never felt once in this movie that spilsbury was anxious for anything  revenge  love  justice  not in this guy s portrayal   there is also no chemistry between tonto and lr  if the plot did not force them to be friends  you don t get the impression they want to hang out with each other  plus  the sidekick has the more interesting personality  e    the dialogue is predictable and boring   the narration is stunningly bad and if you are familiar with the dukes of hazzard you can picture what this is like  i cannot believe the director would agree to this  it insulted me as a viewer by explaining every plot line i just witnessed   hey  at least the horses and locations looked good  maybe that is what happens when you hire a cinematographer to be your director   rating  you may be able to watch this one for laughs or to demonstrate to an alien what a bad movie is
