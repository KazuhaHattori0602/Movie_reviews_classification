very interesting to find another reviewer who had the exact same reaction to this movie as i did  it was a heck of a lot better when i was   or   years old   seeing it more than   years later  it s still okay  but it only mildly held my interest  what seemed hugely funny back then was only mildly amusing   also  things that were astonishing to me as a  year old came across as just silly  for example  in one scene trinity is walking along and fires his revolver behind him and kills two men without even looking  in fact  he doesn t even bother to look and see if they re dead  because he knows he hit the mark  um  yeah  right   in addition  a lot of the dialogue sounds quite wooden  sorry  but   years later  it hasn t really aged that well   although it s been a long time since i ve seen that one as well  probably a better terrence hill film than this one would be my name is nobody
