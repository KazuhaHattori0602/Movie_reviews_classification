space is a vacuum  right  therefore  space sucks  vampires also suck  a really bad vampire movie set in space would have twice the sucking power  right   it started with what could have been a fun premise  retelling bram stoker s dracula story in the future  there s a salvage crew that s sent out to investigate a cargo ship that s lost in space called the demeter  fans of the original novel will unwittingly assume that this is to be a straightforward retelling of dracula set in the future  unfortunately  short of sharing character names  this one takes the lowbrow route and goes into the b movie galaxy twenty minutes later when coolio becomes a vampire  trust me when i tell you he s the best actor in the movie  and that s not saying much   casper van dien should be peddling his wares on daytime television  erika eleniak should have quit after she left baywatch and poor udo kier is having trouble reading from the cue cards  the guy who plays dracula in this one is more ridiculous than frank langella was in the  s version  if you can manage to sit through the whole movie  you will be rewarded with the worst ending imaginable  the ending makes one wonder if the actors and the crew realized what a piece of garbage they were making and walked off the set   take heed  vampire fans  this one sucks twice as hard
