the toxic avenger    the idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste  mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded ok even for   this movie is listed as a horror  i even have read of a cult following with this series    now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that i couldn t stop watching  the acting is horrible even for an independent film that i think was to be the horror part of this movie   drug dealing  sumo  godzilla entrance  i m all for movies that promote anti drugs  heck i even like godzilla and well sumo  i m not into it but even still i think that the heights of sumo would love to give this movie the   hand slap and ground salt into the eyes of the people that made this movie    personally i am almost ready to write to the film company that made this and ask them for the  mins or so of my life back   to me   out of   is too high it s too bad that there isn t a    zero  or even negative integers to place on a movie here   in other words this movie is j u n k  would rather watch paint dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie ever again  i would be the first person that would use not only the packaging of this movie as kindling but i would be up for a good ol movie and script burning
