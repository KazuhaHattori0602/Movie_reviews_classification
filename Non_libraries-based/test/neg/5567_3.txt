in the early  s  production companies had a short lived craze for supernatural genre movies in france after  the crimson rivers  and  brotherhood of the wolf  turned out to be hits  so several movies were green lit or saved from their  direct to video  fate  however  france  as opposed to the us  uk or italy  has little tradition of fantasy b movies and it turned out quickly that  samoura s   bloody mallory  or the  crimson rivers  sequel were ill advised attempts at recreating a kind of magic that had never existed in french cinema in the first place  as they flopped  producers have gone back to their usual fare  derivative farces or the umpteenth self referential tribute to french new wave by a former critic from  les cahiers du cin ma    broc liande  could only have been green lit during this short window  as it serves no other discernible purpose  it s your by the book slasher movie mixed with vague mythological element and horror references and you ll find bimboesque female characters  a french university looking like a us campus and plot twists so lazy you don t even care because you had guessed it by yourself an hour before  even before the movie started   these elements make all the fun of a  s or a  s b movie and you expect them in a  s or  s movie  however  we re not in the  s anymore and nobody warned director doug headline  as this tribute to the slasher movie genre is nothing more than a derivative slasher movie  headline himself is no rookie and has been writing as a critic about this kind of pictures since the early  s but as a first time director he shows a lack of skill and ambition that makes  broc liande  a bore   when you put together clich s from a movie subcategory and hand them to a skilled and inventive director such as wes craven or quentin tarantino  you get a  scream  or a  death proof  movies that are imitations from old guilty pleasures but also magnify these clich s and add a great deal to them  that s called  talent  and that s why you can t confuse these recent movies with their original inspirations shot decades ago    broc liande  takes the lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements from past movies  unfortunately for the male viewer  the gratuitous nudity is mostly missing  there are very strong similarities  presumably unintentional  between the plot of  broc liande  and the reviled  halloween   season of the witch  as both deal with supernatural druidic evil rituals and some silly attempt at taking over the world on halloween night  as even the plot of  halloween   makes more sense than this one  it means that something seriously wrong went with  broc liande
