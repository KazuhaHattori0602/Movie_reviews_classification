the glorious edward gets to move up in the world when his supervisor tells him that he can drop those filthy swedish drama movies and head up stairs to the splatter and gore department  excited along with his big anticipations for the new type of movies he soon will be going to edit  he asks all sorts of questions  about the wage  his workspace and lunch brake  well  not really  edward is maybe quite the opposite  calm  stuttering guy  on top of that  he got glasses  with the exception when he s insane  i guess that created a much creepier atmosphere   evil ed is with all reason a swedish movie  but somehow a magical force came across the good actors and turned their lovely swedish accents into stereotypical american voices  i guess that s some of the expertise an actor needs these days  the acting is very
 wooden  as in they are inflexible  not bendable  well hey  what did you actually expect  on top of that the movie has a jamming techno theme song  sounds like its e type  in any case  this only makes the movie experience worse  since i m fairly harsh against this movie so far  there will usually be a breaking point where i tone the level of happiness up  but there s really not much to say  the blueprints look good  but somehow  hanz  spelt coffee over it and partially destroyed it  that s how i look at this movie  if the movie ended where edward is taken to a mental institute and they refurnished the parts from where he goes insane and kills people  the result would have been much better  but that s just my radical view  i would also like to see more footage from the lose limbs movies   there are also illogical things to discover in this piece of movie  let s to say that the actors really are american  living in america  why would they then work on a swedish movie  like edward did  and also  that delivery man  why is it that he never uses the doorbell which is located directly beside him  instead he goes away with tapping softly at the door  good old edward really got some good ears to hear all that while he is editing   anyway  this movie had its moments  it s just a shame there were not that many  but that doesn t mean i would not recommend it  it s a rather cheap movie  go ahead and buy  it s almost like i see a pattern for the price and the movie  on the other side  if you like watching dubbed movies getting crappier by the second this might be it  my verdict would then be a rock solid
