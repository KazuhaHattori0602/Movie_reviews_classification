i m a big fan of h  p  lovecraft s books  and the mythos background spawned some rather good other stories and stuff like that  and in the last years there came along some boys who did movies about h  p s work    for the bigger part low budged flicks   and showed them to the public at places like the h  p  lovecraft film festival  now  like i said  most of them don t have a big budged  but they at least know the heart and  soul  of lovecrafts work and films like  cool air  or  the call of cthulhu    are what i would think   gifts for the fan base and other loonies that like h p s creation    and then there are people like ivan zuccon  who just rip off the name and create a movie which would have been fun to watch if i had directed it myself and filmed with some friends down at the beach  that is what mr  zuccon did as it seems but  while blokes like aaron vanek s or bryan moore s earlier movies might not have had more budged  they somehow still had more to offer   like a story  real characters and some connection to lovecraft  just blabbering out names like  nyarlathotep  or  necronomicon  makes a movie not a lovecraft adaption    anyway  this flick will not only make fans of the mythos shudder and hide  it will also not appeal to people who   like good movies    laugh about bad movies    like good c grade splatter movies or   watch everything that has horror written on the dvd cover  i will not go into the  plott  of this waste of time  as it has already been discussed by others here on this page  but like i said  unknown beyond is like a movie i would have made up with some geeky friends  aside from that it lacks ideas for any storytelling and goes into ridiculous  moronic nonsense but he it s art stuff  self made flicks of this  quality  are fun to watch if you know all the blokes in it and ha ha  see how xy is coughing out the fake blood we made from old tomato sauce and stuff   but hey  you don t put this in a dvd casing  declare it an actual movie and want money for it
  i give it   because of the i dunno   effort or something like that
