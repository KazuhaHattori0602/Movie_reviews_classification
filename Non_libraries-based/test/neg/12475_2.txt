a film by almodovar  sends a tingle down my spine every time  the capitalized print which opens the spanish auteur s latest feature instantly induces memories of salacious nuns  gentle necrophiliacs  wisecracking transsexuals
and i haven t even got as far as the infant terrible s critically reviled early work  and after a beautiful opening montage  with the camera roving across a wind swept graveyard animated by a hoard of widows feverishly scrubbing tombstones  i thought pedro had me again under his wicked spell   yet once my nostalgia had subsided  there was very little to fill its place  for a director who revels in bringing humanity to assassins and rapists  he does a very poor job at finding any emotional depth or endearing quality in his women  penelope cruz is raimunda  a headstrong housewife whose life is complicated by her daughter s accidental killing of her abusive husband  thankfully she lives in almodovar s spain where your friends will quite happily help to dispose of a corpse for the offer of a round of cocktails  add to the melting pot the ghost of raimunda s mother and a host of other eccentrically warm hearted matriarchs   volver  means literally to return  and pedro does appear to be recycling old material  the sub plot of incest feels as though it were tacked on as the obligatory  taboo  instead of commenting on or subverting the issue  as with his treatment of paedophilia in bad education  it feels forced and unconvincing amid the film s chick flick sentimentality  i suggest almodovar call his next film salir  to move on
