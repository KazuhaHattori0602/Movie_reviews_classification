talk about a bore snore  this  rd rate biker film was putting me to sleep as soon as the opening credits came on the screen  the shame is that the cast included many fine actors  among them george kennedy  karen black  leo gordon  richard lynch  lance henriksen and william forsythe   a take off of the western classic  high noon  this is basically the story of a former u s  army green beret  henriksen  trying to get someone to help him rid a one horse town of a gang of creepy bikers   everyone tries  but the script is on grade school level  sad to see academy award winner kennedy in such a comedown from his out standing performance in cool hand luke    if you have trouble sleeping at night  this would be a perfect movie video to rent you ll be sleeping in no time
