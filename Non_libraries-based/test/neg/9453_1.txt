a friend of mine loves tacky horror films so i often get to see low budget stuff like this  this is  however the first time i have been compelled to write a review of one   put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen  even worse then boggy creek ii   the entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when dr  klaus stands in this chamber thing   turns all vampire ish   the only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers  but for all the wrong reasons
