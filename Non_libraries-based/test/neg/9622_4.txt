i m trying to understand what people liked about mirrormask  i am an avid film viewer and hobbyist film maker  as i was telling friends during my lunch hour  mirrormask may well be my biggest movie disappointment of the year  just like the short moongirl  the film missed its marks  several times during the movie it made attempts at humor  it sets you up for the laugh  instead of making you laugh  it leaves you feeling empty  the jokes reminded one of the recent star wars films  they weren t funny unless you were five  and the acting felt similarly terrible  i ve seen actors actually act in front of a blue screen  and i ve believed it  but not in this film  not for a second   this film takes a formula and tries to apply it with pretty artwork
 and though the script is totally workable and the special effects quite beautiful  it has no heart to it and fails miserably  i left the film shaking my head and considered leaving the theater  i felt hallow and miserable and still haven t gotten the sour taste out of my mouth from it  i love independent film  i encourage people to view independent films to support them  but not this film  this film shouldn t have been made  at least  not like this  why did the director miss the marks so clearly  they were clearly setup
 not just the humor  but the emotions  the drama  even the lines were poorly timed and delivered  it was like the film walked on three legs instead of four  its steps are awkward and miss timed  and it could fall over with the slightest push
 don t see this film  i don t care who you are  it isn t worth your time
