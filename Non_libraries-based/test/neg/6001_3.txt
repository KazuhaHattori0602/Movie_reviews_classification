i normally love jackie chan movies but this one was terrible  there are only   or   fight scenes all of which are up to normal standard more or less  the bad thing about this movie is it focuses a lot on car chasing racing  the car chase isn t so bad  though not as exciting as fighting  but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring  basically it takes all of things that make a jackie chan film a jackie chan film and leaves out everything except jackie chan  even the traditional outtakes at the end lack their usual humour   i suppose to a certain extent it was made worse by the fact i saw one of those horrible dubbed versions  i usually try to see the subtitled version i wish i could understand chinese   i ve only seen one jackie film worse that this one and that was one of his early forays into hollywood films that didn t turn out so well   avoid unless really curious or a lover of motor sports
