i have only seen this movie once  when i was about   years old  but i was thrilled that they made a movie about the  th division  being from oklahoma and especially now that both of my sons are members of the  th  i would like to see it released on a dvd  i may sound a little bias but the  th division sometimes does not get the recognition it deserves today  the history channel always talks about the other infantry divisions when it talks about ww  and korea but you rarely hear it mention the  th  one of the scene that really stood out for me was when the had the indian code talkers at work and the puzzled look on the german soldiers faces when they could not understand this language  i am glad that all of the native american code talkers are getting the recognition they deserve
