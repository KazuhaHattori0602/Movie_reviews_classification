by the mid  s  the career of animator director don bluth had seemed to drop to its all time low  before  bluth had made a series of popular animated films  many which remain beloved today such as  the land before time     the secret of nimh    and  an american tail    but beginning with  thumbelina  in   his films seemed to decrease more and more in quality and popularity and one of the many unfortunate entries is  s box office bomb  the pebble and the penguin  a film that didn t attract audience members beyond parents and children under the age of seven  frankly  the latter are the only audience members i can comprehend taking enjoyment out of this rather bland animated feature   the story is absurd  the film stars a poorly drawn  stammering  and chubby penguin named hubie  voiced by martin short  who falls in love with a female penguin with a surprisingly healthy flower on her head  voice by annie golden  sort of like in real life  penguins present their bride to bes with a pebble as a substitute for a ring  but when hubie is swept away by the current  he teams up with a lone rockhopper  james belushi  with a dream of flying and they race against time to return to antarctica before it s too late  the reasons why they could be too late is one of many underdeveloped elements of this weak story that would still be weak even if they were there   it becomes very clear very early on why this animated children s musical does not and will not work for anybody older than say six or seven years of age  it just does not have any of the qualities that are required for a good animated feature  number one  the film looks bad on account of a very poor drawing style  the animation in this film is very cartoony  even as far as animated films go  it s dark  gloomy  there is no vibrancy in the colors  and on top of that  the design of the film and the elements in it are universally droll and laughable  take for instance  the penguins who star in the film  with only a few background exceptions  every single penguin looks absolutely nothing at all like a bird  hubie  for example  looks absurdly ridiculous with wide cheeks  a stubby beak  big eyes  and that preposterous hat that he wears wherever he goes  combined with his hand like  flippers  he looks like chris farley in a penguin suit  result  he s an ugly  poorly drawn cartoon character  but the most absurd looking and absurdly designed character is the evil penguin  drake  who frankly looks nothing at all like a penguin  he s a muscle man wearing a penguin mask  he s got a chest broader than that of arnold schwarzenegger  and teeth larger than the teeth of the leopard seals and killer whales that serve as the film s predators  basically  he s a two dimensional  recycled villain  he lives in a cave shaped like a skull  he wears a cape  laughs a lot  and gets mad when people laugh with him  result  who cares  and what s also bad  and maybe worse  is that this is an animated musical and there s not a single noteworthy or memorable song to found anywhere within its running time  the opening hymn was harmless not memorable  but harmless  but after that  the songs became duller and duller and there was one in particular that had me grimacing all the way through  it s the moment that viewers press the fast forward button for whenever it comes up   i felt  the pebble and the penguin  was lame all around save for the very few moments when hubie and the rockhopper penguin rocko are placed in peril at the jaws of leopard seals and killer whales  who were thankfully  given no dialogue and treated as animals instead of cartoon characters  but in a way  for this reason  i cannot wholeheartedly recommend this movie to children  this is the reason  the film displays killer whales are the natural predator of the penguins  my concern is that children familiar with  free willy    may be offended or downhearted by seeing their favorite denizen of the sea portrayed as a bloodthirsty carnivore  the leopard seal was a better antagonist and was more funny seeing as how his jaws opened wider than a rattlesnake s and how he appeared to smile while growling  but the point really is  these moments with the predators and there are only a few are the only interesting moments  and they re not enormously interesting  mind you   bottom line  i cannot recommend this to anybody below the age of seven  my advice  if you have children around that page  rent it for them  they might enjoy it
