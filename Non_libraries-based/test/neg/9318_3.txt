ok  last night i saw the world premiere of paul schrader s the exorcist  the beginning at the brussels international festival of fantasy films  with all the commotion around the film it was highly anticipated   the director was there and so were most of the stars  except skarsgard   unfortunately the movie sucked big time  it was a real disappointment for me because i m a huge fan of both shrader and friedkin s  rip  original   film   what was wrong with it  most of it actually  the fx  you would think that the matrix and lotr digital revolution never happened  it was so badly rendered  the editing  no real pace or rhythm  the acting  only skarsgard at times could convince  the script was a  imo  set up to explain the african scenes in the original film  so the movie had the feel of a set up scene only it contributed nothing   the only thing that i did like was vittorio storaro s cinematography although i ve seen better from him  apocalyps now   all of the time i was thinking this was just a rough cut  a work in progress  and that  given the  well known  circumstances  is probably what it is  but that doesn t change the obvious problems with the script   i had the chance to meet schrader  very briefly  but i didn t have the guts to tell him what i thought of the film and i was so nervous  this is the guy who wrote taxi driver for christ sake  that i forgot to ask him to sign my copy of his taxi driver script
