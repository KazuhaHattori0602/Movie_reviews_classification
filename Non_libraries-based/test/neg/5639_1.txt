as i m listening to my parents watch this  after i gave up   minutes into the film  they have absolutely no idea what is going on  when  charles dickens  stared into the camera  i half expected him to turn into a demon  yes  he looked like one  unfortunately  that didn t happen   this movie had various reasons i did not finish it  one  it was unbearably slow  i mean  seriously  it was sloww  you can only understand   of what is said  and the characters were poorly introduced   if you have an english accent and you like a lottt of talking  no action  terrible acting  cheesy laughs  and the same music sound effects played over and over and over  then this is the movie for you       completely horrible   avoid at all costs
