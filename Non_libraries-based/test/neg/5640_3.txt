its no wonder this was free with the mail on sunday  slow going  poor acting  and filming  camera flare  near start of movie  is not even artistic    straight to video  but not in this case  why not recoup some of your  film production costs  by releasing it free with a uk sunday newspaper  at least this way you get a captive audience  and recover some costs   i have not given this film a   out of   due to the effort to pull some old actors out their shell  it was nice to see some old faces  vanessa redgrave this an t no blow  up  but vinnie jones as a lead  and i think he was better in gone in   seconds when he did not speak   this film is dropping in ratings every day i think this will find its true mark at the   out of  in the very near future
