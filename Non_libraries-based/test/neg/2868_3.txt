i ve just watched fingersmith  and i m stunned to see the   average rating for the show   not only was the plot was difficult to follow  but it seems character development was randomly applied   the actors were adequate  but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns  their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional  once this happens  the story really falls flat and becomes tedious   and just in case anyone didn t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way  this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film   the end scene is disappointing and phoned in  and anyone who sat back and went  ohhh  so they were carpet munchers all along  must have been out for the evening   two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy  none for the rest of it
