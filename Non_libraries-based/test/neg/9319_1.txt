well  i remember when the studio sacked schrader and hired harlin to do reshoots to this film  they were quite right to do so   dominion  prequel to the exorcist is simply a bad movie  it s boring  really it is   it would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned harlin s version and praised schraders  even if no one had ever seen it  would have been right   but they weren t   to put it in a nutshell   schrader has no idea what a horror film should be  and it shows in a big way   droll  boring  unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast   save your cash and your nerves  don t see it
