i guess i should now comment upon a  th flick in the magnificent seven franchise  the sequels still surprise or amaze me by their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism  they constitute or forge a  th way not classic  not revisionist  not european but a sleaze americana  kindred to the violent vigilante  s movies  absurd trash  this installment too is bombastic sleaze inexplicably awkward and even somewhat strange   now what i find disturbing that these sequels not only have their opportunist fans  but that the fans simply do not sense any difference between the original s style and the sequels   these sequels are not boring or insipid but bizarre  they are of course very badly written messy scripts  rubbish lines  it s straight crazy  in this installment each gunman gets several women  van cleef s young wife begs him to release a young prisoner  he finally does  the young man resumes his life  shoots van cleef  kidnaps the wife  rapes and kills her then joins a wrongdoer  van cleef  who has previously refused to help defending a village  now assembles a small bunch and charges the wrongdoer s hacienda  then the wrongdoers charge the village where van cleef has set   i liked the cast   van cleef is chris  stefanie powers  pretty active in the  s screwy westerns  is van cleef s darling  callan  very antipathetic  is noah  a writer and chris  sidekick  the rest of the aggressive bunch are askew  one of the only three survivors  armendariz  lucking  lauter  rita rogers is truly hot  fleshy beauty
