some slack might be cut this movie due to the fact that it was made in   that much said  it really is pretty dire   never mind the laughable back projection or the awful  awful camera tracking of supposed  in flight  objects  it s the stunts that the concorde pulls off that will have you blinking in disbelief at the absurdity  barrel rolls  loop the loops and violent  evasive  maneuvers left me wondering why the air forces of the world didn t just fly concordes as their main fighters   so  here are the important lessons i learned from this celluloid cheese fest      the concorde is at least as agile as a phantom   jet fighter     you can fire a flare gun at mach   simply by opening the cockpit window and sticking your arm out     if the flare gun fails to discharge  do not drop it  as it may then go off     the concorde can dodge up to two sidewinder missiles fired at it at once     a flare will distract a heat seeking missile every time     switching off your jet engines is a sure fire way of throwing heat seeking missiles off track if    above  fails     when performing a crash landing in the concorde  it is apparently impossible to jettison your fuel beforehand     concorde pilots are all combat trained veterans   as you might imagine  this film is not very realistic  the effects are primitive by today s standards and that  coupled with the nonsense acrobatics the concorde performs  makes this a movie deserving of little but scorn   not recommended  not recommended at all
