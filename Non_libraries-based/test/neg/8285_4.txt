six months after high school sprinter laura dies during a race  a killer begins to murder the rest of the track team using a variety of sports equipment as weapons  that s the daft plot of early  s slasher graduation day  a lacklustre addition to the genre that offers very little in the way of style  originality or decent gore   what it does deliver  however  are some stunningly awful musical interludes  a few familiar faces  including an early appearance from scream queen linnea quigley  and a smattering of nudity  a prerequisite of any slasher movie   so forget the death scenes they re lame and rather bloodless and instead enjoy the movie s more memorably crap elements  the rapid editing that can induce migraines and epileptic seizures  the roller disco  which is accompanied by a prolonged heavy rock song    gangster rock  as performed by the unforgettably awful felony  an impromptu jamming session by the school s students  christopher george hamming it up as chief red herring coach michaels  and the cheesy music teacher who letches after his female students  who  for some reason  find him quite irresistible   towards the end of the film  the action picks up a little  with the discovery of the slaughtered kids  bodies under the bleachers  and a quite twisted scene featuring laura s corpse in her cap and gown  but it all comes way to late in the day to save this film from mediocrity
