it is such a shame that so many people  love  family guy  because it is easily one of the worst shows on tv  there are many points to address here    the flashbacks  now  in season   and   which i think was exceptional  the flashbacks were quite frequent  and actually somewhat tied into what the plot was about and was even funny  now season   and on  the flashback s are even more occurring  and has nothing to do with the plot  aren t funny  and really long  boring  and meaningless  family guy thinks that long drag scene which go nowhere are funny  when really it is poor writing   stewie  wow  a baby that sounds british  how funny can that be  it s not  his character is so unstable it s unbelievable  remember in the early season s when stewie was all about world domination and killing lois  well now he just has scene s that are awkwardly gay with brian  from wanting world domination to being gay   bad writing   references  how do they manage to keep making poor references to  s tv shows or events  well they just re use the same old garbage  you know  in   years  hopefully family guy will be canceled by then  if they are still doing jokes about shows from the  s  it will be even more irrelevant than it was before  because will have forgotten  this still keeps me wondering why they can t just writ good episodes with quality jokes   voice acting  my god  the voices in this show is so poor  seth mcfarlene should just focus on his crappy episode writing and stop doing voices  all the extras in the already bad family guy episodes all sound the same  the simpsons get   or   people to do all the voices  a few of them are voicing about   characters all sounding very different  but why can t family guy do that  oh right  it s a crappy show   the stuttering  usually done by peter  stewie  brian and any extras  whenever they talk or are offended by something  they have to stutter out their sentence s just to try get a cheap laugh  i can t believe that family guy can t even speak normally to get people to laugh at their  jokes   offensiveness  ok  short and simple  family guy tries to break the barrier and be cutting edge  but really they fall flat every time  go watch south park   terrible plots  the plots and story lines are just utter trash  the simpsons have started their  th seasons are still have better plots than family guy  about a total of   or   minutes is flashbacks and drag scenes which have no relevance    popularity lots of little kids have stewie shirts and think hes so funny  when really they don t even get the terribly written sex jokes  they just say   oh  ha ha  stewie  when they don t even get it  family guy has gotten canceled twice  and brought back by dvd sales  how sad is that  they got canceled the first time i think after the  nd or  rd season  and i honestly believe  that shoulda been it  those episodes back then were superb  they shoulda left on a high note   drag scenes and falling there are scenes that go on way too long  one that just aired this last sunday  peter went to an executive bathroom  in which about   minutes was spent imitating the intro to jurassic park  and the plot of that episode is stolen from a seinfeld episode as well  also a scene when chris is working at a store and hes talking with the employee for about   minutes about a movie  which also features the stuttering  the chicken fights are so stupid    of them  each one longer then the last  useless  unfunny writing  thinking that people enjoy long scenes of rerun fighting  between a chicken  yeah a chicken  now  every time someone falls down  and by the way  no family guy fan can deny this  that every time they fall down  its under a split second  and they always land with their arm over their back to make them look funny i guess  its been used at least   times   herman oh jeez  everyone thinks the old pedophile is so funny when its just a really bad running gag  they ve even gone to lengths of giving him singing scenes  which are very poor  and basing entire episodes around him  they ve done the same thing with other characters  like the doctor  who i know has had an episode based around him   the simpsons well  not much explanation needed here  there is so much evidence of family guy stealing simpson s jokes  how family guy is just a poor mans simpsons   so im sure i ve forgotten some key points somewhere  but im sure this is enough to prove that family guy is really a terrible horribly written tv show that everyone seems to love  when really they should go watch simpson s  seinfeld  and frasier
