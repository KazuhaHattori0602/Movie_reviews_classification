after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version    i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach    i was disappointed  i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played    maybe it would be appropriate with the guidance of an expert in bach s music that can explain the film    i really tried and saw the whole film hopping that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it  but i did not    see it at your own risk
