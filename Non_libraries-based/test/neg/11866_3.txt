yes it is your typical direct to video action flick  and of course they do their best to change it up a little bit but fail miraculously  snipes delivers his perfectly bland performance that he always does  colloca proves that you don t need any talent to star in a film but just sex appeal  the worst part is that it didn t cover my bad movie basics which are      cheap looking villains      perfectly timed one liners      intense car chases with massive explosions      the hero hooking up with the hot chick      multitudes of nude or scantily clad women for no reason  ok so i lied  it covers those but does so horribly
