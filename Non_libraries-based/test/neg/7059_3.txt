it didn t take too long after halloween had kicked off the slasher boom for the category to be cursed by continuous mediocrity  as early as   the genre was already struggling to release more than three decent offerings per year and by   the stalk and slash flick had become pretty much the whipping boy of horror cinema  by that time major studios were all aware that repeating the tired formula was no longer a lucrative direction  which left it up to independent and mostly inexperienced filmmakers to continue the legacy that john carpenter had created  although there was still an impressive number of features hitting shelves in   most of them were weakly produced and taken as a whole they were eminently unappealing  with that said there were a couple of gems amongst the rubble  scott spiegel s intruder in its uncut form was a superb gross out classic  whilst evil dead trap proved that the cycle had not yet completely run out of style and panache  william lustig s maniac cop was successful enough to launch a franchise and two years later dead girls and mirage proved to be the last beguiling breaths of life in the ailing category   it was the continual release of schlock like berserker  blood lake and rush week that cursed the slasher movie to eight years of obscurity  it finally took the big budgeted flamboyance of wes craven s scream to provide the necessary resuscitation  having not heard anything about demon warrior before i came across it unexpectedly  i instantly assumed that it was part of the low brow trash that led to the downfall of the slasher phase  but with that said the movie boasts an intriguing premise that sits comfortably beside scalps and camping del terrore as another welcome addition to the native american influenced catalogue   a truck pulls up on a woodland road and out step two laughably dramatised rednecks  the hillbilly lumberjacks are only on screen for around for ten seconds and then they are murdered by an unseen menace  next we meet a troupe of five young adults that are heading to the same location for a spot of shotgun target practice on some of the local wildlife  the area is owned by neil willard and has been passed down through three generations of his family  his grandfather stole the land from an indian medicine man that was rumoured to have left a curse on the property  according to legend  every ten years a demon warrior with an extreme hatred for mankind stalks the forest reaping revenge on those he deems responsible for the pilfering of the tribe s home  it wouldn t be much fun if those myths were a falsehood  so regular as clockwork a maniacal assassin turns up with a taste for blood  will the kids be able to stop this phantom killer
   demon warrior is best described as a bigger budgeted  but still woefully cheap  re imaging of fred olen ray s scalps  the bogeymen from both films are virtually identical and the director even throws in a scalping sequence to confirm my suspicions  things start promisingly with some crisp friday the  th style first person cinematography and a couple of shock jolts that were composed with finesse by director frank patterson  thomas callaway did a good job with the photography and the tribal drum score makes a refreshing change from the more traditional late eighties synthesizer rubbish  flourishes of suspense are juxtaposed with a couple of credible directorial embellishments and there are even a few attempts at humour  the killer looked successfully creepy in demon attire and the inclusion of a bow and arrow as the main murder weapon was a deft touch from the director   fred olen ray s notorious slasher was notable for its stark and credibly unsettling atmosphere  unfortunately despite being produced on twice the budget  demon warrior never comes close to the film that it so desperately emulates  rumor has it that the majority of the actors were drafted from the texas baylor university and were not even paid for their inclusion in the feature  so of course it goes without saying that the dramatics are appropriately abysmal  i especially enjoyed the hilarious john langione   an  italian  native american  don t ask  that portrays about as much emotion as the trees in the forest that surrounded him  warrior started with some credible glimpses of panache from the director that actually led me to believe that this could be a welcome inclusion to the slasher index  unfortunately  the poisonous cocktail of heinous acting and an ending plucked directly from stupidsville seriously changed the initial plan i had in mind for a rating  it s a shame that the dramatics were so scraped from the bottom of the thespian barrel  because at times demon warrior showed flashes of potential   all in all  patterson s movie is a mixed bag of ideas   some of them were good  but mostly they were staggeringly mediocre  because this was released at a time when the slasher genre had been watered down to avoid the scissor happy censors  there s really no gore worth mentioning  even the scalping sequence is relatively tame compared to olen ray s graphic depiction  demon warrior has the odd moment of credibility  but not often enough to warrant a purchase  not as bad as the aforementioned berserker  blood lake et al  but not really that good either
