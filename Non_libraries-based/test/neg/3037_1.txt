unlike most reviewers here  i hated this movie  simply because the writer director s bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic  too many film fans equate  extreme self indulgence  to  film genius  but i don t buy into that cult of personality  a film should be about its subject  not its director  unless it s a woody allen film  of course   spoiler   which is just as well  save your time  there is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot long porn star s you know what in the last frame  that s actually called a tacky maneuver that screams film school hackism    the poseur flick has achieved  great film  status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience   which  first and foremost  is the writer director  but the rest of the audience should look down on the surly  brutal nature of the porn biz  too  the flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry  looking down on each and every player it could bash  no matter  just love your writer director  love those four minute steadicam segments  which are supposed to show the energy of the moment  but somehow had all the verve of an off switch  love the story  no matter how dull it is  about the gee whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star  but look down on it  too  of course  while the subject has the potential to be fascinating   innocence  money  degradation  beauty  your worshipful writer director somehow managed to make it all look  again  dull  partly because of its run time  here is something your auteur hero didn t try  giving the characters dimension  or soul  anything at all to give a hoot about  aside from genius that paul is  of course  but i m not buying  i don t buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype    another overlong auteurist hack piece  with fifty times more hype than quality  i know some of you agree  the rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again  not my problem
