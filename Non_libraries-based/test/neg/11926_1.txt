right up  or down  there with toys and jurassic park   and the phantom menace   the premise sounded cool  some of the commercials looked semi promising  but alas  the entire movie had about   seconds of neat shot ness  and that was shown on the small screen s   second slot   if you want amateur writing  second rate effects  ridiculous costumes  and an all around snoozefest by all means watch it  the plot is recycled sci fi fodder  too bad too  because coming in i thought it would be bad but held out hope  it may be the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen a lot    bottom line   don t watch it   unless of course you  liked  any of the above   movies
