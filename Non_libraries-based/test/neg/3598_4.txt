when i heard they were making this i was quited happy considering the first film was pretty good  if a little on the short side   but then i remembered some of the disney sequel disasters i have previously watched  im looking at you little mermaid    anyway i watched it and unfortunately i was very disappointed  the best thing about it is the animation is superb  it really has that special polish that the  proper  disney films have   apart from that  the rest is disappointing  the storyline is seriously all over the place  one moment its about something  then completely changes to another storyline and then changes to another completely different storyline  it reminded me of how the family guy movie was like   separate episodes  turned into a film   i laughed perhaps once at the most  kronk was very funny in the original film but in this he just isn t funny at all   stay away from this film  unless someone lends it to you for free
