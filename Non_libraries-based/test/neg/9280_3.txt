the  rd and last big screen spin off from the very popular itv sitcom of the early  s holiday on the buses is every bit as resistible and crude as the previous two efforts and observing from a standpoint three and a half decades later it is truly mind boggling that even one film was produced in this franchise   what constitutes the plot surrounds the adventures of stan butler  reg varney his conductor jack  bob grant  and their bumblingly autocratic inspector blake  stephen lewis  after their sackings from their regular jobs at the bus depot they all find work in similar positions at a holiday camp with stan s family  doris hare anna karen michael robbins  following therewith   british cinema had a deserved and considerable reputation for high quality in the  s but much of this was due to american financial support and guidance which sadly drew to a close as the  s dawned thereafter notable homegrown titles  get carter being the among these very few exceptions  became as rare as mick jagger in a stable marriage and uk cinema went down the road of cheap budgets sleazy and witless sex comedies  the confessions series come play with me  and flabby elongated celluloid versions of various tv shows mostly sitcoms  this being one of many hideous examples only dad s army and porridge came off fairly respectably in this regard the quirky success of the first on the buses film  it was the biggest box office hit of it s year in  nonsensical to think now  led to two further sequels   to be fair the tv series itself had a cheerful ripe non pc vulgarity about it which was reasonably tolerable in half hour sitcom form but stretched to three times that length it taxes the patience beyond belief it s ironical that hammer films produced this effort as it virtually resembles a horror film in the literal sense with ancient puns hackneyed poorly timed slapstick and awful seedy production values   a chance to send up the cheesiness of the british holiday camp is totally wasted here in favour of the above elements and it is most bizarre if not gruesome to see the obviously  something varney and the beaky nosed long toothed grant managing to instantly charm young women barely in their early twenties while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes the presence of wilfrid brambell  from steptoe and son  romancing the aged miss hare does not help matters either and even though the film lasts about   and a half hours it drags on to an interminably depressing degree   thankfully this was the last film in this most dire of film trilogies and the tv series itself came to an end around the same time with a sequel  don t drink the water which was roundly savaged by the critics and ignored by audiences  following in  most of the leading actors involved were not seen much afterwards but the worst affected was bob grant afflicted with depression and other mental problems for many years he committed suicide in  a sad coda to a sitcom that was the most popular of it s era  it has not aged too well either and should have remained that way rather than the three financially successful but artistically hopeless big screen hybrids which diluted the happy memories and occasional merits of it s tv counterpart   rating  and a half out of
