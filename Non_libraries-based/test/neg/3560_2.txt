i saw this movie on the strength of the single positive review and i can only imagine that guy is a shill   the acting of the female lead is actually quite good  but the entire film is just so excruciatingly boring i could hardly bear to sit through it  this is the very definition of dullness   so far  this film is rated as   out of   on   votes  that must mean the director  director s girlfriend  producer  actress and drinking buddies have given their own film a    for the rest of you  who simply want to be entertained or enjoy a good story  avoid this   this man on the street shall give it a   out of    fda note  while this movie can be used as an aide to obtaining a good nights sleep  no medicinal value is implied or offered
