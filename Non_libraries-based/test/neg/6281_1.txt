i felt like i was watching an example of how not to make a movie  i think the director filmed it in his back yard  there was no real plot    terrible script   terrible acting   the worst production i have ever witnessed  a couple of bad cg effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard   i don t normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one   life is to short to waste your time with this movie
