not many people remember  the carey treatment  and i can t say i blame them   blake edwards did this during his lean years  i e    between  pink panther  movies  and for a story of a doctor turned detective  coburn  working to solve a murder in his hospital  it s actually pretty forgettable   coburn is dependable as always and o neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings  the story twists and turns aren t very involving and even the climax  which is supposed to be nerve wracking  is gut wrenching instead   a missed opportunity altogether  and an unfortunate one at that  since it was based on a michael crichton book    oh well  at least crichton didn t write a sequel to it   one star   carey  on  coburn
