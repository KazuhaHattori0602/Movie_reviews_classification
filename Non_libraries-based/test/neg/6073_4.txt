yes  i realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie  copying amadeus  but it cannot be said enough  scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from milos forman s script with only superficial changes  you can expect to see    the maestro s arrogant scene  i am the voice of god  everything else is meaningless    the maestro making fun of the mediocre composer s work  complete with raspberries   simulated flatulence  just like in amadeus    the mediocre composer s dialogue with god  why do you instill me with music but deny me the ability to compose    the musical dictation from the deathbed scene  common time  begin with the violins  cough cough    and the list goes on   the problem is even worse  not only were these scenes shamelessly copied  they weren t even done very well  jeepers  if you re going to rip off an original  at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way   no wait  there s something even worse than that  it s the fact that the director tried to beat the story of mozart into the story of beethoven  folks  beethoven was not a crass  vulgar slob the way this movie portrays him  furthermore  beethoven was not a babbling idiot who takes pointers from his copyist  a   year old music student  unfortunately  films like this are responsible for butchering history   and another thing  beethoven  in real life  never called it the  moonlight sonata  the way he does in the movie  that name was given by a confused critic some years after beethoven died  and unfortunately it stuck  but beethoven s original title was  quasi una fantasia   and another thing  when beethoven  in the movie  yells  b flat  b flat  b flat  and hits the note on the piano  he s hitting a white key   and another thinggg  beethoven  in real life  was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his  th symphony  this movie shows him as having barely a minor disability  saying  what  every other line  just enough to be annoying   aaand  annnother  thingggg  the american accents  oh never mind  just  never mind  i ve wasted enough time on this already  go see  amadeus  again  then  if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of beethoven see  immortal beloved  which takes poetic liberties  but at least they re interesting ideas  lastly  if you want to see something on the lighter side  check out  impromptu  a film about chopin  but aside from those three  i ve never seen a good homage to a classical composer
