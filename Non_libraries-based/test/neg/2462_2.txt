    the jokes  for the most part  produce silence more than anything  i laughed at maybe three of the jokes  and chuckled at a few others  tenacious d is only for a certain audience  of which i am not   this movie lags in numerous places  and this is where the worst jokes appear  and let me say that  when black and glass are not working off one another  they are completely lost on screen   all the songs in this movie is by and performed by tenacious d  many of the songs perfectly advance the storyline by describing their adventures at the time in the film  however  i felt that the songs sounded too similar to be told apart   another problem with this film is that the language will turn off a lot of people  there are a lot of four letter words in this film  there are also some drug references  i would not recommend this for children   part of tenacious d s schtick is that black is in your face  and glass stays in his shadows for the most part  this is how they are in this movie  and it doesn t really work  now  this may have been part of the act  but i felt that glass just didn t want to be there  in one scene  he performs his  background  lyrics at a party and he just can t work alone   tenacious d are supposedly rock fans in real life  and have maybe two rock legends in the movie  i lost count because i was so bored with this film  personally  i would have liked to have seen more rock legends and icons in the film  however  we don t get that   what we do get is a movie filled with completely lame jokes  lots of foul language  a lackluster script  you also get horrible acting  and an unoriginal story  however  you get some pretty good songs that pretty much sound the same   the story could have been promising  but many of the scenes appeared to have been added into the film at the last second  this is somewhat similar to the blues brothers movie many years ago  but the blues brothers had a much bigger following   and two songs on the billboard music charts  tenacious d only has a small following  with a few hbo specials under their belt  and  unlike the blues brothers  the comedy is not well thought out at all   if you are a hard core fan of tenacious d  then i suggest you check it out  however  like most of the movie audience when this film was released to theaters  i would say avoid this one  save your money on this one  folks
