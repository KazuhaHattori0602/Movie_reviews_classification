well  i got and saw this movie based on the rather high score here   now  and some of the good reviews  usually imdb is a good guide when it comes to score  though in this case i was very much deceived   the movie is a present day detective story  with vinnie jones as the investigator journalist  who investigates the death of a construction worker  mixed with this is a made up dickens  novel  called the riddle  set in the  th or  th century  which also deals with a murder story  both story lines are connected through the discovery of an unpublished manuscript   sounds interesting  it could have been  however this movie horribly fails in a number of areas     acting  mediocre at best  but it is watchable  no worse than your average uk sitcom  though for a movie one expects a little better  especially with a score of over     music  the music used is simply horrible  it distracts and it is annoying  especially the pub music  and the music which plays in the journalist s apartment    storyline  this is a big joke  there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it s almost funny  furthermore  without going into any detail  i can safely say that the ending is absurd  and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year    camera work  at times camera positions and views are distracting  and serve absolutely no purpose to the  story   i m a bit of a movie fanatic  and watch on average   to   movies a day  but this is easily the worst movie i ve seen in months  don t waste your money or your time on this rubbish
