i decided to watch this ultra low budget film from the  poverty row  studio  prc  because it co starred the exciting character actor  lionel atwill plus i really liked the title  even though atwill often played in these cheap movies  his excellent style of acting always made the films seem a lot better  as his screen persona was great  his real life is also quite interesting sort of like a bizarre soap opera  the reason i use the term  poverty row  is that this was a nickname given to the very cheapest and worst production companies of the era  many of these weren t even real studios  but production companies that rented space and sets from the major studios at night  yes  there is a good chance this was filmed after normal working hours a common thing for such studios   the story begins with lionel atwill telling his friends a story about something that he was involved with years ago  a doctor falls in love with a lady but he s afraid to tell her about himself  that s because his job is putting people to death on death row not exactly a glamor job  the doc asks his friend  atwill  for advice on how to break it to her  but regardless she won t have the man  later  you realize it s because her own parents were criminals   later  a man is killed and the lady is implicated though it s obvious to anyone with a brain that her sister was involved  and is a bit of a nut  and the evidence against the lady was poor  but  apparently the jury was filled with brainless people and she was convicted and sent to death row  even more brainless is that her old boyfriend was the man who was responsible for her execution  don t you think someone else might just be able to handle this case  until this fateful hour  her friend  atwill  spends much of the film trying to prove her innocence and prove that the flaky sister knows far more about the case than she ll admit   overall  the movie is only mildly interesting and a bit silly  while it is watchable and atwill is good  as usual  the rest of the film never really rises above the mundane and some of the acting is pretty shabby  it s sub par and about what you d expect from such a low budget flick and nothing more despite the cool title
