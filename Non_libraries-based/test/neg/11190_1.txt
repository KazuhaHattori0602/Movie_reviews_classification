a man kicks a dog   in the air   a woman kicks a cow out of her bed   a man kicks a violin down the sidewalk   a woman sucks on a statue s toe for   seconds   a man kicks a blind man in the stomach   jesus rapes a young girl   there you have it  i just saved you an hour of your life  surely there are those to whom this  shocking vanguard of cinematic expression  would appeal  but i found it no different from the puerile  disconnected videos i used to shoot with my friends in the  th grade  except we never had a real cow   having heard endless sermons from beard stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film  i thought it would be worth my time  make no mistake  this is crap  if i hear one more person call bu uel the  father of cinematic surrealism  i think i m going to punch someone  if anything  he issued a major step backward from the surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors fritz lang  metropolis  f w  murnau  faust  and robert weine  caligari    years earlier  this made a joke out of the whole thing  as if bu uel didn t have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm  sans l absurdit  it would take bu uel another   years before he would refine his style into something admirable  skip the early stuff and hop straight to   if you want to be more impressed by his work   i m sure he would agree  in   bu uel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies  in this case i would be happy to pour the lighter fluid
