a film about an interesting and sensitive period of history  filmed in beautiful surroundings  managed to present an appallingly trivial and clich d production  grossly clumsy script  poor continuity  intrusive slushy music  sugary casting  and pallid acting    it was a toss up between the script and the acting as to which was worse  the script probably won   the historical background  backstory and character descriptions were spelt out in painful detail in the dialogue    actually words can t describe quite how bad this film is   in a pre release screening there was a massive exodus from about thirty minutes in  at about an hour many of those who remained were laughing loudly  i should add i am a francophile  i am fascinated by canada  and love historical film  this really was a one off
