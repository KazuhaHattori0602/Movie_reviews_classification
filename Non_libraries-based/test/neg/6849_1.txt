to truly appreciate this film you had to be there  acting  or have been a crew member   yes  i am  selena  and at the ripe old age of   have serious doubts about what we were doing did   it all started out to be like a  john waters  type thing  friends acting badly in bad films  somewhere along the line the fun discontinued  people who were supposed to be friends didn t speak anymore  and bad became worse   i regret the bad image i might have projected try to fit in size one gold spandex pants   other than that  the film sucks so badly  i would not even make my mama watch it   to my director  cast and crew i say    why can t we just all get along   it s been over twenty years  people
