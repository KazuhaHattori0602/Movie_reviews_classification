i saw this film last night   and i m worried i m turning into one of those left wing liberals they rightly make fun of in south park  because i found it hugely offensive  am i being ridiculously sensitive  firstly  there s the old staple that is america being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything  ever   secondly  and chillingly  there is the early meteor strike hitting some  unnamed   why do they need a name  asian country  the reaction to this is to look at it as a warning  as in  my god  imagine the tragedy that  could  happen  because  you know  it happened to asians  it might happen to white americans  and  that  would be tragic   then  later on  a bigger meteor hits paris  our cast on the ground are irritated  because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought  not much upset in america  no mention that a lot of people have died   then there s michael clarke duncan  a wonderful actor  wasted  never has a black man been so token  among a team of hardcore drillers  his job seems to consist of standing in the back  occasionally saying  hey  you da man  really  why did they even bring him  it s not like he s petite   he weighed down that shuttle for nothing  not once does he lift a tool  steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up   even if you ignore the russian cosmonaut  peter stormare  another great actor wasted in a pointless role  who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because  dat s how we do dese dings in russia  it s pretty horrific   all cemented of course by the site of blond  blue eyed american children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right  because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant   you expect the bad script  the dodgy acting  the implausible plot  fat  middle aged men being trained in   days to be astronauts  including one who appears to be retarded  but i couldn t believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film  and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn fed american   it s a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of western society to the world   and it s a crappy film too
