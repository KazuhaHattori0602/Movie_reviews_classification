this is probable one of the worst movies i have ever seen   the only reason i gave it   stars out of   is the appearance of the gorgeous lydie denier in some of the scenes despite her   years she is an amazing woman in every aspect her nude scene in the bathroom with armand assante is as hot as hell   anyway about the movie well nothing really interesting to say a neonazi and a turkish gang fight over berlin in scenes that include people open firing on the street in daylight and inside a club where   people fire at each other with machine guns in a place no bigger than my house and amazingly after some hours of firing just three die and ten are injured lol   while the gangs fight over berlin terittories a serial killer is killing young children and then dumps them painted white on various places around town   armand assante appears as the turkish detective who although now working for the police was an ex leader for the turkish gang and now is up to solve the serial killer crimes   the movie is obviously a very bad rip off of the classic m movie the killing of the children the involvement of the underworld the character of the serial killer and the ending scene with the  trial  of the serial killer are more than influenced from this classic movie   the acting is terrible the script just stupid the production of the lowest standards possible and in general this was a great waste of time and money   don t even bother renting this one
