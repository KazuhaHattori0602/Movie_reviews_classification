director and fx man john carl buechler doesn t have to do much in order to terrify me  the sight of his name in the credits alone is enough to strike fear into my heart   his lamentable straight to video output in the  s sat on the bottom shelf of the horror section at my local rental shop  twenty years later  and his dvds occupy the same space  it seems that the more things change  the more they stay the same  you can rely on old jcb to serve up dreck  whatever the format and regardless of advances in movie making technology   in this contemptible offering  a bunch of friends travel to a remote town where they discover the secret treasure hoard of jeremiah stone  aka the forty niner an evil  claim jumping  cannibalistic miner who caused havoc in the mid s  before his death  jeremiah cursed anyone who should find his gold  and it s not long before the pick axe wielding killer is back  bumping off the hapless treasure seekers   with its dreadful script  unimpressive make up effects and scooby doo style villain   the curse of the forty niner  is par for the course for buechler  only genre stalwarts keren black  richard lynch and john phillip law lend this movie any credibility whatsoever  with the rest of the cast giving performances ranging from bad to awful  although i ll forgive alexandra ford  who is a complete hottie   even fans of bad schlock horror will be disappointed since most of the women keep their clothes on  and a lot of the deaths occur off screen  which is probably not such a bad thing since the on screen deaths are pathetic    the curse of the forty niner  is another in a long list of duds for john carl
