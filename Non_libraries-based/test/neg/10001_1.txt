first of all i hate those moronic rappers  who could nt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads  all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clich e version of gangsters   the movie doesn t take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before we re already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie  except for the homeless guy  who is also the only one with half a brain   bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters  i did nt like him right from the start   the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty  people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere  there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one  everybody dies  except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve   the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but they re actors by profession  not annoying ugly brain dead rappers   stay away from this crap and watch   hours   and   instead  at lest they have characters you care about  a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast
