after his career as a romantic leading man ended in the late  s  rock hudson starred in lots of different projects  including tv shows and lesser films  however  i believe that  embryo  is his only turn as a mad scientist  and that s probably a good thing  i guess he needed the work   driving along one dark and stormy night  brilliant dr  paul holliston  hudson  hits and injures a doberman  which he brings back to his lab  that looks somewhat like a dank midwestern basement  he then manages to raise the dog s unborn puppy outside the womb  so naturally he decides to do the same thing with a human being  he raises victoria  the beautiful barbara carrera  from a fetus the same way  victoria grows at an astonishing pace  and soon blossoms into a gorgeous young woman   predictably  things go very wrong  after a halcyon beginning  holliston s sister in law martha  diane ladd  begins to wonder where the young woman came from  and victoria herself begins to show signs of instability and violence  the final sequence is one long car chase straight out of  smokey and the bandit  after which victoria who has shockingly aged in just a few minutes is assaulted by a frantic holliston  who tries in vain to destroy his malformed creation along with its unborn child  all of this is accompanied by screeching tires  roaring engines  a car fire  and lots of sirens  the limp ending a bunch of paramedics frantically working on victoria while holliston writhes in regret is more labored than creepy   although just made in   this movie is very dated  the only difference between this and the many  s mad scientist movies is that hudson plays the lead role rather than boris karloff  the sets are pretty cheap and very antiquated to today s audiences  to the extent that hudson s reel to reel tape recorder is about the size of a refrigerator  much of the action takes place in a poorly lighted laboratory  hudson sleepwalks through his sordid role  giving the impression that he s truly a washed up movie star  while ladd and carrera are much more believable  surprisingly  roddy mcdowall pops up briefly as a chess player   the passport video transfer is very substandard  looking as though it had been made from a poor vhs copy using home equipment  if you re nostalgic for   watch this once just to say you did  otherwise  watch a football game or soap opera instead
