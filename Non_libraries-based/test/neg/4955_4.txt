if there s one thing i ve learnt from watching george romero s creepshow  it s that if you stumble upon an mysterious old crate that someone has obviously gone to a lot of effort to hide  just leave well alone  there s probably something nasty inside   obviously  professor gordon crowley  robert englund s character in  jack brooks  monster slayer  isn t a romero fan   cos he busts open the old wooden box he finds buried in his yard  only to discover surprise  surprise an ancient demon that possesses his body  initially causing him to eat and vomit rather a lot   when the demon eventually erupts from crowley s body during chemistry class and begins to transform the students into hellish  flesh tearing beasts  it s up to plumber jack brooks  trevor matthews  to try and stop the foul creatures  armed only with a length of pipe and fuelled by a lifelong hatred of all things monstrous   the dvd packaging for jon knautz s low budget monster flick promises one hell of a fun ride  offering cheesy thrills and spills of the kind one might expect from your average  s creature feature  toothy critters  rubber monster suits  gruesome gore  and absolutely no cgi and for the last   minutes  that s exactly what viewers get  non stop splattery effects  a silly  tentacled jabba style demon thingy  and mucho macho monster mashing   it s a shame  then  that the rest of the film s running time a massive   minutes or so is mostly spent following jack as he goes about his boring  everyday business  plumbing  visiting his shrink  going to chemistry class  and upsetting his girlfriend  if you think you might enjoy a film that focuses primarily on coping with childhood trauma and anger management  buying spare boiler valves from a hardware shop  and the chemical properties of sodium  then this is the film for you  but if it s a massive dose of monster mayhem you re after  then i d advise looking elsewhere
