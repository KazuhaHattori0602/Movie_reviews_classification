i saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie   that is something that i have not done since   i have never fallen asleep at the movies   i love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone  this may have been the problem but i do not think so  because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work   bette was under used and anne was over used and miscast   i do not know why english or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition   they billed this as a sex in the city but better  not a chance i liked sex in the city a lot and was disappointed by this movie   so do not waste your money on this movie   go see anything but this
