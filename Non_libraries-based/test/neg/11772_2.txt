it s not often i give two stars to a horror movie because horror is my favorite genre  a movie can be bad in that it isn t a masterpiece but can be enjoyable on the basis of unintentional humour  bizarre characters  etc  a case in point are a great number of horror sci fiction movies from the  s to  s era  they are enjoyable for genre buffs and guilty pleasure seekers because their  badness  is entertaining  however  this movie has none of the humour or effective gory scenes of the  piranha    original    i suppose in   it was the heyday of political correctness so gore on tv was at a minimum  now in the mid s with the c s i  shows  tv s an absolute blood fest   good for us horror fans   william katt and alexandra paul are no bradford dillman and heather menzies  the original   stars  it s not katt s and paul s faults but the writers and director who created this tepid turkey  how the main characters interact is the main flaw of this movie  i won t say how because that is part of the plot    this tv movie probably had a bigger budget than the original but flopped as good horror  as can be seen from the user votes here  stick with the   original if you re in the mood for a killer fish movie
