oh yeah  this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of  worst  s slasher ever made   the prey  has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick  a routine  derivative plot that you ve seen a thousand times before  and better  insufferable characters and terrible performances  a complete lack of gore and suspense  fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and   most irritating of all   the largest amount of pointless padding footage you ve ever encountered in your life  and that s not an exaggeration but a guarantee  apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage  which i ll expand upon later  this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude   and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that aren t even remotely funny  the set up is as rudimentary as it gets  with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voice over human screams  fast forward nearly forty years later  when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe whacked by something that breathes heavily off screen  this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since  enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds  unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer   the prey  is an irredeemable boring film  apparently it was shot in   already  but nobody wanted to distribute it up until   and it isn t too hard to see why  in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant  this would only be a short movie with a running time of   minutes  possibly even less  there s an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage  sometimes of animals that i think don t even live in that type of area  and they seem to go on forever  the only thing missing  in fact  is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals  habits  animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at  but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy  s slasher movie  for crying out loud  the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile  with some potent killing sequences and fine make up effects on the monster  who turns out to be lurch from  the addams family  movies  but still silliness overrules   the scene with the vultures is too stupid   and the final shot is just laugh out loud retarded  as mentioned above   the prey  easily makes my own personal list of worst  s slashers  alongside  appointment with fear   berserker   deadly games   don t go in the woods   hollow gate   the stay awake  and  curfew
