the movie starts good  it has a thing going for it  about   into the movie things go downhill  carrey starts obsessing about the number   because he sees it everywhere  so what  thats no reason to go nuts and start writing stuff all over your body and on walls   the acting by whoever is playing his son is bad  from the get go  as soon as he hears of his fathers obsession  he jumps on the bandwagon and is hysterical about it  totally unbelievable  i hope i never see this kid in another movie again   its a waste of time watching this movie  grab another  boring piece of   well  the number is killing him  give me a break  i won t spoil the ending for you  but let s just say it is equally disappointing
