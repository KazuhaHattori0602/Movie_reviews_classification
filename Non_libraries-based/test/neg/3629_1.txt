zeoy  really  this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age group s attention  it s about some preppy girl named zeoy and her friends that attends boarding school  boring  all she ever does is whine and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot  i remember this show came out in   i was   going on   and even then i thought it was pointless  the only episode i ever liked was when the boys hid a camera in the girls dorm  that s it  anyway  i just don t understand why nickel oh my bad nick feels the need to syndicate this sorry poor excuse for  entertainment  serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst  what s with this generation   anyway  r i p  nickelodeon
