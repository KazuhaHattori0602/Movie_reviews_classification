i was giddy with girlish glee when i found out about this movie shortly after seeing spirits within   after years of anticipation  they gave november   release date  well  november came  and went  followed by december  oh  look  today s january     no us release as of yet   oh well  i m so glad i had a friend with a bootlegged subtitled copy   d  well  the cg was great  not as good as expected  but near perfect  i cringed  however  at the unnatural movements made by the children throughout the movie  i had thought that we were passed this by now  also  i didn t really care for the anime look given to their faces  i was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic look to the film  and yet most of the characters have larger than norm eyes  especially the girl characters  they had personality  though  i ll give them that   even though i m not a big fan of anime  i do have to say i was impressed with the wild fight scenes  they were animated beautifully and had me hanging onto the edge of my seat   for about the first two   and there in lies advent children s biggest flaw  it s mostly just a bunch of hyper stylized fight scenes   a ff  sequel of epic proportions had been promised for years  instead  they gave us a pretty piece of cg with barely a plot to excuse it s just under two hours running time   where final fantasy is famous for its intricate stories  this movie falls short  you don t really get to know the characters  the only way you d have any understanding of most of what occurred in the film would have been if you had played the game  we barely got to see them before they were battling it out with whatever current threat   what hurts the fans even more is the awful cameos that the majority of ff  characters were given  they were nothing more than cloud s  i ll call if i need you  but i probably won t  back up singers  and  to add to the hurt  they had each character individually throw cloud higher and higher  this little part here was so cheesy i almost turned it off  i would have been much more impressed if he had just simply jumped up all on his own  ricocheting off of walls to get himself up higher   it hurt even more when they reduced the turks to less than just comic relief  that was fine for the game  but this is cinema  people do not act like cartoon characters in a harsh battle  they took away their dignity    and  spoiler  yeah right  most of you probably already know  anyhow  who remembers darth maul being hyped up in sw  episode   yeah  now  picture that  but with sephiroth  that s right  he had maybe   minutes of screen time  maybe that  end spoiler  p  if this movie was made for the fans  then way to go square  if this is any indication of the direction you re taking the ff series  i doubt you re going to be seeing much of my money  i played your games for the wonderful story and the excellent characters   you had a chance to make something epic  something truly beautiful  a masterpiece that flies in the face of all of the disney cg films   instead you gave us a pretty piece of flesh with hardly anything underneath to hold it together  way to go   and i m sure if the rest of the fans paused for a moment and tried to just pay attention to everything but the cg they d know what i m talking about  well  i was gonna rate this a   but after thinking about it while righting this  i m giving it a   because they could have done better  they have done better  and this is just sad   if they re gonna remake anything ffvii  they need to do this one first
