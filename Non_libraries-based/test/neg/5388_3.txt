this film may be great  but it is a complete ripoff of bill forsythe s comfort and joy  c j is one of the sweetest films i ve ever seen without becoming diabetic   it s ok if you do like it  but realize that everything in this film is a direct rip off   the original is   i can recommend almost anything by forsythe   local hero  gregory s girl  that sinking feeling  i better go rent some tonight  local has a young peter capaldi  and an old burt lancaster   unfortunately he s given up film making after some really crappy hollywood treatment  sad
