  and look at customer reviews for carrot top s movie and other performance dvd  one will find several that could be construed as death threats to mr  top   one other curious fact about this film  i recall that mike nelson  the head writer for mst   in his book mike s mega cheese about movies  good and bad  said he saw this film and shortly afterwords couldn t recall a thing about it  including the title  obviously mike was suffering a classic reaction to trauma  viewing this atrocity was so soul numbing  mike nelson had to block it from his mind   evidently  in a later chapter in his book  mike nelson had recovered his memeory of this film  from the review he offers  mike nelson was definitely not grateful for the recovered memory   the only comment i offer about the film  and it is not a spoiler  it s simply god s honest truth  it s not funny  none of it is  not even a nanosecond of it is funny
