first and foremost i wish to aim a big   mean middle finger towards the troma dvd distribution crew  who were actually stupid enough to reveal the identity of this movie s pivot killer on the back of the cover  the synopsis just randomly mentions who s the person responsible for the massacre on graduation day  for christ s sake  i don t care how terrible or how predictable an  s slasher can be  just mentioning who did it ruins the whole point  so  a word of advise in case you also purchase the troma double feature containing  graduation day  and  nymphoid barbarian in dinosaur hell  do not   repeat do not   turn the box around and read the back  watching the film is already a painful experience  but reading the back would really spoil everything   now  as for the actual the actual movie
 oh boy  personally i m a fan of the cinematic  work  of herb freed  well actually  i don t really know whether i should admire him
or pity him  all herb s films are pretty bad   amateurish  but at the same time you can tell his direction is spirited and full of good intentions  unlike with  haunts  and  beyond evil  he followed a contemporary popular genre trend and tried to cash in on the typical high school slasher films  just to offer a minimum of originality  all the victims in  graduation day  are promising athletes and members of the same track of coach george michaels  awesome name  i guess herb freed is a fan of  wham  during the opening credits  we witness how a young girl dramatically dies on the field  moments after winning a   seconds running race  the debate of whether or not her coach and fellow track team members weren t pushing her physical limits too much is raised  but one particular individual goes one step further and begins to sadistically kill everyone he she considers responsible for laura s death  what a demented little movie  the script must be one of the most incoherent ones i ever beheld  with loads of red herrings and sub plots that go absolutely nowhere and death sequences that are almost too cheesy for words  there s a bloke impaled by a football attached to a javelin  others are decapitated with an absurdly big sword and the unluckiest bastard of them all even falls to his death on a disguised bed of spikes  herb concentrates on the ingeniousness   the fast pacing of the killings so much that he totally forgets about the sub plots he introduced earlier in the film  for example  laura s sister returns home from her military training and seemly starts an investigation regarding the circumstances of her death  halfway through the movie  however  her character hardly appears in the movie anymore  also  the girls  stepfather is referred to as a violent drunkard but this interesting given immediately gets ignored as well  instead of carefully mounted suspense and misleading red herrings  we re served disco dancing   roller skating sequences and   of course   numerous images of unattractive  s chicks stripping their tops off  despite being really bad   graduation day  could count on a respectable cast  christopher george  grizzly   city of the living dead  greatly stars as the demanding coach  carmen argenziano  when a stranger calls   the accused  briefly appears as a police detective investigating the rising number of missing teenagers and michael pataki  dead   buried   dracula s dog  has a very amusing part as the school s stressed out principal  the teenage beauties on duty include linnea quigley and vanna white  heck  for some horror fans  the presence of these two ladies is enough reason already to count  graduation day  among the most quintessential slashers of the early  s  it s a dumb film  but entertainment and chuckles are guaranteed
