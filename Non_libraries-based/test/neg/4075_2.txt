i gave this film a   mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so  insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three   very predictable plot two nare do well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems  however when a friend leaves a bag full of money  that belongs to drug dealers  in their care they of course spend it and then the  fun  begins   not an original idea in this whole film
