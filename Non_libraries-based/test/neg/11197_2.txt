i mean  come on  this movie had such nice potential but it s like they ran out of money to finish the script and just telegraphed the whole damn rest of the movie about  rds of the way through  characters start spouting this movies whole reason for existence to other characters who didn t ask for the information on extremely flimsy premises  they also fall into some stereotypical behavior because that must be what s expected in this genre of movie  it s really pretty sad because this movie could have been so much more   i was really hoping this would be a good movie  there was some good acting  mark hamill does an excellent job until the movie falls apart  so does sally struthers  it was fun to see them working and succeeding at their craft  majandra delfino was pretty good for awhile until her lines just became untenable  i felt sad for her that she had to say these lines that just shot the whole movies credibility for any thinking movie goers  brad hunt does an excellent job  he really has a surprising range of talent judging from another of his movies i recently saw  lucky    which was a piece of crap  this guy could be a star if he could pick the right scripts and get lucky with the right director   almost forgot  the music was so heavy handed you might think this project was handed to some minor film school to be scored  i call this kind of music  teller music  because you can just tell what s coming next based on the music  less is more sometimes   cut half of the music from this movie  get a good film editor  a small rewrite or two and this would be a very good movie
