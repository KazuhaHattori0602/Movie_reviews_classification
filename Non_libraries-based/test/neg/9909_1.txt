contains major spoilers  on the off chance you would actually care about the story line   ok  we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid   predictable schlock from the start  and if that weren t enough  the   second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been  for example  will they make it to the airport in time  things look dim as we go to a commercial
and the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane  well  i guess they re gonna make it after all
but then again  they had to because they re good guys   the acting wasn t any too impressive  exception and welcome relief  randy quaid as tornado tommy    the effects were kinda lame  the bad guys got it  and the good guys came through  the real disaster of this movie was the script  especially the ending  not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given   hours notice of a cancellation  but they glorified the hacker as well intentioned  so he caused a bazillion deaths
he meant well  and  of course  an uplifting final tv report about people coming together  barf  it was everything i expected from the commercials  and i m glad i wasted my time watching it  it will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow   is cbs insulting us by making this  sure
but we watched it  didn t we  did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig   here s hoping for the next plan   from outer space  which gets better with each viewing  this isn t it     star
