this movie is   in the list of worst movies i have ever seen  with  lessons for an assassin  on the   spot   the acting is lousy  sorry  sandra bullock  but even your performance was horrible  the music score could have come from a bad x rated movie and the story was downright ridiculous  it had this in common with a typical action movie  the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of one syllable words  but contrary to the average action movie  there was no real action in this one  boring   the only reason i continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point  there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie    thumbs down on this one
