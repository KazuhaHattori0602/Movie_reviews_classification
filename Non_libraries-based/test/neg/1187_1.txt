this review took longer to write than i took to watch this film  it s just plain bad  the plot is terrible in comparison to the tv shows  it is flat  unfunny and boring   it is clear that the log ran out of ideas long before this film was green lit  viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop   bad editing  bad music  bad acting  zero dynamism  zilch chemistry   a film that doesn t know what it is  made without any love to some mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feeling kind of angry that so much money was wasted   the log obviously were made an offer they couldn t refuse  or perhaps their egos have simply got the better of them  it s a bleak marketing push that perhaps would have been better when the log were fresher and more inspired   i however  did know when to stop  and did   please  someone try to convince me of this film s finer points
