i really don t know if this was supposed to be science fiction or horror  it was confusing to say the least  what really upset me  however  was the lack of story development between the characters   the sheriff s  bruce boxleitner   year old daughter  clara bryant  is stuck with him for the summer  and they don t spend   seconds on screen together at any one time   the hot native american  jennifer lee wiggins  apparently has the hots for the sheriff  but they don t spend any time together either   the hot secretary  kristen honey  ends up dead and she had more acting ability than the other two put together   the bad developer vs  the native americans is an overused story  but i personally like evil developers getting theirs as i live in florida   the only reason i stayed with this was the creature  it was original  i have never seen anything like it and i am a sucker for new creatures
