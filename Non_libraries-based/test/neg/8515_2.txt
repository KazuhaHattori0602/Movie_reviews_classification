i ll give it a two because it has a lot of music  otherwise it would be a one   i saw this movie for the first time tonight and it s the first  road  picture i ve seen  i was expecting waaaaay better  robert osborn says this is the best of the road movies  if that s true i needn t bother to see the others  the best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half  but that s balanced out by only one production number with dancing in the entire movie   i didn t like the movie  neither hope nor crosby came across all that well  their characters weren t very charming  the movie was not funny at all  most of the dialog was just lame filler  there wasn t much action  there wasn t much spectacle   the movie wasn t what i expected  i was expecting more  road  but there isn t much  they quickly make it to the palace and then most of the movie takes place there  until the end  i was also expecting a lot more of the famous  road  style of breaking the fourth wall  wherein the characters talk directly to the audience or comment on the plot  there was only about   instances of that  one of those is an example of the non funny humor of this script    hope recaps the plot up to now to crosby  crosby  i know all that  hope  yeah but the people that came in half way through the picture don t  crosby  you mean they missed my song   those are two weak punchlines  but at least they are actually jokes  much of the rest of the script doesn t even have any jokes  an example is    crosby  remind me to throw you a piece of cheese in the morning   indirectly calling hope a rat   that s not funny at all  it barely even qualifies as a joke  but that s the kind of non joke dialog that carries most of the movie  many of the scenes don t even come that close to a joke  just using generic uninteresting dialog like   crosby  hey  whadda ya  take me for  you think that you can just throw me to the dogs  hope  well why not  you did it to me didn t you  crosby  yeah but that s because i was lookin  out for us  you re not lookin  out for nobody  hope  oh yeah  well then why did i pay the check    the above is just from my memory  it s not exact but it illustrates to you what i mean   and so on just generic dialog with no jokes at all   my grade  a waste of time
