i completely understand the historical significance of rocketship x m  but that doesn t make it a good movie  to begin with  the plot  or what there is of it  is dull and lifeless  five astronauts blast off for the moon   they get knocked off course and end up on mars  huh    cavemen looking martians throw rocks at them   they return to earth and meet a fiery death   the end  believe it or not  but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is  to make matters worse  john emery s character  dr  karl eckstrom  feels it necessary to give long drawn out speeches on everything from the nature of man to the dangers of nuclear weapons  it s just a thrill a minute  sarcasm intended   looking back at rocketship x m almost   years later  i would call the portrayal of women funny if it weren t all so sad and misguided  there are a number of examples i could cite  but there s one exchange of dialogue just after take off between the male chauvinist pilot floyd  played by the irritating  plastic haired lloyd bridges  and dr  lisa van horn  the only female crewmember and the constant object of floyd s often creepy attention  that illustrates the film s attitudes toward women quite nicely      floyd   i ve been wondering  how did a girl like you get mixed up in a thing like this in the first place      dr  van horn   i suppose you think that women should only cook and sew and bear children      floyd   isn t that enough    i think floyd should have stayed behind with the cavemen
