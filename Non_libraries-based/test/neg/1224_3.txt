lonesome dove is my favorite western second only to the searchers with john wayne  i watch lonesome dove about every   months and never get tired of it  i have read all the ld books  although i cannot remember much of comanche moon  i too looked forward to this mini series and decided to tape it on our dvr so we could fast forward through commercials  unfortunately  i messed up and didn t record the first part  but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up   there is nobody that can ever compete with robert duvall or tommy lee jones  and i was expecting to be disappointed and i was   although there were so many things that didn t ring true  the most apparent to me was when nellie died the day before and gus was out on the range  it switched over to clara writing him a letter from nebraska telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death  how in the world could she have known the next day way out in nebraska  additionally  it was supposed to be   years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about   years old  maybe a little younger  yet more time went on before they actually moved to lonesome dove  and in lonesome dove they had been there about   years or longer before leaving to montana  when they stopped at clara s in nebraska  which probably took another   months on the trail  the girls looked to be about   since they were playing in the yard like little children  the math just does not add up   i agree that the man who played gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like gus may have looked as a young man   i am also a little confused about one thing  the captive white girl that they brought back   was she the one they captured when they raided austin  they said she had been captured   years ago  but if she was the one captured in austin  it was only   years later when this took place in the movie  was she captured earlier  i remember seeing a captive girl after they raided the town and don t know if this is the same one  if someone can explain since i missed part   if it had been   years  she would probably be over   years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground  also  the way they were ravaging her when they captured her  it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having indian children   i have to admit though  nothing is worse than john voight playing call in the sequel to lonesome dove or the unbelievable marriage of lorena to pea eye in the mcmurty sequel to lonesome dove  which was never explained either  also  the way he killed newt off was i hear from spite for them doing the sequel with john voight without his approval   if anyone can clear up these discrepancies  i would appreciate
