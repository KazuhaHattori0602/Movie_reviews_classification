this movie attempted to make stu ungar s life interesting by being creative  what they forgot is that his life was plenty entertaining enough on it s own without having to make things up   a short list of the inaccuracies      stuey was not sent straight to las vegas for a gin tournament to pay off old debts  he spent a good deal of time in florida first  and only went to las vegas when he ran out of gin games on the east coast     stuey never associated  or played gin  with a casino executive  like the one played by pat morita in the movie      there was no magical turnaround in the buildup to the   wsop  in fact stuey barely made it into the tournament as it was  he snorted cocaine the week before even   either tell the story right  or don t tell it at all    out of   stars for michael imperolli s credible performance  the only redeeming quality of this movie
