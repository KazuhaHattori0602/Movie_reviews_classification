this is a new approach to comedy  it isn t funny   the joke is that this  in and of itself  is supposed to be funny   the story is based on a french short story  located in paris  and the characters have french names  louis aubinard  for example   played by   bob hoskins  the movie also stars the equally french jeff goldblum and natasha richardson  the situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those carry on movies from years back   i believe these are also jokes   to cast these actors who make no attempt to act french in any way  to have them cavort in the manner of broad english dance hall comedy  and to leave the whole bloomin  mystery unexplained to the audience   in the humour department  this is practically the algonquin round table  isn t it   the movie tries to be charming and quirky  and i guess these characteristics are sort of funny  not as funny as duck soup or love and death  perhaps  but funnier than the deer hunter or the battleship potemkin   it is an example of personal filmmaking  it makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience  but stays true to its premise and its internal logic  although all the situations are unbelievable  they are logical within the film s own bizarro world   i generally like this kind of eccentric movie  but i found this one to be paced too slowly  to be dull witted  tedious  and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit  it just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways  and wastes some wonderful talents along the way  it has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars  who are all otherwise distinguished players  i found it to be the biggest waste of talent since the betsy  and i wish i had never seen goldblum and hoskins in this thing   so  call it an interesting miss  and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill
