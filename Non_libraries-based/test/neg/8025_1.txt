after hearing that some of the people behind the low budget flicks  terror in rock n roll  nsj n  and  it came from outer space  and stuff  were involved in making this movie  i decided to buy it unseen on dvd  i wish i hadn t  the other movies were funny  tongue in cheek and kinda stupid  while kraftverk   is devoid of any humor at all  and it is so god awful that i m getting angry just thinking about it  the worst actors possible  the worst script possible  the worst special effects available  and the most unsexy sex scene ever  uhhh  and the whole thing goes on for   hours and   minutes  please  do not ever make another movie
