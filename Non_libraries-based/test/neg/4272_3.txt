i always try not to be harsh while criticizing something that i didn t like  but after watching this mini series i was so disappointed that could not help my irritation  on the one hand  it is true that series stayed faithful to the novel and of course i found that very nice  but on the other hand terrible casting  poor acting  especially of key characters   like funny price  impression of stage play  i mean theatrical way of acting makes you irritate from the beginning to the end  i am sure with this budget  even if it was low  could have been done something much better and worthwhile  it is up to you to watch this series  but personally i don t advice you to spend your time on this disappointing ecranization
