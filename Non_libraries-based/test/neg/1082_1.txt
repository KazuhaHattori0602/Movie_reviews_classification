well  how to start  i saw the italian job for the first time some years ago and visiting a rental shop i couldn t quite remember why i had a bad feeling about it  now i do   after voting for the ratings for this film i saw the statistics  apparently this film appeals most to under   girls  no wonder  they didn t pay enough to charlize to flash and i guess some girls magazine has rated mark wahlbergs abs  awesome   other than that this film is completely predictable  the actors are mainly forever b stars and even the good ones are being misused horribly  the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine this  it even manages to repeat itself without doing a sequel  the first   minutes are the best part of the film and it s all downhill from there and once they figured this out they decided to use the finest hour again in the end repeating to detail their gold heist  all in all  lots of noise about nothing   i think charlize theron is good and ed norton could be more as he s been before  apart from donald sutherland s  look  i m here too  appearing in the beginning i d say this movie ought to have a  pass if you re above   all over it
