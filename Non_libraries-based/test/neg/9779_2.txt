i gave this movie   instead of   just just because i am a polite person  this movie made me loose   minutes of my life in which i could have done something useful for the human kind or just me    the dialog is poor  the actors never look scared  even if it s supposed to be a horror movie  for example the scene in which kurt collects the bones of his former colleague  he should be frightened  but he looks quite normal  the chick of the movie is such a clich  the one thing i liked about her is the dress she wore in the final scene and  by the way  the end was extremely predictable with the cocoon blinking pinkly in the box  as a matter of fact  i was thinking more of an ant walking around on the back seat of the car  but it still didn t surprise me
