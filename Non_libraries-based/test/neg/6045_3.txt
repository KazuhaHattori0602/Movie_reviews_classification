i had seen this movie just days before halloween   i noticed it around lunch time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it  seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv you know  after conan but before the infomercials sorta deal   although this movie has very little to do with webs  it does have a lot to do with spiders  refer to my heading if you need a refresher   i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating  a hidden nuclear generator  a scientist and a believable portal would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after   minutes   the cast is poor with no memorable performances  poor quality queen who has had her breasts amplified considering spiders don t carry breasts  as well as poor sound effects  an obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried   spoiler     electricians stumble upon a hidden nuclear generator while on a job  they fiddle with the buttons and open a portal    workers fall into the portal and it closes scrambling to figure out what is going on  the party still in our world seeks help while the other party observers their surroundings   help does not arrive so they open the portal and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension  they encounter a race of human spiders dubbed soldiers  after a death and chase they are saved by survivors   now it gets boring they hide  talk a bit  try to build another portal then attack the hive  after losing   more electricians they open the portal and escape returning to our world some   million years ago   sounds interesting huh
