sdiner  had clearly not seen the film in decades  and his memory is appalling  his attempts to paint the mark lester shaving scene as suspect are utterly erroneous  as are his incorrect comments about the bad guy  sneaking peeks at the kid s body  lester is clothed for the entire time the man is in the room  and the man barely gives him a glance   the scene is a crude attempt to show lester s innocent curiosity about the man s body   like everything in this film  it s badly done  but nothing more   even sdiner s comments about savalas  character who  casually sent a german family to their deaths by nudging their trailer off a cliff  is nonsense  it was a single woman  she was already dead  and she was in a car   i suggest that sdiner s review says far  far more about his own  far from liberal mindset  than it does about this valueless film   the only reason i even bothered to look it up  was out of curiosity to see if it was made before or after kojak   the film is a worthless piece of  s trash  but sdiner s review of it is the worst kind of slander  he wraps up his review in pseudo intellectual  facts  but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every  factual  matter he discusses   i can only assume that sdiner  saw exactly what he looked for  which is disturbing  now he can return to burning copies of catcher in the rye
