ok  this  horror  film was meant to be a joke  right  please tell me it was supposed to be a joke  then i ll understand   a big cawing bird with giant claws   or one claw  anyway   swoops down on unsuspecting folks on the ground and gobbles them up  mara corday and jeff morrow sufficiently overact in order to keep things interesting  but at least you ll enjoy a hearty snicker when you see the  monster  it looks like a cross between a deranged chicken and mortimer snerd   either director fred sears just made this picture in a hurry and knew the bird looked utterly ridiculous  or he really thought his film and creature were genuinely frightening  i prefer to think   and hope   it was the former   p s  the bird needs a haircut
