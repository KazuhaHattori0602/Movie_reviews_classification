i thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series  after all  part   didn t measure up to part   and this one doesn t have daniel sawn  miyagi s humour wasn t quite as witty in this one as in part   but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching   the girl s part was pretty good  she s a lost teenager who needs direction  i find the plot a little hard to believe  that the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of mr  miyagi  a man she just met  of course  he was a friend of her brother   i did appreciate the monastery  one might think from some of my other reviews that i wouldn t have liked the dancing monks  but i thought it was amusing  it showed that they know how to have some fun  now if these were monks in ancient china dancing to pop music  that would have been another matter   probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn t kill a bug  miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid  nations trying to destroy each other is stupid  but having respect for all life is not stupid  miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well   i give this movie a   out of   sure  there were some things i liked about it  it wasn t as funny as part three  and no character could ever live up to sato in part   this movie has no re watch value  i can t imagine watching it again  but it is worth seeing once
