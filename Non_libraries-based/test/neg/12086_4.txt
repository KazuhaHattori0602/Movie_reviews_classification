despite strong performances by minnie driver and tom wilkinson  this film fails to ignite the imagination of the viewer   by the way  what has become of ms  driver  she had such a potential in the film industry   this to me was almost like an  s version of yentl without the musical fanfare  with the death of her father  driver takes a position as a governess to a christian family  hiding her jewish identity   while i realize that this is a period peace  it was awfully dull even for   england and scotland   the lady of the house is most irritating with that sing song voice of hers  i expected her to refer to driver as dear at any moment  what kind of name is mary blackchurch  i know that driver is trying to pass herself off as a christian  but does this name signify all the way   in the interim  mary finds love with the young charge s father  wilkinson  and his emotionally unbalanced son   in the end  the only thing that we see accomplished is that mary has found a profession to provide for her family photography  did we really have to be subjected to what was happening throughout the film   the early scenes of judaism practiced in  th century england and the cholera epidemic at the end could have been played up more  there is a definite underlying feeling of anti semitism by the wilkinson family but that s never allowed to come out
