first off  i am a huge fan of robert blake  always have been   this movie came on movieplex last night   and the title interested me   of course the star  but after watching it i was left more confused than i was before it started  there are some good scenes  and i thought they would lead somewhere  but they didn t  it turned out to be an  anti cop   anti buddy   anti hippie  pretty much  anti everything movie  with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere   robert blake is great as the lead  well as great as someone could be with this bad movie  i am still a huge fan of mr  blake and love his acting even in crap like this but this drug induced  s tripe  well  better stay away from this one and  that ending  what a pisser
