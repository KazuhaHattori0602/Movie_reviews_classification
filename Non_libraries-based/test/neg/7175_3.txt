this is a bottom of the barrel type of b film from one of the poverty row studios  monogram  in the mid s  the kind that filled out a double bill   only reason i watched was to see what jackie moran was like in a leading role as a page boy at a radio station who attempts to solve a murder  he played phil meade in gone with the wind only two years earlier and this was one of his last teen aged roles  he s no mickey rooney   the script is as hapless as the production values and is full of clich  ridden situations with a cast of uniformly untalented individuals  wanda mckay is the switchboard girl who is  discovered  by a radio producer and sidney miller is the nerdy friend of the hero who s afraid of his own shadow   mercifully  it s over in an hour when the murder is solved after a round up of all the suspects  terribly overacted  the only quiet performance of any interest is given by jon gilbreath as tex  the cowboy  but he bites the dust after too brief an appearance   there are several songs  but all of them are forgettable  as are the lame jokes and dialog
