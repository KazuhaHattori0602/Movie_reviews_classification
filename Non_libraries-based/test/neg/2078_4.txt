before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not  i should inform you i ve never seen another adaptation of carmen  so if you re looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others  this might not be of much use to you   the only time i ve come across carmen was on the car stereo when driving through spain on a family holiday when i was a teenager  i didn t pay much attention to it because i didn t like opera at the time and i didn t know any better  the story has been around for   years or so  do i feel i ve missed out after seeing this movie  yes  mainly due to the plot  but also because if all the actresses who played carmen looked like paz vega  i would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my dvd collection   directed by vicente aranda  who also co rewrote the story with joaquim jord  the story is told through the eyes of the original author prosper m rim e  a french writer making his way through  th century spain  he comes across jos   leonardo sbaraglia  a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with carmen  paz vega  a sultry  sexy  bedazzling gypsy woman  who has the mouth of the devil  the temper of a  toro  and who recklessly leads men to their doom  the moment she meets jos  she is attracted by his stand offish behaviour  but she hooks him  reels him in and lets him go  many a time  until one day  jos  is wanted for murder  carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers  they seem to be settling  she s fallen in love with him  but she meets the charming escamillo  the bullfighter  can jos  hold his jealousy in check  or does it destroy him    it s a beautiful seductive story  something that resembles  almost  a shakespearian or ovid plot  with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character  it s poetic  fiery  and above all  slutty  i was left hanging on  i didn t know which way it was going to turn  i always hoped that jos  might change carmen s dirty little ways  i won t tell you if he succeeded or not   the above synopsis is what i took away from the film  but i was not impressed by the film itself  it was only after i watched it that i dug a little deeper into the story and i realised how much of a missed opportunity aranda had made of retelling m rim e s classic  it was a shallow  slutty period drama blunder  that saw paz vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked  not that i m complaining about this in particular   first of all  the acting was poor  i was not impressed by sbaraglia as jos  i m still unsure whether he was a weak actor or jos  was supposed to be a weak character  i ve not read the book  he s supposed to be a man who with burning desire for carmen  but he spends much of the time looking confused  jealous and a bit dim  paz vega was slightly better as carmen  i was convinced by her hardened  wicked character  although i have seen more convincing performances by her in other films  such as zapping and lucia y el sexo  she seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman  not that i ve come across many andalusian gypsy women  so in a way  the role didn t really fit her  the other actors in the film weren t great either  they seemed to do everything half heartedly  the story is passionate  emotive   they looked half arsed  as if they couldn t wait to get out the tight  th century costumes they were wearing   however  the costumes  i was impressed with   one of the redeeming factors of the film  i like spanish culture  i liked the soldiers  uniforms  the top hats and the women s flamenco dresses  they fitted the time well  that s all i can really say about that  sorry  back to the criticism   the script  as stated above  was co rewritten by vicente aranda and joaquim jord  and done so badly  so much that it would leave m rim e turning in his grave  it was boring  it didn t make best use of jos s intense passion for carmen  or maybe that was just the acting  there were cheesy lines piled upon one and other  satan and devil connotations everywhere  amongst the millions of swear words  i know the spanish are partial for the odd swear word  but the film was littered with puta   whore  in literally every line maybe it was realistic in  th century poverty stricken seville  but the story itself didn t need it   the editing and camera work was dull and ordinary  there was only one bit i actually liked  and that was when the camera follows a fly close up in mid air  which lands on carmen s face  that was good  but the rest  boring   to conclude  it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing  if you re a literature teacher  by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story  however  only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film  thanks to paz vega  otherwise  stick to the opera version  even though i hate musicals  i give this film   just for the fact i love the storyline  and paz vega
