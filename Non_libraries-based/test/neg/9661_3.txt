wow  this movie sucked   this movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot   everything about this movie was awful   the acting was horrendous  every part except the part of the  mexican  sandlot manager was terrible   luke perry  though only bit parts was absolutely awful  this was is worst role ever  even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you d want to punch  even in the end  lol   this movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage  the humor was for   year olds   if your over   and want something worthwhile to watch  skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead
