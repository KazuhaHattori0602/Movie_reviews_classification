following up the  s classic horror film carrie with this offering  is like ford following the mustang with the edsel  this film was horrendous in every detail  it would have been titled beverly hill   meets mystery science theater   but both of those shows far exceed this tripe  this film was scarcely a horror film  i timed about   minutes of gore and   minutes of lame high school hazing and ritual  wow  what a surprise  carrie s weird friend commits suicide  wow  carrie misconstrues her love interests affections  wow  the in crowd sets up carrie  wow  the jocks have a sexual scoring contest  what this film needed was way more action and far less tired teen cliches  this film is totally unviewable
