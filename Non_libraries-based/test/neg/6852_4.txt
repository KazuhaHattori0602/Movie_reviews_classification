this is a painfully slow story about the last days of   when a strange disease breaks out and  i stopped caring  this is suppose to be about two people who live over or under each other in an apartment complex  there s a leak and a plumber put a hole in the man s floor so you can see into the woman s below apartment  also since there is a crisis going on much of the dialog is actually news reports   sounds promising   not really   i became distracted and started doing other things which is deadly in a subtitled film  basically i started not watching  which made events seem even more surreal when i did look up   it may work for you  it didn t for me
