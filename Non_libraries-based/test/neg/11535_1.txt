i absolutely hated this movie  even though the movie wanted to transmit some kind of social message  it was done in such a clich  ridden and melodramatic way like a mexican soap opera   also the acting was terrible especially charityn and her son  that s one of the problems with dominican movies  they use celebrities that can t even act just to attract the masses    i m even more ashamed about the positive reviews here which sadly means dominicans are just being condescending to what s done here instead of giving honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry base itself on quality
