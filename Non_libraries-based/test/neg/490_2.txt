first of all  the genre of this movie isn t comedy  it s more of a drama   i had low expectations on the movie  and still they didn t come up them  as some of the other reviews point out  there are some nice music in the movie  but if you want to listen to good music i suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with bon jovi  or m tley crue  it ll be more quality time   last  if you want to watch a good movie in this rock n roll genre  i recommend  almost famous
