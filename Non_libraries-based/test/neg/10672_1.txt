ego  seems it s the only reason this movie was made  this movie is so wrong in so many ways that it s below one s dignity to write much about it  every character was only good at self praise and lead actors  i use this term liberally as has the director  emote in the likeness of stone  the little story  if that  fails on the basic aspects such as logic  feeling and drama  direction leaves much to be desired  blatant flaws are all over the place  character motives aren t defined  prospective husbands are found overnight  broken car windows mend themselves among other things   let s face it  himesh can t act  neither  it seems  can hansika motwani  in her defense  she s still a chubby child who looks older than she is thanks to tonnes of make up  raj babbar overacts and makes his little presence as fake as possible  darshan jariwala laughs a bit too much  the actor who plays himesh s friend is the only natural    a few questions do come to mind  how can such a film cost rs  where did the money go  granted that one chase sequence was moderately well shot and mallika sherawat was paid an obscene rs  for her   minute appearance and   songs  but the sheer stupidity of the film boggles the mind   including   mumbai auto rickshaws that show up and jump on a police car   the good  himesh shows courage by allowing the film to make fun of his nasal voice and trademark  topi  let s give the devil his due  himesh  as usual gives good music   the bad  direction  story  himesh s singing is still hard to ignore  the ugly  dialogs and everything else   final word  painful in every sense of the word  watch this movie only if you loved subhash ghai s  yaadein
