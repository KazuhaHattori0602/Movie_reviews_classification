words cannot describe how horrible this movie is  well  maybe they can  i ll take a stab at it      pitiful  hollywood makes more talking animals set in graphics  apparently script and storyline aren t needed anymore       violent  kids movie but yet one of the characters is viciously attacked and killed       blatantly stupid  the movie is actually depicting the farm animals as having human abilities  in nemo  the fish could talk  but for the most part  they are still fish  we only hear the english as a translation  in barnyard  the animals are actually speaking english that other people can understand       unintelligent   no smart story line or even any smart humor   ok  the   year old dog on crutches was funny       culturally insensitive   the  black  cow is actually played by a black actress  the pink cow is played by a white actress  the black cow was playing a stereotypical black person       ignorant   no such thing as a male cow that i m aware of  i believe we call them bulls  if we are going to expose our children to drek  it might as well have the simplest facts correct       boring and borish  my   year old had us leave after   minutes  he practically fell asleep   i m sure this movie will make millions  which is unfortunate  because it only proves to hollywood producers that the american public at large is just filled with suckers waiting to pay   bucks just to get some peace and quiet from the kids for an hour or two  an unfortunate circumstance  why should the producers spend real money when the returns will be the same either way
