this turned out to be more of a women s romance soap suspense film than what i hoped it was simply a tense thriller  yes  the final   minutes were suspenseful but much of the previous   bordered on being just plain tedious   ruter hauer was a little too subdued  not playing his normal intense character  natasha richardson sports somewhat of a dumb look most of the time and her character was very unappealing   the story is so so  it s not as bad as i m making out  but it sure isn t anything i d watch again  and the back of the vhs describing this movie was misleading
