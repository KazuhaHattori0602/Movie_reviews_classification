i had always eyed italian horror maestro dario argento s efforts as producer with a certain suspicion and these were only confirmed after my fairly recent viewing of lamberto bava s terrible demons   the fact that this was supposed to be its third installment did not sound promising at all but i decided to give the film a rental regardless now that we re in full halloween swing  i checked out the theatrical trailer on the anchor bay dvd prior to viewing the main feature   the undeniably striking visuals had me intrigued to be sure but  then  the film proper  which makes no more sense than what s presented in that frenzied two minute montage and  in retrospect  can be seen to have wisely compiled most of its highlights  proved a definite let down   opening promisingly enough with a medieval prologue straight out of alexander nevsky   it goes downhill fast because it relies too much on surreal imagery at the expense of narrative  consequently  several characters randomly take center stage throughout   with the insufferable male lead succumbing to the dark forces early on  the sinister looking bishop  feodor chaliapin  resulting a mere red herring  the mysterious black priest gradually assuming heroic qualities  the leading lady is for whatever reason preyed upon by a goat shaped demon  culminating in a sexual rite conducted in front of the other cultists lifted all too obviously from rosemary s baby [ ]  and a reasonably impressive  year old asia argento as the rebellious but likable sacristan s daughter  who emerges as the only survivor by the end  incidentally  the older argento also co wrote the film s story and screenplay along with director soavi and  under a pseudonym after they apparently fell out with dario in the early stages of production  original helmer lamberto bava and prolific genre scribe dardano sacchetti  whom i met at the  st venice film festival in    the extremely muddled second half of the film  then  sees a group of people   including the inevitable teenagers but also a doddering english couple  whose constant bickering is given an amusingly nasty punchline    similarly shut inside a building in the grip of evil spirits  the church being the burial ground of a satanic cult 
not that this horror outing is likely to dispel memories of luis bunuel s sublimely surreal the exterminating angel   you see  in the end  the film is all the more disappointing  though sergio stivaletti s gruesome effects  at least  are notable  given that i had thoroughly enjoyed the only other soavi title i d watched   cemetery man   which i own via the r  se dvd  that said  i d still like to catch his debut feature   stage fright     and the director s follow up effort to the church  entitled the sect
