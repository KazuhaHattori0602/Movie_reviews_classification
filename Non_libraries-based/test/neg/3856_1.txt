a friend of mine who has a mysterious knack for finding and   horrors    liking bad movies recommended i watch  the pest  at the time unaware of just how truly pathetic his taste in movies was  i decided to give it a try   bad mistake   the story  although clearly ripped straight out of any sixth grade english textbook as far as the  manhunter  theme goes  would be amusing under the right conditions   good actors  writer  director  wardrobe  and so on and so on to almost no end  clearly these factors are absent    the pest  is supposed to be funny  i think  i say  think  because i let crack nothing more than a slight smile throughout the whole film  not a guffaw  not a laugh  not a chuckle  not even a grin  a smile  at best  and that happened so rarely while watching this film i even remember how often i did smile   maybe   or   times at best   so do yourself an immense favor  never watch this movie  avoid at all costs
