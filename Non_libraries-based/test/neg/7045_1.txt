can u believe a college professor made this film   the same man who made dhoop  the film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever  the main message is nice but presented badly  the film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes  miscasts etc and bad performances  direction and everything is poor  music is okay  emraan s naughty streak works and he does well tusshar is bad tanushree and isha are bad paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror
