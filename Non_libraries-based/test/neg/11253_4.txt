first off  i am critical of this movie because i really had high hopes and instead  this movie sucked    possible spoilers   if you haven t seen the tv series  where to begin  well  let s start at the quality  the movie was barely better than the original tv series and the two fight scenes were very nicely crafted  however the cgi was horrid   then there is the plot holes and questions that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done  this movie does not close off as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe known as fma and only returns to expand the universe more before leaving us with nothing but our imaginations to decipher what would happen in the future   and then there is the stories biggest fault  adding wwii and hitler  why   the series was perfect  and didn t need hitler  it didn t even need germany   overall the entire movie was sorely lacing in what a true fma movie could have been and if i were the directors  i d scrap cos and make a new  more  ending  ending
