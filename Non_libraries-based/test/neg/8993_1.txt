naach would have won an razzie for the worst film in    may be overall too  if it were global  when it comes acting badly  aka showing attitude yawning over  not  acting  halle berry is no match for antra malli  while the catwoman had storeline  supposedly hot actress in microscopic costume  and some action sequences  naach had nothing at all   one of those movies which makes me wonder why imdb does allow one to rate a movie as   yet again  i think that movie does not even deserve a   it has to be something negative or minus infinity   ok what about the plot outline  it is a funda giving  arrogant  full of attitude choreographer meet an useless  skill less  loafer who aspires to be an actor tale  the story is so short that if just another sentence  imdb might ban me for writing a spoiler  about the story telling  its like a bunch  sorry   people for the most part  of people moving in super slow motion  don t try this movie if you have bought new dvd player  you would end up believing that either dvd is in bad shape or dvd player is struck  not its fault at all   at the end of it all  you end up giving some credits to the director  at least he realized that both antra malli and abhishek bachan  at least at that time  can t speak dialogues convincingly  so there are not too many dialogues in this movie  so  you can at least sleep your way through the movie  with some annoying noises from those antra malli song sequences   do watch this movie if you are new to bollywood cinema  once you have tolerated this movie  you would be able to see any bollywood movie and enjoy it   there can t be worse   hour torture than this
