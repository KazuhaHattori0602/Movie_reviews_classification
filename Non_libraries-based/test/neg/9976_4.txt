fellow giallo fanatics  beware and or proceed with caution 
 for this movie isn t exactly what it appears to be  it surely looks like a giallo  with its juicy vhs cover  showing a busty naked girl and a big bloodied knife  rhythmic title and the names of two veteran italian actors in the cast  john phillip   fernando rey  but it s basically just an erotic thriller without much of a plot  the version i watched is presumably harshly censored   with a running time of barely   minutes   but then still there s a severe lack of suspense  character development and most of all sadistic  and typically giallo  carnage   eyes behind the wall  can briefly be summarized as the gathering of a bunch of perverted characters and the extended depiction of their sexuality issues  it s an interesting effort notwithstanding  because writer director giuliano petrelli  his only film  clearly attempted to do something special  but the overall result is unsatisfying and regrettably tame  inspired by hitchcock s  rear window  the main character is a frustrated elderly and wheelchair bound writer  he and his much younger lover get their sexual kicks from spying on the single male tenant living across the road  the tenant  respectively  likes to perform gym exercises around the house whilst being naked and clearly has bisexual desires  wheelchair guy sends his wife over and they have sex  then  there s also ottavio the butler who repeatedly rapes schoolgirls  are there any normal characters in the story  well no  of course not  the film benefices from a continuously ominous atmosphere  with a moody soundtrack and nifty photography  but none of it ever leads anywhere so it s all just sleaze   sex without significance  there s a truly bizarre twist revelation at the end of the story  but it comes too late and too randomly to boost up the overall quality  not recommended to fans of italian horror cult cinema  but maybe it is great viewing for psychology students  to analyze the characters freud style
