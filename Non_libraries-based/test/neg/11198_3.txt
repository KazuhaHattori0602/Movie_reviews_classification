i went to crooked earth to see a piece of new zealand  what i found was a badly scripted and badly acted echo of the people i know   great moments between characters   including many of temuera morrison and lawrences makoares scenes together   were often ruined by long and wordy monologues that the actors were forced to stumble through  beautiful and ill fitting phrases rattled away from lawrence in particular as if he were the new maori messiah at his pulpit of beer crates   when watching any film with maori actors  i ve found that i can always pick a half dozen characters that remind me of someone in my life  with crooked earth i struggled to find one key character that rung true for the entire two hours  most   including wiremu and peka   wound up saying or doing things that i didn t understand and couldn t connect with  by the end of the movie the writer had succeeded in alienating the audience where the maori weren t able to relate to it and the pakeha were therefore given license to dismiss it  my feeling is that the movies message   or at least the main one of several that was being lobbed at the audience   is important enough to avoid using character extremities  unfortunately  no one who read the script before it was filmed thought to pass this piece of advice on   the soundtrack was invasive  and  as irritating as that horrible `bing bong  noise that they laced through `eyes wide shut  the audience was not so subtly auto cued to laugh  cry or be angry when the music changed  it reminded me of darth vader s entrance music in star wars  obvious and mildly amusing   i think that there are some people out there that might enjoy this film  it s funny in parts  has a fair amount of action and has some really powerful scenes  calvin tuteao and quentin hita did bang up jobs as well  as a whole though  i didn t enjoy the experience as much as i know i should have  barb wire  speed   the island of dr moreau and crooked earth look like they re going to be tem s quartet of crap
