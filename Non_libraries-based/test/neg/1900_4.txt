this was one of christie s later stories  throughout her long career  she was interested in the shifting narrative and the notion of conflicting agents  both are essentially the same thing and boil down to questions of who it is that controls or creates the situation   in detective fiction  the game is a matter of conflicting realities  the murderer intends to change reality to fool the detective  the writer intends to do the same to the reader  both the reader and the detective are in similar battles to create what they see  that s why her stories often include a writer   in her works  she explores every combination of tricks she can think of that deal with this  along the way  we often have bodies that are not who they seem  and times  and intended victims and such  but the real magic of the books is this notion of control  in  bertram s  it was literally a building   here  it is a dead man  well  sometimes that happens  but not like this  it is as if the writer were the famous mr  rafiel  this is particularly sweet to marple readers who remember this same character from the  carribean mystery  which in a way was also framed by her nephew  in that story  rafiel was the conveyor of the story to the authorities   the producers of this series have an almost wacky commitment to using a different creative team on each one  sometimes it produces bland work  the  bertram s  episode was rather brilliantly staged  this one is the most lavish of the lot  and has an active camera  but unlike the  bertram s  work  it has nothing to do with the story   the camera moves and captures merely because it can  the  citizen kane  quote at the beginning was a little too literal and blunt  this story is good  but the adapter took out some pretty critical stuff  and that irrelevant camera annoys   ted s evaluation     of   has some interesting elements
