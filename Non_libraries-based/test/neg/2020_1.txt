my goodness  and here i thought that there were no directors worse than uwe boll   imagine the number of decisions necessary to produce a motion picture  conceptual approval  scriptwriting  dialogue editing  casting  set and prop design  location selection  acting  timing  cinematography  lighting  music  sound and video editing  direction   now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong   result  dracula    for a film supposedly set in the  s  this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta flick of the  s  the set is ridiculous for the period  the dialogue is atrocious  the timing of each scene is ludicrous  the acting is beyond abysmal  everything stinks   let s just take props  for example  if you have a movie set on a space freighter built in   how likely is it that it will have the exposed piping and hydraulic doors of a  s era oil tanker  what  technology hasn t changed in   years  the  professor  uses a standard tandy keyboard and radio shack flipswitches to  reprogram  the computer  what  they haven t figured out voice control yet  of course  the prof is tethered to a wheelchair  with wheels  even though  you know  they ve got intergalactic hyperdrive but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair  much less a floating one  or bionic legs or something  and apparently this freighter was carrying an intergalactic consignment of rosewood caskets  how convenient  then there are the weapons   the crew carry standard late  th century firearms  in a ship  in the vacuum of space  where one bullethole would kill them all  nice planning there  prop department   oh  why go on
