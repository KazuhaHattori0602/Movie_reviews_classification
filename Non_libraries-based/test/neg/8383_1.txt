this film is a nightmare  the sensation you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same i got when i finished watching this movie   uff
ok  it ended  what a relief  i felt pain watching this movie  so bad it was  it s a b series low cost movie  that s for sure  but i think it not an excuse to be so bad  i ve watched brilliant low cost movies  with nice plots  nice production  nice acting  and most of all  some substance  this one got nothing of it  the plot is hilarious  it almost seems like an  american guide about how to transform ancient chinese mythology into a ridiculous teenage movie  with some kids playing with the occult 
 i don t know if the chinese tale present in this movie is real or not  but if it is  the  damage  is even worse  the production is just horrible  a plain zero  what  special effects  are those  there s no suspense  the supposed  tension scenes  are a complete failure  the acting is not better  and what about the dialogs  oh my god  a movie which has for several times dialogs just like   i will pass there later  ok  is that alright    ok  alright    ok    ok  alright  bye then 
 i m sure it doesn t deserve more than a   score   too bad to be true
