like almost everyone else  i became aware of this turkey on mystery science theater   it easily ranks as one of my favorite mst k episodes of all time  i really couldn t imagine attempting to watch this film on it s own though it s really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really  really bad   miles o keeffe stars as ator  a muscle bound fabio wannabe who lives during the time of cave men  we the viewer are asked to suspend our disbelief in that he knows alchemy and chemistry and can manage to build a complete hang glider in about   minutes  yeah  right  there s also a fairly attractive actress  can t remember her name  who wears a hub cap as a chest shield  oh  and i can t forget that wacky asian side kick thong  he had the easiest role in the movie since he doesn t utter one word of dialogue throughout the entire movie  he had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking and he failed miserably   the film isn t watchable in any way and should be only viewed in it s proper mst k format  if you watch that version  you ll laugh yourself silly    i m huge   rating
