first of all  this movie is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it  since i myself did not understand this horrible story  further  the unknown cast  leaded by an actress called laura mennell  is simply awful  the expressions and screams of the character sara tobias are laughable and ridiculous  confusing grimaces with acting  last but not the least  there are many favorable reviews about this flick in imdb as follows     top notch  can t wait to see more of the directors work   the author has only one review in imdb on   september      incredibly shot  amazingly intense   the author has only one review in imdb on   august       not your typical blood and gore  in fact better      the author has only one review in imdb on   february      as intense as asian horror    the author has only one review in imdb on   november    coincidence  or are they the parents  relatives  friends or people hired by the production to promote this crap  my vote is three   title  brazil      a nova profecia      the new prophecy
