for most people  robocop   is the film that really is the big disgrace for the robo series  it has few fans  and most people hate it for it s shameless commercial pg  approach  now  i m not going to say that robocop   is any good  frankly  it pretty much sucks  but as far as being a properly shot and executed film  it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos  yes  the truth of the matter is that robocop   is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near masterpiece  so what if robocop   turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy   at least it s doing it openly  i don t know where robocop   begins and ends  i don t know what or whom it s about  i don t understand what s going on in it  i don t understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren t  i will go insane if i try to understand the characters  i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying  i can t believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i can t believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see  he probably didn t by the way  neither miller  nor weller nor allen did  it s not hard to see why   now  robocop   has it s fans  i know this  mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti pretensions  dismissing anybody who expected any depth  or subject matter from the first film  as academic roger ebert sith apprentices  it s just a lot of fun  a good piece of action and great entertainment  the argument goes  yeah well  i guess if you just don t listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller  don t get me wrong  i like a good action film  with pure entertainment value as it s only   most satisfying   virtue  but robocop   sir  ain t no such thing   look at the first couple of scenes  this horrible actor makes robo repeat that he s just a machine  and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man  where after murphy s wife  who s suing ocp for robot stalkings  walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him  and then is never heard of again  i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene  because every one has these kind of absurdities in them  it s like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay  the characters act totally random and first say this  then say that  ocp wants to stop crime with a new robo  especially this drug called  nuke  but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city   politics are abandoned i guess  understandable given the comic relief mayor  the villain  played by tom noonan  who did a better version of this in last action hero and that s saying a lot  is an addict  but is still used for this machine  the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand   speaking of twelve year olds  this film has the infamous role of  hub  this mad kid who swears and kills people  played by a child actor  i m not going to be all moral about it  it s a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie  go for it  i don t know how much of frank miller s original vision was put into this  but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the  story  and  if i zoom out  i could see this as being quite a cool character  it s grim for sure  to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of robocop and who would be surprised  this whole business with the ocp trying to become this giant monopoly over everything  is properly dystopian and good as well  also  the idea of robocop getting in touch with his wife and kid  having them embedded into the story somehow   would also be great  and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a robocop sequel   but  of course  these are just ideas  as many people have already said  the screenplay is   mess  the kid has one scene  the torture scene  where it s hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid  and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol  tin head  why doesn t he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath  isn t that what his character would do  does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed  not necessarily  given that his last words are  it sucks  so why  it really makes no sense  and this can be said about everybody  no everything  in this film  is there a strike in the police force  is robocop machine or man  what s the deal with turning robo into this community service machine for   minutes  i mean  sure  it s pretty funny i wouldn t deny that  but why build it up  and then discard it  and why the hell is allen so criminally underused  and what is it weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah  well  the threads are many and the mess is enormous   this review is just as messed up as the film  the only reason i give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film  i m sure they had good intentions with it  i mean it s something somewhat stable  some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making
