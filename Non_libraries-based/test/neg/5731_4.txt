it is sad that schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production  especially considering the fact that he had not yet come into his own  and was still as stiff as cardboard in his dialog delivery   actually  this isn t as bad as some critics say  but it isn t good  either  it is amusing  and does play like a poor country cousin of the conan line  making it a conflicted  uneven  poor work  and speaking of poor  the quality is terrible  due to the era in which this was filmed  but that is not the only reason   the story herein is inferior  even to the conan line  but moreover  it loses itself in the  red sonja must be dominated by big strong schwarzenegger  ploy  and entirely forgets its purpose  if it ever had one   it s entertaining  but in a low budget  guilty pleasure  b  kind of way   it rates a   from   the fiend
