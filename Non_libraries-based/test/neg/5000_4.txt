zombie movies are hot  i love  em  can t get enough  why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation  i just really love zombies  surprise  this really isn t much of a zombie movie  low budget i can handle  being duped just irritates me   a group of horror film clich s hold up in a warehouse lab who knows what to escape a fire storm outside  panic  yelling  low light  and  eventually  zombies ensue   i kind of feel bad for the film makers  as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good  a serious  scary horror film  it isn t  far from it  it s a boring mess of wooden acting  cheesy fx  poor lighting  excessive dialogue  and over editing   things first go awry when it takes a good   minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on  it gets worse when another   minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on  all of this is littered with non acting and bad dialogue   finally some one gets attached  not by a zombie though  and hope flickers just a touch before the characters are again lounging around whining  the only emotion any one every generates  about how much this sucks  me too guys  me too   finally zombies are in the mix  but no one watching cares any more  i think there was some blood and gore tossed in  but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice  and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the pointlessly  cube  inspired ending   i will give credit for trying very hard  even if it failed miserably  that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used   can t really recommend this to anyone  save for film students looking for  no no  pointers
