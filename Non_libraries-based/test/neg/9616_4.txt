 spoilers   spoilers  what s going on here    barbara hershey  looking decidedly unsexy   as if she d stolen her granny s spare wig   puts in an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man she has had an affair with  in self defence  after hitting her forty odd times with an axe   like lizzy borden  she is acquitted but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a supposedly  innocent  defendant i have ever seen   lizzy borden took an axe and gave her father forty whacks when she saw what she d done   she pleaded self defence  i don t think so  i find the defendants guilty of screening an unconvincing portrayal and have no alternative but to award this film a sentence of   out of    which would have been lower but for the previous good behaviour of some of those involved
