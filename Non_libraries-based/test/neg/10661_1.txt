this movie has to be the worst film of   it was just really bad and i don t think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad  i mean the don t make really bad hollywood films do they  hamish really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just can t act at all  god he was just so bad  i mean he was that bad in the film that he made mallika sherawat look like a better actress than him  as for her performance  she plays the same role in every movie  god it is just so boring watching her  i mean what do men see in this woman  yeah she has a god body but where is that talent  i have not seen it yet and at this rate i don t think that i ever will   anyway hamish falls in love with ria now this   year old girl can act  my god she was the best actor in the film and she does not look   at all  to me she looks about   but her performance was brilliant in the film  bless her she was really good  i hope to see more of her in the future  so ria falls in love with himash  but her father wants her to marry someone else  a typical bollywood film anyways there is a hiccup  can only happen in a bollywood film  and the both get married in the end   well i would give th music   it was superb  that made the movie a hit  the songs were truly amazing and brilliant  anyways the only thing that i can say is to go and buy the music and not watch the film
