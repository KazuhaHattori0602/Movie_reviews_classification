i liked the understated character that laura linney played in  love actually  and she is very good in  man of the year   but wow  robin williams doesn t give that much of a performance  with a couple of minor exceptions this was weak  laura linney may not have been miscast  but either the editing raped her character  or this was just a sad performance by director barry levinson   and i think it was barry levinson that got old  so many weak performances  such uneven results have to be the fault of management   christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles  goldblum plays a sinister side with relish  and walken s combination of entertainer s manager and commentator for the film is wonderful   but the story is clich  the presentation looks like it could have  should have  been a very good picture  and too many actions are half hearted  the pacing  story  and direction all come up weak  compared to  say  head office   spoof of  secret of my success
