it s boring   it s slow   where are the nasty and brutal murders  where is the tension that is supposed to scare us  this is like watching sesame street without the funny characters of ernie and bert or grover   it s really lame   maybe it was the writing maybe the direction maybe the acting  maybe the editing  maybe the cinematography  maybe the special effects  maybe the makeup   maybe all of the above brought this to something barely able to keep your eyes focused on   i wanted to get scared not bored   this didn t scare me it didn t even interest me i had more fun watching the time on the microwave instead of watching this film   don t bother to buy it and if you see it on television by some freak chance  there is no need to tuck the kids asleep
