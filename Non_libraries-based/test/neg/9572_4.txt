i had to lower my rating of this movie to a   due to the terrible sound track  i m pretty sure it was not a problem with me or the tape  because some actors and the sound track sounded great  but most of the actors voices were distorted or garbled beyond recognition  especially for non brits   there are plenty of cute little twists that would make this an enjoyable movie   ending up in bosnia by mistake is great   but much of the humor was lost in the sound
