i took my   year old twins to see this movie today and i would not recommend it for children their age    this movie had many fighting scenes throughout it  which i found too violent and my children found scary    the subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards children   i was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this  but it just did not cut it  if you have children under   years old  i would not recommend this movie   also  the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie
