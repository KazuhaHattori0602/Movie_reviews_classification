an awful film  badly written  badly acted  cliched  hackneyed  dross  the premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire  it is a curious mix of a bad  s randolph scott b movie and a bad  s spaghetti western  the villains are cardboard  the flashbacks laughable  the dialogue excruciating   the deliberate anachronisms  such as  victorian  rap singers and modern swear words like  motherf er  are irritating to the extreme   a frankenstein monster that died on the lab table
