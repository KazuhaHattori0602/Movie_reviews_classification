i unwittingly walked into this  trap  of a movie   if i could turn back time or simply get a refund i would be happy   it was  pm and cinderella man didn t start until  pm so i rushed into the theater to catch the movie that started at  pm and i dare say god reached out his hand  or retracted it  and allowed me to punish myself for my film gluttony by sitting in for this film   it may be unfair to criticize a movie that was not targeted at my heterosexual male cohort  however  there is no excuse for lousy sound and video editing  this movie was at most worthy of a highschool project budget and i think i ve seen better in those play acting french shorts that we used to do about louis laloupe   maybe it s because i m canadian and this film was for the la fudge packing crew and their sympathizing dames  woe was me when i realized that then entire audience save me cracked up at all the jokes and entendres i fully understood the hinted humor but i just could not relate   this show did show me  supposedly  how gay men date and build relationships  however  even if it was their purpose of the movie  i feel that the  gayness  was focused on too heavily the humanity seemed lacking but again  maybe that was the point simply to be avant gard and to make a splash   i guess with a low budget and poor equipment  you have to make your movie as  loud  as possible in order to get crowds and cash return  i really wish i had simply read my sheldon van auken instead  hehe i was totally the wrong audience
