oh  the horror  the unspeakable horror of this film  if you can even call it a film  this looks like some first year art school project  hastily cobbled together   the  talents  here will subject you to a painful mix of under  and  overacting  and practically all the scenes were terribly contrived and pretentious   the film in no way reflects malaysian culture or social conventions   nobody even talks that way over here  i live in malaysia  btw   spinning gasing seems tailor made to pick up an award in the foreign film category of some western film festival  and unfortunately  that ploy seems to have worked  some reviewers would no doubt describe it as  exotic  but a more accurate word would be  atrocious
