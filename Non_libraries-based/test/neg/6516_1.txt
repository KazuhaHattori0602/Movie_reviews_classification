if you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future  go on and watch the movie   it is a nice fantasy movie with well done cgi  nice acting  a beautiful environment and an above average fantasy story   if you have read the book like me about   times or more and really love it  don t expect too much  or better  don t expect anything at all  the story is totally different from the original book  this may explain that the movie is voted   from people around   or more  like me  and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing   most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting  in my opinion much to the worse      the magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects   changing weather  creating illusions  transform into animals    in the movie the magic is more like  jedi school for the middle ages   tm   wooden sticks instead of lightsabers  that the devil is looking like emperor palpatine  after part iii  doesn t make it really better     the mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie  in the book the story is set near dresden  which krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities   this part might have been changed to cut costs  i also don t understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains     the whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style  lots of mud everywhere  dirty faces  not an orderly kitchen  only very rough houses  the book never suggested such an environment     in the book the master tries to make krabat his successor but krabat rejects  krabat is somewhere between admiration  distance and silent rejection  in the movie krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy     the movie is set in   instead of around   this makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around  x  ok  the stories are missing anyway in the movie   also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes      in the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work  this explanation is missing in the movie  sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy     the book explains why only a few  gesellen  try to confront the master  if the master dies by any mundane reasons  the  gesellen  are free and keep their magical powers  if the master dies at the confrontation  all will lose their power forever
