greetings all   isn t it amazing the power that films have on you after the  st viewing    i was so delighted by the first viewing of this film  i couldn t stop talking about  flatliners  to all my friends for weeks   mind you i was a very impressionable   year old back then and my taste in films have become a little more conservative since then   then somehow i forgot about this film until i saw the dvd in my local department store and remembering how great it was i thought  right   i ll pluck you off the shelf when they bring out the special edition   last week  i was overjoyed when my best friend invited me over to watch flatliners on dvd  the expectation was that i would love this film even more on  nd viewing  how wrong i was    verdict  after   years my view on this film had changed from a very scary  st class movie to total junk which overplays on the religious and supernatural side of things ratherly superficially   i have never been a big fan of julia roberts  acting  excepting for erin brockeridge in which she deserved her oscar  i think the problem with this film definitely lies with the director and a so so mediocre script  i left this film feeling it had no real substance or potential  and just a couple of scarey cheap thrills which weren t very well done at all  not even the score by james newtown howard  who i rather like as a film composer  could captivate and thrill me   in   i would have given this film       but in   i d be lucky to give it       at best
