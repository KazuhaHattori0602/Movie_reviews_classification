being an american service member please believe me when i say that this movie in no way accurately portrays the emotional state of our soldiers sailors airmen marines returning from deployments   that being said   this movie is one large steaming pile of clich  the acting as awful  with the exception of the little girl  the character s backgrounds are weak and laughable  and plot is ludicrous   this movie is so bad i made an account with imdb just to warn anyone with half a brain away from it   canadian writer director francesco lucente should be really  really  really ashamed of this movie  if he disagrees with us foreign policy  he should write a letter to the us government  not punish the entire english speaking world with a monumentally crap film
