i do not generally appreciate light weight attempts at creating humourous stories  which means that  anita no perd el tren  cannot score very high for me  the story is good  a middle aged but still good looking woman finds a new love  but the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical    rosa mar a sard  has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as  amic amat   qv   todo sobre mi madre   qv   las amargas l grimas de petra von kant   qv  and  el embrujo de shanghai   qv  however the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff  for the cinema and for tv  something similar could be said of jos  coronado  perfectly able to produce serious performances  mar a barranco belongs safely in this grouping   such that  in the end  i was left with the feeling that i would be real pleased to see a new making of this film  in a serious tone  which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills  and the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors  wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed
