clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands  but given uwe boll s track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farce   the first   minutes are classic monster movie madness   even the horrible one liners delivered by gi joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genre   you will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point  you ve already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent history   next  enter absolute rubbish talent  the leading man has the same amount of charisma that you will find in garden slug   there is an awkward bit of contrived romance thrown in   this feels so wrong that you can only speculate why this scene was conjured up in the first place  normally the genre uses interludes of romance and nudity to inject some humanity and sympathy into otherwise cardboard cut out characters   here it backfires on all cylinders   the effects are bad and the action unbelievably boring  where other classics show originality and imagination in the face of budget restraints   here it just seems like everything was spent on catering   there are in fact no redeeming features here   not even the  it s so bad it is almost good  applies  it s just bad  and in a bad way   our hero questions the leading starlet about the night they spent together and how she would rate him  she gives him   out of   i give the whole affair    i d have gone for   if that were possible   don t waste your time on this dribble  there is plenty of crap cinema out there  which exceeds this ridiculous rumble in the jungle   oh and finally  the movie has little to nothing at all to do with the popular game far cry  at best it is extremely loosely based on it   horrible  move along
