playmania is extremely boring  this is the basis of the show  mel or shandi ask extremely easy questions that a   year old could answer at an extremely slow pace  this show lasts for   hours and they probably only play about   games in that period  people may like this show because the hosts are eye candy  but they re hotness completely is destroyed by the fact that they are so friggin annoying   during the show they mention that we need more players a million times  the top   surveys that they do probably takes about   minutes out of the show  this show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made  one of the reasons they probably don t have callers is because the show is so cheap with the money  the most money i ve ever seen them hand out was   i wouldn t be surprised if this  game show  is canceled by the end of
