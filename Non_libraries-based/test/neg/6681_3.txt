i got interested in this movie because somebody had made a beautiful video for bj rks  bachelorette  with clips from it  so i watched the movie  and it is indeed stuningly beautiful  a masterpiece of animation   unfortunately  the story doesn t keep up  it starts out well  with interesting plotlines about people fencing for the possession of the rose bride  but suddenly elevators fill up with water and looses their walls  people float away  and finally for no reason whatsoever  utena is tranformed into a car  and a highspeed chase ensues   i like much anime for it s ability to make alternative universes  but this universe is just stupid  if you are gonna watch this movie  turn of the sound  it s better that way
