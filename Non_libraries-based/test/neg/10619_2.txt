now this is a bad movie if i ve ever seen one  in one of film s greatest years    detroit rock city contends with runaway bride and wild wild west for the bottom spot in a barrel of junkies  the plot is masterful  four scrawny high school youngsters finally have their chance at seeing the hard rock theatrics of kiss for
the third year in a row  so when their tickets are toiled by an ultra religious  chain smoking mom  the pals scramble themselves in getting to detroit  and i m sure you can figure out the rest   well  not exactly  the movie does go to extreme measures in explaining how the four band members  no  not gene  paul  ace and peter  go about getting these tickets  losing your virginity in a confessional  saving a smoked out bimbo and your mom s volvo  from the soprano s steve schirripa  nonetheless  preventing a robbery in the midst of botching one for a  year old s debt  and of course  stripping down to your bare essentials for mc ron jeremy after shuttling a full blender with bourbon leftovers  sounds funny  doesn t it  perhaps detroit rock city does have a point with all this tomfoolery in how extreme sometimes these fans can go  and we do understand this movie is a comedy  it is supposed to be filled with slapstick  but does detroit rock city aim to the proper audience  it is rated r  meaning the only way prepubescent adolescents the audience as i see it  to which many will eventually hail this one a classic will voyeur is through illegal terms   detroit rock city also fails at giving itself the late s touch  the camera s texture quality is way too clear and way too bright  missing the necessary flair from films like this is spinal tap and sid   nancy  this would ve allowed audiences to feel `more at home  with the times  simply costuming kids into pre s grunge wear and settling others into `disco infernos  does not do the trick  environment does mean something you know  i doubt detroit looked this glamorous in   if there s anything positive coming from this movie it s the kick ass soundtrack of hard late  to early s rock  van halen  ac dc  you name it  it s all here  of course we can t forget kiss  the band aptly subjected throughout   what the film noticeably fails to manage are questions concerning why the knights of satin s service  it s really just kiss  were so frowned upon by moms around the nation  sure  the loud rock and devilish makeup might be a part of that  encouragements for youth to explore themselves and have a good time might be fair reasons as well  but  what is kiss saying in the music we hear throughout the film towards this highly rebellious group  what separates these anthems of `rock[ing] and roll[ing] all night and partying everyday  from the rest of the music  most likely  these questions will remain in a music communication class and not in the films that should answer them  simply because it is kiss and they rock and we must do everything in our god forgiven power to see them     stars
