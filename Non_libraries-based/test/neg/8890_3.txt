 the quickie  tells of a decadent russian mob family who lives in malibu and well  frankly  this awful attempt at drama isn t worthy of commentary   jason leigh introduces herself to mr  mob guy as being from  pacific exterminators  with huge letters in plain sight on her back which say  west coast exterminators  eventually the mob guys get suspicious because she was exterminating in a bedroom   duh   in another scene mr  mobguy plays russian roulette giving a hooker   to bet whether he ll live or die  she has   chances out of   of keeping the money if she bets  live  well  she bets  die   double duh  later she complains it wasn t fair and wants to play again   triple duh   the list of flaws just goes on and on while this intelligence insulting film stinks and sinks in a quagmire of lousy music  mediocre camera work  poor direction  boring story  etc  pass on this loser   d   note   the barebones dvd which i rented had no english same language subtitles or closed captions
