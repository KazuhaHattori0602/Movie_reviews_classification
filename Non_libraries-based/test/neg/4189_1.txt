this is by far the worst ever  horror  movie  no  make that any movie  i have ever watched  shame on block buster for even carrying this type of crap  i never ask for a refund on any movie  but i think this will be a first   the movie is so bad that i had to stop after just   minutes of watching it   i had more fun watching any of the fuzzy youtube movies than watching this piece of dropping   the marketing dude for this movie must have some type of silver tongue to move this thing into an establishment as blockbuster
