please re watch all   series and do not go see this movie  the trailer is completely misleading and the   weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out  min tv episode into the most painful  hrs of my life  truly an awful film  tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins  micky has   line  and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns  also mr briss s accent just changes about   times in the film tons of badly acted extras  and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for   hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap batman and robin all is forgiven
