good lord   i m going to say right off the bat  i only watched   minutes of this movie  as i am a hardcore eraserhead fan  the  what  you can t watch a wierd black and white movie with little to no dialogue  defense does not apply  i simply can t watch terrible weird black and white movies with little to no dialogue   this movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget  and let him her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible  it was clear from the start that this film should have been   minutes long  assuming it should exist at all  shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes  because the director has  i just love the sound of my own voice  syndrome  and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed  from the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of  god   the opening scene of the film  joy  i knew it was only a matter of time until i turned off the tape  after at least   minutes of a different corpse being pulled around  twitching  on a rope  by a gang of cloaked mystery men  i knew it was time to give up  rarely do i give up on a movie  i sat through the entirety of blair witch   book of shadows  albeit not happily  this did not deserve the   minutes i gave it   if you re an eraserhead fan  do not let simple minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash  allow me to refer you to tetsuo  the iron man  for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness
