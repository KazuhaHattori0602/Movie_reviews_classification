 spoilers ahead  but that shouldn t matter since i hope you wont see this one anyway   if you planned to see this one i have to strongly advice you not to  because this was one of the most wasted   hours i ve experienced   first of all  this is an complete rip off of the great movie  battle royale  it is as stupid as watching any lame american tv show like  cops  or  candid camera   the plot are totally predictable  one challenger pregnant and another is a nurse  anyone doing some logic thinking understands in the beginning what should happen between those   the concept is ripped as mentioned before and the movie lacks the violence necessary of making this movie enjoyable  i mean  the preggo shoots a guy in the back and no blood or not even any trace of the hit in the back   i could go on forever without finding anything good about it  so take your money and get a copy of battle royale instead of watching this piece of crap     out of   too bad i couldn t rate it lower  almost makes scream   a masterpiece
