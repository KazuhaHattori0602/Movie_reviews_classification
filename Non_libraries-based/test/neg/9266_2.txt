my grandad gave me this dvd  with friends like these  the front cover looked quite scary thought i d watch it  what a bloody mistake   basically the film follows three people on a bus and what happens to them involving friends   the first one is about a guy who buys a car that talks to him  the second is a about a guy who wakes up to find a cassarole clone in his fridge  and the third is about a woman who does online dating but it turns out he has a robotic arm   the dvd case rated this film   but even a   year old can watch this and not be scard or entertained  the film should be rated   for slight scares and the swear word bloody   all in all this film is utter shite don t go near it
