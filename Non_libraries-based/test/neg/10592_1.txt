the mod squad isn t a movie  it s a void  that s the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching   i d never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before  it s a film without any reason to exist whatsoever  seemingly consciously designed to appeal to no one as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike  there is no plot  there is no characterisation  there are no set piece action scenes  there aren t even any scenes as such  just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at   frames per second  i m not talking about empty as in dumb summer blockbuster but empty as in  we haven t got the pages yet so just point the camera at something and stop when you ve got   minutes worth  it makes you appreciate the  artistic achievements  of charlie s angels and s w a t  that much more  what it does offer is far too much of giovanni ribisi at his most tediously execrable doing his bastard son of a thousand morons impersonating marlon brando method acting routine  michael lerner dancing with omar epps and
 no  that s it  oh  clare danes has a nice smile in one shot  and dennis farina has the sense to get killed off early  genuinely the most utterly pointless film ever made  it s like l humanite without the jokes but  you know  for kids
