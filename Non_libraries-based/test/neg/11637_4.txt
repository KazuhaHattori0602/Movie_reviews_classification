i enjoy science fiction just as much as the next man
 but what the hell was that  apparently shot over just three days using excess film stock left over from his previous film   nana   this jean renoir short is a bewildering futuristic satire  produced on a budget that couldn t have been much more than zero  in the year   following a great war  africa has become the most civilised region on earth  and what was formerly europe has been designated  terres inconnues  unknown land  an african explorer   played by johnny huggins  a black man dressed up as a white man dressed up as a black man  if you follow me   travels to the ruins of paris in his spherical aircraft  and lands outside the lair of a parisian savage  catherine hessling  then the director s wife  and her primate companion  perhaps the creepiest ape man costume i ve ever seen  the savage  as part of some bizarre sexual initiation ritual  starts showing the explorer the charleston dance  which he is delighted to learn himself   it doesn t help the film that hessling  who was wonderful the following year in renoir s  the little match girl   isn t much of a dancer  though the extensive use of slow motion adds a touch of surrealism to the ceremony  furthermore  i m quite shocked that renoir would exploit his own wife as such a blatant sexual object   it doesn t come as a surprise to learn of their divorce just three years later  on the plus side  i did like the general sci fi concept behind the film  and the slyly satiric touch of the reversing the racial roles usually typical in such stories as this  however  why renoir decided to dress up his black actor as a minstrel will remain a mystery for all of time  silly  crude and quite pointless   charleston parade   is a cinematic oddity from one of cinema s most respected directors  and is perhaps an effort that he would have liked to forget  the dvd version came without a musical soundtrack  but i compromised with a selection of pieces from dmitri shostakovich
