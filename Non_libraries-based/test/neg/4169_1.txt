bad dialog  slow story  scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless  i can t believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film  the directing and acting couldn t save this bomb either     through the movie and you re still waiting for it to start  they lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next   minutes setting up nothing  you watch   minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what  i have no idea   much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull  lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or care   avoid this film at all cost  anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth
