ha ha  first of if you ve never seen a  dimension film  your in for a real treat  known primarily for super low budget horror slasher films   beowulf  was no exception   however  this video was more in the style of ultra cheesy  i missed the k r a f t label on the side   consider the anachronisms   something out of place and time   we had  candles  armour  swords   yet we saw  telescopes  soled shoes  cigarette lighters  loudspeakers  electricity  body bags  aluminum foil tins  and spoons forks    not bad for something that takes place in like the  th century   this is not a horror film  is a horrible film  its very laughable  its really a comedy made to look like a horror film  i couldn t stop laughing   christopher lambert  the highlander series    must have really taken a tumble in his career if he s working for  dimension films   i ve learned my lesson though  i ll be looking at the film studios on the videos  a lot more closely now   rated no reels out of five  if you want a good laugh though  its hard to pass up on this piece of work   this move had some cleavage in spots   i especially liked the blonde bimbette   wayno
