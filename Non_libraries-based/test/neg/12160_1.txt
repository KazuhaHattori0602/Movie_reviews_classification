have seen this movie today  very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist  the most sad things are     it s very slow      how ghengis khan  cruel and mighty emperor of asia can be played by a kind  good actor with warm and lovely eyes   during all the movie except one scene      lot of holes in the plot  there s nothing about how he became the emperor  nothing about where he spend   years between his childhood and mature age  we see an ex slave without money  power  friends or home  click    the very next second he s leading the huge army  without any reasons to be a leader      the magic of ghengis khan arise is kindly explained only by the help of one wolf god whoever it was      can a man make love to his wife that way after not seeing her for years      is it enough to win the sword fight if you just riding your horse through the enemy lines  sitting there with two swords and everybody around you dies  does ridley scott know that way      why after   years khan s mother doesn t look older      what is the motivation for the main character   none  literally   don t waste your time  really  cinematographers s work is good  the nature is outstanding   but the movie cannot be made without director and script  the real ghengis khan would execute director in a second   kind regards
