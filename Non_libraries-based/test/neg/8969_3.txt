any chance to see katharine hepburn in something i haven t seen or from her early movie career is a treat  and on that level the film is amusing  but she s horrible miscast as a hill billy  her famous new england enunciation slips through  making lines like   i d better rustle up some vittles  pretty ludicrous  she s so pretty and so young
 it almost overcomes this major flaw  the story is an old fashioned melodrama  and there fore  a younger generation may think this pretty corny stuff  but this was the staple of american entertainment well into the  s  it has its moments  but you might need to be a die hard movie buff to appreciate it
