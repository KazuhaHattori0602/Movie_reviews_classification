it just so happens that ivan the terrible  parts i and ii both had entries in the   worst movies book by harry medved  now  i do think that declaring they are among the worst movies ever is an overstatement  though they are still both pretty poor films particularly the first one  as it featured more eye rolling and  googly eyed looks  than i have ever seen before  director eisenstein and an awful lot of other people out there thought this made the film  artsy and profound and since i am legally sane  i must say that i hated this first film  the second  while still very incomplete looking  is a vast improvement  as eye rolling is minimal  though overacting and long boring scenes are present in this film just like in part   while part   looks pretty incomplete and needed at least another hour  especially since it never gets to ivan s insane behavior later in life like killing his son and heir while in a fit of anger  since both parts   and   were commissioned by stalin to both excuse his own murderous reign and glorify him  it s no surprise that ivan s life story is left very incomplete  even without all the truly awful behaviors of ivan  apparently the supremely evil stalin still didn t like the film and wouldn t allow its release during his lifetime  maybe he didn t allow this because he was more worried people would see what a huge waste of money and resources the film was instead of seeing stalin as a crazy guy just like ivan    by the way  there was one segment of this tedious film that was just so cool that the film merits a    without it  a  and that s the scene with prince vladimir at the banquet  it is well done and pretty funny in a dark way  and  the scene was done in a russian version of  color technicolor  this is very odd  by the way  because by the mid s  a vastly improved true color process was developed by technicolor that no longer made everything look all orangy red and greenish blue  so  this film during the color sequences looks a lot like a silent or early sound color film  very odd indeed for the  s
