at first sight  i must say already  watch the contractor    with wesley snipes too  a better action movie and with a more dramatic plot   the detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb  set in romania and with awful directing for an action movie  there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom   really  what you expect wesley snipes to do  when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him  don t blame him  he needs the money   this was the first impression when i saw the movie    years ago  but i won t see it again  no way  screw it  it sucks  there  i said it   ps  i don t think i ever said  this movie sucks  on a imdb review  thank you  detonator
