i haven t laughed this much in a long time   or seen a film so ineptly made  talk about so bad it made me laugh   firstly  i estimate that for about   percent of the film s length  i couldn t tell what was happening  or indeed even what i was seeing  i can only describe the camera work as frenetic meets lsd  there are whole segments  minutes long  where all you can see are blurred flashes and fragments of cave wall  people and various other unidentifiable stuff  i spent half the film asking my teenage daughters what was happening  but they couldn t follow it any better than me   then there are the  black  moments  when in an effort to scare us  woooooooo  everyone s lights go out and the screen turns pitch black   and i don t just mean for a few seconds  i think the longest lasted almost two minutes  i guess blank film is one way to keep costs down   i suspect the  director  had recently read a book on all the  must do s  to make a scary movie  and decided to throw them all in   about   times each   there are three good things about this film    it s short at   minutes  though still an hour and a half too long    all the characters die  after all  it s impossible to care about any of them    there was one genuinely good scene   when the group are looking up the shaft they came down  after discovering their rope fallen to the bottom  saw that coming  a large boulder is pushed across the opening  sealing them in  i wasn t expecting that  and it was genuinely chilling   and what s with the early campfire scenes with the shot  after shot  after shot panning from behind the camp lights  i swear the director used almost the same shot about   times in   minutes   and i m positive that after the first kill  the exact same footage of blood on the cave floor is used twice in about   seconds   all in all  a crap piece of film making  i ll watch almost anything  but this is close to where i d draw the line
