i saw this movie  and i do like horror movies   i did not know what to expect  but as soon the movie was on his way it was nice to watch it  the idea was pretty original and the acting was nice  especially jenna dewan as the exciting evil tamara   the hardest thing about horror movies  is to make a good ending  but there the movie failed  for a change  a end scene in a hospital  where suddenly all employees are gone  first you see doctors and nurses running around  but then they all went home   no cries for help while being chased by tamara  escaping to the roof  also a smart move not  and off course a kind of open ending   no the movie started great  the main part was nice to watch  but they really messed up the ending using all clich s from bad horror movies  jeffrey reddick failed in my eyes with this movie  after making some really quality movies like final destination   and    if you like a good horror full of clich  endings  tamara is a good movie to watch  for me  i like movies which surprise me
