patsy kensit and some random australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of art gallery related murders  but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous  the serial killer suddenly isn t important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife  who s basically just a co worker of hers  is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect   tunnel vision  is a really dull  implausible and tension free aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sex thrillers like  fatal attraction   disclosure  and  basic instinct  the characters are extremely one dimensional and pretty much every good cop bad cop clich  is extendedly described in the script  the struggling position of police women in a corps full of men  the shoot first ask questions later mentality  alcohol problems through stress  etc etc
 even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag  yawn  kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable  but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine  the end twist is more or less interesting  not at all original  mind you  but  by then  you stopped caring for the characters a long time already  the scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and clive fleury s directing is completely uninspired  what a total waste of time
