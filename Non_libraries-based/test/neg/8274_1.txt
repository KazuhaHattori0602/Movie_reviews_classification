ok  at the time of writing    people voted for this movie  bringing it to a   out of   rating  my guess is that only the film crew voted  so i m here to bring some justice to it all   never has a movie provoked the audience s intelligence more than this one  given  i laughed out loud quite a bit   but the movie story absolutely didn t want me to   i ve seen a lot of bad movies  a lot  but man  this one blows them all away   speaking   computers  ridiculous acting  and wheelchair chases   and we have young tarantinos who can t get their ideas financed  yup  life s a cruel joke
