you can t really blame the movie maker for glorifying che because the industry is all about money  most of the stories you hear about this  freedom fighter  are absolute tripe fabricated by the communist cuban government after che s death  che was a murdering scumbag from day one  here s a list of the great things che did for cuba   executed thousands of innocent cuban men  women  and children to satisfy his lust for power     destroyed cuba s economy and good standing with the rest of the world  the cuban peso used to be equal with the american dollar  now it s basically worthless     continually failed at all things that involved diplomacy  economy  and the military  he never made it past his first year in medical school  and he was only in one real battle  in which he surrendered with a fully loaded gun     he took over the largest estate in cuba to set up for himself  he had a yacht  a   custom made tv from america  a swimming pool  and a view of the ocean  so much for shunning the materialist life style   cuba today is an absolutely destitute country  and you have no one but che and the castro brothers to thank for it  if you go to cuba today you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas  if you did manage to get out of what you re meant to see  you would find slums  beggars  and prostitutes   if you think any of what i m saying is untrue then go do some studying  compare cuban exports from   to those of today  talk with people who survived or who had parents in the so called cuban  revolution  of the  s  read all of the reports of murdered innocents  read the reports from people who served under che and castro and fled because of what an evil  disgusting human being he was   and please  please  always remember to read or watch everything objectively  stop taking everything at face value and think about it
