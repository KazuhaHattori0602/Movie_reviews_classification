this movie certainly is a weird one to say the least  the basic plot is   old business associates invite   strangers into their home for returning a lost wallet with   bucks in it  the two whom show up fall in love  the   older business men die and come back as ghosts to try to help the two younger guests out  okay so that may make sense but then we have   old guys whom apparently have some bread living together slightly weird here harry carey plays his part way off base you can t tell if he is a nice guy or really a prick  i mean really  make up my mind i can handle it  then there is richard carlson playing james houston from texas hmmmmm  he sounds way more like a southern gentleman from kentucky than a person from texas  this one isn t even close  then we take the   ghosts whom would stand a better chance of helping the new orleans saints win a play off game than actually helping out in fact they are really no help at all and why they are even in the film is beyond any scope of knowledge  silly film in which a cast of characters act totally out of character you can avoid this one
