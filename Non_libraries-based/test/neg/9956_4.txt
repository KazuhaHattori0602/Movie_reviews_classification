first of all  i have to say that i am not generally a big fan of werewolf movies in general  it s not that i don t like them  just that i don t like them a lot  there are some that i have enjoyed werewolf of london   stuart walker  an american werewolf in london   john landis and some that i have thought were okay but nothing special the wolf man   george waggner  the howling   joe dante  dog soldiers   neil marshall  are some examples but overall  the werewolf sub genre is not my favorite  but i had this one on one of those   movie sets so i thought i d give it a watch and see how it was   spoilers follow   the mad monster is a werewolf tale  but the werewolf is primarily used as a vehicle for revenge by a mad scientist  dr  lorenzo cameron  george zucco  dr  cameron has discovered a way to transform human beings into beasts  specifically wolves  but was ridiculed and ostracized by the greater scientific community  forced out of a prestigious position  he goes mad and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion  where he lives with his daughter lenora  the lovely anne nagel  and his assistant petro  glenn strange  of limited mental abilities  using his serum  dr  cameron transforms petro into a werewolf and sends him off to kill his old rivals  eventually  though  the werewolf petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creation are killed   the movie also plays out somewhat as a murder crime drama  with lenora s journalist suitor  johnny downs  investigating the doctor s strange behavior and the rash of murders  the story seems to borrow many elements from other big pictures that came before it  there are reminders of frankenstein   james whale  in the creation of a monster which runs amok  and the creature killing an innocent child  visions of dr  jekyll and mr  hyde   rouben mamoulian or the   victor fleming version  and the wolf man   george waggner  also come to mind  and that is one of the problems with this movie in my view it comes across as a mediocre melding of some great films  it doesn t add much to the genre   true  there are some redeeming qualities  george zucco s performance was convincing  and the scene showing dr  lorenzo talking to his visions hallucinations of his tormentors works well for me in showing his insanity  there is some reasonable character build up  at least in the case of his character  but glenn strange s character is not at all convincing  and seems to have this comedic quality whether intentional or not  i m not sure that just doesn t fit into the movie as a whole   i seemed to like it more than most imdb users based on my rating of   but it was still a below average film  perhaps worth a view if you are a fan of early werewolf movies or a big fan of the  s and  s horror films  but unlikely to appeal to you if you are not
