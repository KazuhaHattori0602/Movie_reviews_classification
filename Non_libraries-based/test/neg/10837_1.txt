possibly the worst movie i have ever seen  pathetic in almost every way   i threw the dvd straight in the bin   i didn t even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop   the effects are beyond a joke  the dam control room looks like cardboard  the water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds   nothing works   then there is the limp plot   about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon   i couldn t wait for them all to drown
