i checked this out for free at the library  and i still feel ripped off  yes  sandra bullock is actually in it  but only in five scenes totaling up to barely   minutes  and even those are fairly painful to watch  the rest of the movie is so bad that you ll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon  but only if you re one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it  everyone else will just turn it off  don t worry  you aren t going to miss anything  bullock s lines  assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case  are essentially just parroting of other characters lines  like this dialog   lisa  bullock     danny  please tell me what is going on   danny    i don t know    lisa    whaddaya mean you don t know    danny    i don t know   it s something to do with my dad    lisa    whaddaya mean your dad    danny    i don t know   he  ed up or something    lisa    why am i here    danny    i m sorry lisa  i don t know     moments later  danny    some army buddies of my dad           lisa    whaddaya mean army buddies   see what i mean    bottom line   just say no
