this is one of the best looking films of the past few years  the fact that it was done on a virtual shoestring   million or so they say on the dvd they infer that they ended up with even less financing  makes it all the more impressive  not simply the photography  but the design and particularly the locations  eastern montana  which are at once authentically american and otherworldly   too bad there isn t a coherent movie to go with it  an extremely promising setup of the last   hours of clearing out a rural town in   before it will be flooded for a dam is washed away with pretentious mumbo jumbo alluding to angels and a dying child  and what is presented as the  real world  is hopelessly arch  note to the polish brothers the coen brothers are funny you are not   no doubt many cineastes will find  northfork s abundant symbolism and inscrutability as marks of some sort of profundity  the sort that sophisticated types wrestle the night away with in coffeehouses while the braindead masses watch  charlie s angels  or something   sigh  if you insist   in the meantime  recommended only as a case study for filmmakers for its  impeccable technical credits and photographic beauty
