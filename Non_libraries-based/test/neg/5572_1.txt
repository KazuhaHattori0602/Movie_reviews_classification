rented free rental thank goodness  this as supposedly filmed in ct where i live could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matter  dark ninety percent of time  and just an awful attempt at a low budget flick  which can be good if done right  in a nutshell about a bunch of young adults who witness meteor fall  and subsequently fall prey to aliens on a lighthouse island  assisted by keeper and wife  analysis     acting   dreadful    writing   uninspired    story   done a million times before with different settings    production values   okay  lighting  for budget    effects  creature  digital  other  horrible very cheap looking  so  you get the gist of it  to add insult to injury  end credits has bloopers of filming   really now who cares  distributed under a universal company  shocked they would even do so after viewing   finally as alternative  try  creep  low budget  but well written  well acted  and fairly  well  creepy
