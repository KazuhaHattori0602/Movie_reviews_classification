it is so bad  i can not tear myself away  i keep asking myself   why   why  with every scene   there is no continuity  but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things big  big boats  big boys  big planes  then you don t have to worry about things like plot or character  i am baffled  and very concerned that the cag looks so much like richard pryor  it seems wrong to put a pryor look alike in such a terrible movie  but i can t tear myself away  this movie is the first movie i ve ever reviewed  that is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is  it motivated me to join this site  i have counted   main characters  perhaps if i was stoned i could follow this  but as it is  i feel like i m in some kind of never ending bad dream  where it is always   and we were the greatest cocktry on earth
