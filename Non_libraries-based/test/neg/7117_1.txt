not well done at all  the whole movie was just the grudge going around and killing random people out of nowhere  random people that have nothing to do with the story get killed  like the   school girls for example   the family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story either  i believe them to be a random family that never went in the house  and never had anything to do with the killings of the grudge   did not impress me at all  i was not scared  i didn t jump at any parts  and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money off of  makes the gridge   look like crap also  which was actually an alright movie   i believe that the grudge   is like a leading movie to the grudge   if they ever make one  they shouldn t have even called this the grudge   they should of called it the prologue to the grudge   and you will see if you watched it  because i am not going to spoil anything  not that it would have mattered anyway     not scary  bad story  and is just completely random
