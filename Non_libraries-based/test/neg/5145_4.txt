this well meant film falls just a bit short  and unfortunately in too many areas   the scenery is gorgeous  with vistas of north central vermont providing the setting for this mid century tale  quebec bill endeavors to go back to his whiskey running past in order to save his farm   going back and forth between scenes of magical realism and straight forward action  this film rarely hits its stride   kris kristofferson as quebec bill seems pretty stilted  or else it s his lines  or else his cross of yankee and quebecois accents  anyway  he just comes off as a low key blow hard  his dialogs with gary farmer s coville character do sparkle  though  william sanderson s rat kinneson is solid  charlie mcdermott shows some real potential as young wild bill  but his part s not large enough to carry a scene and he never steals one  luis guzman shows up on lake memphramagog  with a fine stand in performance by lake willoughby  as a monk with a boys n the hood accent  who knows  and then there s bujold s cordelia  an oracle like her namesake  she channels yoda as she intones lines like  you will marry a quebec woman  just too weird and nowhere near enigmatic enough   the end gets really choppy  again a bad mix of magical realism and the concrete  and yoda never provides an answer we can understand
