i m sorry  but this really does feel like a modern day apollo   knock off  totally implausible  at least armageddon felt like a comic book  this felt like a bad high school film project  acting was about as clich  as one can get  and landing a space shuttle on an la freeway  come on  seriously  jerry  what were you thinking  and all the clich s  the pregnant astronaut s wife  the nosy reporter who gets in everyone s way  the stalwart manager with  go fever  and it s one thing to twist the laws of physics or politics or whatever to make an entertaining story  but at least make it good  fact and science were totally butchered for this  the space shuttle doesn t have fuel tanks in it s wings  and even if it did  it couldn t steer by shifting fuel between them  and neither could a dc   if you like bad acting  bad storytelling  low realism  and cheesy clich s  this one can t be beat
