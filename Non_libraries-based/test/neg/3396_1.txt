this is my opinion of this movie  expressed in its dialogs   to be more serious  i can t say this movie is a bad moment but i didn t enjoy it either    first  i was simply indifferent   couldn t get my mind into the apes world  even though the make up are very realistic  the constant screaming was irritating  may the film have changed apes for cats and it s a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter   the second part is more interesting  with the talent and freshness of then newcomers  macdowell   lambert  but i felt alienated  all the story is located in a big british mansion  no matter how luxurious is it  it was like a prison for me   at last  it could be a good adaptation of the burroughs  story of tarzan   i don t know  having never read the book  or seen the disney     in conclusion  i don t have any good moments to remember  so one viewing would be enough for me    i should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called  overture  at the beginning  what s the meaning  only the director knows it
