as ben elton once observed  nothing goes quicker out of style than comedy  steve martin s latest offering    the pink panther     recently opened to bad reviews and dismal box office grosses  while mike myers   the love guru  seems to have won few admirers   in   it was jerry lewis  turn to feel the pain of rejection   ironically  his character in this film experiences a funny turn whenever anyone uses that word in his presence   when  which way to the front  effectively drove him off the big screen for almost a decade   in this world war two comedy  he plays  brendan byers   the richest man in the world  who wants to join the army to do his patriotic duty   and also because he is bored with being successful   but is rejected as he is medically unfit  he then decides to start his own privately funded army  recruiting other  f s   decked out with ludicrous uniforms that look like those worn by  international rescue  in  thunderbirds  they go into training  some good visual gags here  when they fire rocket launchers  they look pleased with themselves  until they learn they have just destroyed a texaco oil station  wishing to learn german  brendan plays a long playing record called  songs to mein kampf by  when this army sits down to eat  instead of being in a draughty mess hall  they are in an opulent room decked out with a chandelier   john wood is very funny as  finkel  byers  ever so english butler  his best scene is when he blackmails a mafia type gangster into teaching byers  brigade to kill   the script was not by jerry himself  but by gerald gardiner and dee caruso  author of a number of episodes of  the monkees   front  often has the look and feel of a television sitcom  indeed at times you almost expect to hear a laugh track   where it goes badly wrong is in the last thirty minutes when byers replaces a top nazi commander and  after ordering the germans to withdraw from the front  gets involved in the plot to kill hitler   and tom cruise is nowhere in sight    as the commander  jerry delivers a performance of such mind numbing ineptitude as to defy description  he gives brian blessed a run for his money in the  loudest man alive  stakes  it comes as a relief when the end credits appear   perhaps the timing was just wrong   bringing out a war comedy when the vietnam conflict was raging was not a good idea  or the public simply had had enough of jerry   that beard probably did not help    what he needed here was a good producer  someone to take him in hand and say   that gag stinks  throw it out   don t raise the bridge  lower the river  is a masterpiece by comparison with this picture   as the  s got underway  the new comedy icons would be woody allen  mel brooks  and monty python   fresher  more biting and in allen s case  more human styles of comedy replaced jerry s brand of slapstick  it would not be until   that he would make anything like a successful comeback   as the conceited talk show host  jerry langford  in martin scorcese s brilliant  the king of comedy
