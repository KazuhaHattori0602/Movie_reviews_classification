i think i watched a highly edited version because it wasn t nearly as graphic as i expected   based on the other reviews that i have heard   other than   being written by the same person who wrote the original  emmanuelle    emmanuelle arsan    the lead character being a sexually free spirit  and   being set in the exotic locale of asia   laure  doesn t have the same flair as its predecessor   i just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that i m really not that interested in  i e  the voyeuristic  open relationship between laure and nick   i m just happy with whatever brings her pleasure something along those lines  i cannot relate to this mentality and the film characters don t really shed any light   the second half about finding the mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film  one that i didn t care for  by that time  i was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest   maybe i just didn t get it   i ll leave it at that
