i bought this movie from a market stall three years ago  i gotta hand it to you when i sat down and watched it  i thought  ok  this is gonna be another big action b movie  obviously i was wrong  while watching this film  i began to realise that this movie was taking me to another planet  full of cr p   i began to get really bored and fed up with this film  although i wanted to see was gonna happen in the end  i really felt like it was really getting on my nerves   the people behind the film may ve brought some well known name actors into this project  but what were they thinking  even these actors couldn t save this film   at the end of the film  i felt like this was a waste of money  just buying this low life sucker of film for a small amount of money  a few months later  i sent the tape off to charity  i didn t want to see it again   sorry  but if you re thinking of watching a movie and then nodding off to sleep  i can highly recommend it you  me  i ll rather go on pro plus and watch something decent   disappointing   out of
