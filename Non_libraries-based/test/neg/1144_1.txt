i sat through all   hours  i do not know what was worse  the awful plot  the lame characters or the hawaiian hottie that eddie s   yearold kid and   year old grandpa made sexual advances toward  the money spent on this was just flushed down the throne  matty simmons should be ashamed  the original idea for this movie was  a swiss family griswold  and it somehow turned into this mess  the only bright spot is that it s ratings were so bad we will never see this on tv again  avoid at all costs rent ernest saves xmas or something else
