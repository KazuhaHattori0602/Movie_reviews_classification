when i first saw this i thought it was a joke  all i could think was  you get the  mm camera  i ll get my little brother s monster toys  we ll make a movie  why would anyone in a modern time like   make a sci fi movie like this  it looks like it was made in the early  s  with actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian  a script that was written by the director s  year old son  a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop  poverty row special effects  and to top it off  a director that thought making this crap would make them famous  the end result wasn t spectacular  complete with scrappy dialogue and continuity  from venus must have been fun to make and i m sure everyone involved had a blast with their silly little movie   a   out of   for a valiant  hopeless effort
