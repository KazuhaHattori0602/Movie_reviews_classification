half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera  the rest is made up of predictable characters  think science vs  government   know how  vs  authority  etc    what is the worst aspect about this movie  is it the cars being thrown around in the first   minutes  is the horrible  russian  accent of the  cosmonaut  is it the uninspired characters  the poorly integrated top   hits  or the  us will save the world  vitriol  no  it s the fact that regardless of the  sad  ending   there is very little suspense in this movie   we basically know what s going to happen   the one good part of this movie   american components  russian components  all made in taiwan
