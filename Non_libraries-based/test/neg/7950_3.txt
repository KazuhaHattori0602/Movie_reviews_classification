i found this movie at a xxx store for   on vhs  the interesting thing about it is that camp video bought up the rights to it and slapped on a   copywrite date in the credits  anyways  enough of odd facts   this film is absolutely not scary  to even call this horror or a  thriller  is laughable  there were only maybe   minutes at most of what you would call horror in this   minute film  and that consisted of the acting  because it was horrorible  all puns aside  the writing for this film was absolute garbage as well  just as the special effects and makeup was laughable  no wonder this is such an obscure film  probably the director has spent the last   years scouring the country for all existing copies of it and burning them in one big pile so no one else could be subjected to it
