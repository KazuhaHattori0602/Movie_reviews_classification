yash raj films are so funny  whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house   seeing bhatt films working they copied the formula  bikini and everything plus casting low actors like uday and tanishaa  the film is so horrible it makes you cringe  the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them uday resembles a gay plus a monkey  tanishaa resembles an idiot   the director thinks we all are idiots arjun sablok takes the audience for granted music is saving grace camera work is good  uday chopra hams like an idiot  tanishaa looks like kajol in k g if kajol was annoying der then tanishaa is worse the rest are okay
