i love movies  all genres  and from big dollar spectacles to small indie projects  but even making allowance for this piece of junk being   years old and its attempt at homage to the  s it just suffers in almost aspect  by which we judge films   throughout the movie  i was reminded of several  student films  i ve had a chance to watch  efforts where creativity is required to fill gaps where funds are needed    all in all  chances are there are much better uses for   minutes of your life
