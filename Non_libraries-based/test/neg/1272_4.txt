and again  i find myself in the minority   i didn t like this one  this is the only varney work i haven t embraced  including knowhutimean  slam dunk ernest rates the credit for being the worst of the line  but this is a clear competitor for that dubious title   this work is too rough  and too base to be lovable  lovability was one of ernest s key components  and this element was completely lost herein  unfortunately  most think this is the best of the line  but if you loved the essence of what made ernest  ernest  you will realize to what i refer about fifteen minutes into this work  it was too blatantly base to be fun   it rates a   from   the fiend
