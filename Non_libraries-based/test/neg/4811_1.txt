ni as mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera    the acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas  i guess the writer and director has seen too many mexican soap operas and can t conceive anything remotely different    give it up  go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please    stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable mexican film industry    it is not an ok or good movie  it s a mediocre soap opera
