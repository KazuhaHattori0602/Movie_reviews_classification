first of all  since i m one of the people who never saw the mst k chopped up version of this movie  i can t comment on that   however  i did see the original version of this movie on the sci fi channel and i thought it was just as good as anything else on that channel  in fact  i thought it was one of their better offerings   i ve noticed in perusing the comments here that the people who write in detail about soultaker with a modicum of intelligence  thoughtfulness and maturity tend to like at least a few things about this movie and rightly so  in it s original cut  most reasonable people i think would probably rate it at least   or   stars out of   five is average to me and i think this movie is about average for a sci fi pic   in contrast to the above  i ve also noticed that the reviewers who seem immature  dull and flip and as a result come off as boneheads from where i stand  are the same ones who can t find anything good about this movie and basically trash it without cause based mostly on seeing it chopped up and fricasseed on mst k  or if they have seen both cuts it seems they were greatly prejudiced by the mst k viewing to begin with
