this is the first film i ve watched from the italian ed wood  demofilo fidani aka miles deem  the above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled   movie starring richard basehart which was hammer films  michael carreras  one and only stab at the western  the genuine italian title was originally translated as his name was sam walbash  but they called him amen
although it was actually wallach in the italian variant which  of course  implies a tribute of sorts to hollywood actor eli    while certainly not unwatchably bad  instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that i was often cracking up into howls of laughter  a horrid number by a would be irresistible french chanteuse  a totally irrelevant bar room brawl  actors doing somersaults when being shot  an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine  ineffective use  indeed abuse  of slow motion  and  easily the most preposterous  seeing gordon mitchell and lincoln tate play two gunfighters  sporting the actors  own names  hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all    lead actor robert woods is just that even down to ineffectively whispering the amens over the bodies of his victims  supporting actress simonella vitelli  actually  the director s own daughter  as the villain s broad is quite a looker but  unfortunately  she doesn t get to do much in the film   despite having a change of heart towards the end  the main musical theme is actually pretty good but  again  the title song is  in itself  quite lousy
