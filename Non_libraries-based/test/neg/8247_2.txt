i sat down through   hours of pure boredom  i look here on imdb  even though it is not high on the list  it is in the top   i was a little surpised  even though  yes  i am very impressed with robin and matt s acting abilities  they still didn t save the movie  i m not sure what i really didn t like about the movie  maybe it s because i dispise math  maybe i m not too much for dreary talking for   hours  even though i loved  american beauty  but that was it  i just want my   hours back  it was a big waste of my time  if i m missing something in this movie  please e mail me  i am curious why this is on the top   and don t say  because it was a good movie
