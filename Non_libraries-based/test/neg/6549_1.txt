the only positive thing i can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now i finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie i ever saw was called   it would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even    why would anyone want to produce such waste    i refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented    making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point    anything else just doesn t make sense
