foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous  disfigured gypsy    the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film  that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination  the victim characters are all too familiar idiot teens which means one doesn t really care about them  we just wonder when they will die  not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless  unnecessary nature footage  however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans  the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere  and a decent music score by don peake  still  it s business as usual for dead camper movies   there are much better films in this vein  but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die hard slasher fans  although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn   wrong turn   or even the final terror   again       out of
