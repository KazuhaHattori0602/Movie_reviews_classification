i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all   in this case however i have to say it was bad  i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second   there was no proper storyline  i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces   the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these   pieces is scary  half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third  a   year old kid would have been able to put them together   this movie was bad   dominic
