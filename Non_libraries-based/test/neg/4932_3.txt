i hate guns and have never murdered anyone  but when even half of the events that take place in  shuttle  happen to you or close ones and you find a gun  you shoot your attacker  three times  five times  whatever makes the pulse stop on them and increase on you  i think even god would say   good call  in a very  hostel type film  but more realistic   as this really could happen to anyone  well  if you re a pretty young woman  that is    shuttle  was a decent film  though on the long side  a few good shocks  always call aaa even just to change a tire  basically just one surprise but for the most part  you could see things coming  and aside from the typical  tie him up  instead of the previously mentioned shooting him  the most annoying part was the revelation towards the closing from one best friend to the other  getting past those  it s enjoyable for what it is  basically  we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from mexico home  wow  that s original  and one lost her luggage preventing them from leaving the airport until late  and after an obvious foreshadowed sign language scene  they enter a  too good to be true  half price shuttle ride  clich d jocks  previously introduced  con their way on the shuttle  to join what appears to be alan ruck s stunt double from  speed  from here  it s obvious what happens  i did mention it was a  hostel  knock off  but still  i didn t find too much horrible  yet nothing spectacular  though  it would ve served the audience better with roughly   minutes deleted  i would recommend if you have almost   hours to kill and are into sick horror
