not a terrible film   my   year old boy loved it  and he would be the target demographic  so i guess they hit the spot  pretty dull for an adult though   hard to relate to animated lego characters  even mod high tech ones   i thought the choice of the three great virtues of the bionicle world was a bit odd   unity  duty  and destiny  am i the only one who thinks those sound just a bit fascistic  especially destiny  what about freedom  equality  justice  etc   oh well  it will sell lego  kind of dull for a movie  but not bad for a  minute advertisement  could have been a lot worse
