just finished watching  ftm  the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend  something i never do  needless to say i was very disappointed  the story has so much potential and it s frustrating to see it get screwed up  i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey  first off i am not a mm hater  i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star  i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off   times  yes we all get it that he a good looking guy with a nice body  but i think most people knew this   years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill  showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman   times in the movie is totally unnecessary  i think one time would have been sufficient  it wouldn t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other  no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling  unless enough about that  let s get into his role  i feel his acting was very forced and he didn t seem very comfortable  i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner  but his lines were corny and cheesy  it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times  in short  i didn t like his character even though i was supposed to  the accent  his shirt off  corny pick up lines  weak sales pitches  his character was just too much of a tool  as brandon or jonathan  pacino and assante were great  but that  no surprise  piven is fun to watch as arie oooops i mean jerry  i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly  it s insulting that they could take a great story  and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success    cool story that appeals to the male man   hunky hollywood actor for female women  make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights    al pacino with   great speech scenes  and   great one liners   every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan   jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school   throw in armand assante to seal the deal   plot  good writing  character development  and intelligent casting are unnecessary  this will be good enough for most people  but not me  anybody who disagrees with me  ask your self this  would this movie be much better if  a  directed by sodeberg b  decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm  i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks  i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo  the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing  the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants  big budget crapola
