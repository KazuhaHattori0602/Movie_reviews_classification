jack o   was a really bad movie  we are talking snoozefest x   no entertainment value whatsoever  no budget  no gore  z grade actors etc etc  this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn t have been made  the only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew linnea quigley was in it  and sure enough  she does her obligatory nude shower scene  which is lovely yes   but as for the film itself  i fell asleep at the   minute stage and had no desire at all to finish it  it s just bigtime lame ok   i love horror movies  i m an avid fan  a massive fan  i love low budget horrors  i love it all  but i hated this rubbish  so i think that will tell you all you need to know about  jack o   i give this movie   the   is for the   minute linnea shower scene  the movie itself is a total zero
