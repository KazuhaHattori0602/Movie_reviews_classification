i decided to watch this movie because i d not seen carol lombard before in any movie  i m sorry it had to be this one because  quite frankly  this is a dog   and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn  both of whom were great actors   the problem with the film is simple  it tries to put too much  too quickly  in to a story about a young lawyer  john manson played by stewart  who marries jane  played by lombard  within an hour of meeting her  what s that clich  marry in haste  repent at leisure    in short  the story is a series of episodes that show the couples  worsening financial status  their troubles with john s live in mother  their struggles to pay the bills  john s diminished status at the office  the arrival of their baby son  john jnr  unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother  the couples  angst about their marriage  the baby s sickness which worsens  thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot  in a fierce storm  to bring a special serum to save the child  and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm   how many more clich d situations could the writers include  maybe mother dying soon after  there wasn t much comedy  the drama was lacklustre  at best  the dialog was painful to hear  only the acting of the four main players was adequate   this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn   during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie   so  it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol  home spun american values of family  relationships  heroism  perseverance  and initiative   all against the backdrop of the  average  american family  who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard    and  it should be noted that the film was released in early   so  it was planned in     soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii  hence  this sort of film was a great booster for the general public  at that time  many of who would soon have to join england in war  as many here would know  hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before  during and after the war   however  i m glad i saw it   as a piece of disguised socio political propaganda  but  i ll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range   as another reviewer noted  see this one just to say that you ve seen all of stewart s movies  otherwise  don t bother
