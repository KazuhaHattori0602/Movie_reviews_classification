b  kennedy tried to make a sequel by exaggerating and amplifying a gargantuan leftist western  not as leftist as the g  kennedy sequel  that came after this one   this is the ugliest film of the two sequels very ugly looking  it is slapdash  b  kennedy made it amplifying but without having the genius for that  hundreds of peons  hundreds of mexican _compadres  hundreds of women  a desert  barren landscapes  a storm the largest scale   everything in this clumsy sequel  likable only in a weird way  is phony   the movie itself is very ugly looking  brynner  who made the best part in the first film  doesn t look good at all in this one   rey plays a priest  he will be a political leader  quintero  in the next sequel of the franchise    it is true that when you have that many characters you may not need a very interesting storyline  sometimes  e g  brynner meets mcqueen  then they pick other  compadres  or  b  spencer meets coburn  etc  it s fun to see where and how they ll meet the rest of the crew  etc  but you need at least these several characters  unfortunately  burt kennedy s installment is not very good at that    return of the seven   begins with a bullfighting  vin and chris meet there  they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original magnificents chico  who belongs to a huge group of   peons abducted by the mexican bandits  we find out the name of chico s appealing wife it s petra  chris must constitute again a small army and here we have a dirty dozen treat chris chooses his men from the convicts  another member of the commando is a womanizer  who will take good care of the wives left without husbands  the sexual humor is especially displeasing and distasteful in this film  it strives to seem smart and spicy  it is simply boorish and dumb and gross   the choosing of the members of the small army was one of the greatest joys in the mcqueen film  unfortunately  in the first sequel there is the most unmemorable of the three crews assembled under the magnificent seven s name   robert fuller makes a lousy  vin oates is the smiley womanizer   in this mock gargantuan attempt  a mexican revolutionary leader has a gargantuan plan he kidnaps   peons and uses them to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons   useless to say that this insane mexican revolutionist doesn t equal wallach s part in the first film  b  kennedy bets exclusively on camp and over the top stuff  ugly landscapes  a thunderstorm  gargantuan lightning  a desert  a huge battle between the emancipated peons and the revolutionary vaqueros  of course return of the seven   completely abandoned the good sense of the mcqueen film   what is particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original film yet  everything changed meantime in the way of making westerns   both the sequels look weird
