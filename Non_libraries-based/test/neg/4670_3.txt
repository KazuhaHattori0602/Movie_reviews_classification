i remember thinking that due to the cast  the subject matter  and the director  i was going to love this movie   stepping into the theatre and taking my seat  i was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built   i was not disappointed with the opening and felt that i was truly going to love this movie   if you haven t seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler  please stop reading  i m not going to give away anything really important  but it might be seen as such  so that is the warning   spoiler may be included below  beware   i think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the russian space station scene  i mean honestly  refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning  and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode   while all of this is possible  it seemed to me to be way over the top  i m not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting  the silly view of the russian technology  or just the campy attitude of the scene itself   it only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like   hours of constant super loud explosions in space you know  that place where there is no sound because it s a vacuum   but the coup de grace for me  honestly  was the gun scene   spoiler possibility    earlier in the movie  we see bruce willis tearing apart their land vehicle  the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill  when he is told that this is what they will be using  he is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what s on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing   so then  as we are wandering onto the asteroids  we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles you know  standard nasa fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case  you know  aliens or something   i could have taken the explosive   hours  the silly russian space station refueling scene  the cheesy love scene near the end  the bruce willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters  but the steve buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle s gun all over the place and causing havoc damage  well that threw the entire thing over the top for me   save your money and time and avoid this movie  if you want a good meteor movie  see deep impact  if you want a fun space movie with awesome special effects  see space cowboys  but no matter what  avoid this flick
