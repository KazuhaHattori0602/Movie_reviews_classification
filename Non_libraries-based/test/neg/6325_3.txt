if you read the plot summary for  mad max  you ve just ruined the first   hour and   minutes of the film  you ve also found out that  mad max  takes place in post apocalyptic australia  which will be helpful because otherwise you won t have any idea what s going on  the film  made in   tries really hard to be stanley kubrick s  a clockwork orange    only that film  in all its strangeness  actually makes sense and leaves an impact  this film does neither and ends up being a car bike stunt filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does   the first thing wrong with  mad max  is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final   minutes  if the first hour were condensed to   minutes and then the final   added on and then another hour added after that   mad max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist  instead  mel gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for   of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge  i ve yet to watch the sequel  road warrior  and i have to admit i m excited for it only because i want to know what he does next  this first film was mostly a waste of time   george miller does some great action stuff here  but his over the top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments  its a terribly clich  b movie technique   there is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think  a great action sci fi movie at least makes a point  but the gratuitous violence done by random  weird bikers doesn t say anything of value  even the villain toecutter feels modeled off alex of  clockwork  only uglier and completely unimposing  the pg violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer  it just cheeses it up if anything   i ll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions  everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity  you get something good and the film ends   minutes later  i m just crossing my fingers  road warrior  will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends  otherwise that s more time wasted   steven c  visit my site at
