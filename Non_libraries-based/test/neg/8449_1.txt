i was duped as well  here i was expecting all sorts of man eating pirahnas and what the hell do you get   an hour and a half of nothing  but awkward silences with some weird guy  who isn t weird enough to be scary   i thought there was no way   could be too much for a movie   damn i was sooooo wrong  it was very hard to watch the whole thing   don t fool yourself  its not so good that its bad  its not even that kind of movie   its nothing  an hour and a half of absolutely nothing   piece of crap
