l humanit  is a murder mystery  these movies tend to be popular   and the   rating it currently has suggests that it has been  too   unfortunately  this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever   a few non spoilers  for instance  include a  minute scene  wherein the main character eats an apple  and another   minutes  where he breathes   in case you were wondering  this is not  in fact  art  neither is it a  commentary on humanity  which from the title it seems it is trying  to be  it is  in fact  boring  there are numerous attempts in this  movie to say something about humanity  one might think to  onesself   how would i comment on humanity  and the most  obvious and boring answers will of course be sex  love  and death   not that these options are uninteresting when done well   just that  they are the canonical options  for sex  this movie does its best to  make it unattractive and disgusting  in your first five minutes    hence this is not a spoiler   you will see the bloodied vagina of a  murdered  year old girl  it s a murder mystery  remember  later  on  a few people throw themselves at each other and have what  the director would like us to believe is  raw  sex  but in reality it s  contrived and overly symbolic   but worse yet  uninterestingly so   i enjoy being disturbed by movies  this movie showed me why   disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone   their humanity  which they did not know existed and are a bit  scared of  l humanit  tried to do just this and failed  and i walked  out of the theatre not disturbed  but disgusted  thinking that i had  wasted my time in the theater  despite having seen the movie for  free
