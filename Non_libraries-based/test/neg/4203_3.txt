i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films  and it shows  we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting  but that s not what we watch him for  although there have been a few earthquakes in california since this movie was made  there never was any desert or hills between hwy  and i   billy was supposedly crossing over from   to   along   a distance of less that   miles  i wish that the writers  producers and directors of these movies would  at least  look at a map  as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california  i could tell right from the start that the geography was wrong  however  there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half  so grab your doritos and an adult beverage and enjoy a trip back in time
