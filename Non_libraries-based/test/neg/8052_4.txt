i first watched kindred in   along with another movie called devouring waves  i remember back then i hated them both and i have never really bothered to watch them again   however i have recently started a crusade to collect as many  s horror titles in their original boxed form  that have been deleted for some time  i have got myself quite a proud collection with many more titles on my list   the kindred although i have not as yet got a copy is high priority as all the old movies i didn t like back then  i now own and have now re watched and think they are brilliant and the bits i do remember of the kindred are now driving me to want to get hold of a copy a s a p   hurray for the  s and long live horror
