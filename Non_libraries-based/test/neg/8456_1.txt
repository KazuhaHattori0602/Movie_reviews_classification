so you ve got a number of models on an island  and one by one they re picked off agatha christie style  we get somebody lost at sea  pushed off a cliff  poisoned by a solvent  driven off a cliff  blown up  etc  nothing terribly graphic   before any of that starts  one woman inexplicably has a dream of a killer in a weird human face mask   the owner of the magazine is a sleaze who had an affair  and somebody had photos taken of her before she was of age   in the end  it s all about business  or something   there s an  s style montage of a photo shoot  most of the bathing suits being one pieces  surprisingly  a couple are fairly translucent  there s camera clicks during the montage where the frame of the camera appears as a white square or rectangle within the picture  the photographer is rather bad at framing
