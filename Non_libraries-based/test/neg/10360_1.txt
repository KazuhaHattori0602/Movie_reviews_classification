yes  i admire the independent spirit of it all  but it s like road trip with a bad cast and no budget   i chuckle when i watch american comedies  i don t laugh  this movie made me laugh  but only because of the abundantly obvious attempts to simulate high budget american high school pot flicks   if you want good independent american comedy with pot references  go watch kevin smith or richard linklater flicks or something  don t waste your time on this piece of sh t movie   i mean  how can you take these comments seriously when most people are complaining about the characters not smoking pot   and by the way  in norway it s called  dude  where s my pot
