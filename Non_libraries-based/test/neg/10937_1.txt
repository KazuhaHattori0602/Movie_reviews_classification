did uwe boll seriously just rip off the basic idea and dialogue from se en  why is it so fekking difficult for this douchebag to be original  he even mentioned in an interview with gametrailers that he chooses stuff like games to make into movies because the characters  plots  backstories and so on are already there and ready for him to screw with   guess it isn t too much of a stretch for him to rip off another movie entirely   i mean  seriously  what the hell  here s something i made in uwe s  honor
