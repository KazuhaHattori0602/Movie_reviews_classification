i was so offended by this film that i had to write something about it  so please humour me   its only redeeming virtue  outside of some good acting  is that it doesn t go on past   minutes  even that length is about   minutes too long   comparisons have been made here to the brilliantly dark  the grifters  but i can t see it  they are two different films altogether  the closest  swindled  comes to an existing film is  the sting  made in   it borrows  sorry  steals  liberally from this splendid george roy hill  entertainment  which is exactly what is was  i enjoyed it because it didn t pretend to be anything else   there are so many red herrings in  swindled  that i thought i was in a fish tank  it s very confusing  but that s only one of its many problems  the principal one is this  if you make a film where everyone lies to everyone else  where everyone is conning  we have no  anchor  to ground us  the inevitable result is a mish mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper flicks   just about everyone in this film is conniving and objectionable  surely a basic film   class would tell us that the audience has to  care  for someone  we can t  care  for anyone here  they re all swines  it might have worked as a rakish comedy  but it plays it straight from beginning to end   if you want to see this film  read no further  big  spoiler  coming  sorry  but i have to do it   there s so much fake blood and so many fake killings that it doesn t strain credulity   it destroys it  the ending is absolutely ridiculous   a  murder  in a crowded airport that isn t really a  murder  at all  and the  murdered  guy  blood soaked  simply stands up  brushes himself off  and walks away  fake blood dripping  with the booty  all while the police and hordes of people are looking on  and no one intercedes  the director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we re supposed to buy into this  noirish b movies from the  s did better    i m a great fan of european flicks  but this confirms that schlock doesn t always come from hollywood  as far as  swindled  is concerned  my judgment lies with a famous line from the oft misspoken producer samuel goldwyn  who knew all about schlock   include me out
