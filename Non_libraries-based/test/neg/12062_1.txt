idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots  yes camp blood  or if you re wanting an awful  badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film   camp bloody awful  is so bad it s actually quite depressing to watch  and it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film    awful acting check  bad script check  tacky effects check no originality whatsoever double check    it doesn t even attempt to be different  and is riddled with every predicted clich  imaginable  for example  the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods  so of course they end up dead    one of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels  how and why only baffles the mind    just stay away from this one
