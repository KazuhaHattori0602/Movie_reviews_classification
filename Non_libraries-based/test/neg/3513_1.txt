dumb  meaningless movie should appeal to southern rednecks  teenagers with iq s bordering on retarded and the average bush supporter  noble willingham plays the lead in this simpleminded script for what it is and uses a generous dose of mfers  eff this and eff that and sobs  the ending which i anticipated to  save  this hollow story was the biggest letdown  leaving me hanging and wondering   why   it s a story of cat   mouse or more like bully vs  victim   don t waste your time unless you like hearing the phone ringing every   minutes and constant cursing and screaming throughout this   minute piece of dumpster droppings
