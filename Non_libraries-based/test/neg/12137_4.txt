boring as hell and kind of a chick flick   it s the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement  the romantic nature of a one night stand  and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love   many of the story s motifs are reminiscent of other recent kst movies  e g  the english patient  but have far less appeal   after the first half hour i started checking my watch  wondering if i d make it home in time to catch leno on tv   i passed up  gladiator  to see this
