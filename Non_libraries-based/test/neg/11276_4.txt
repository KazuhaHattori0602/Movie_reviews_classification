when watching this movie  with it s deterministic cause and effect  wall to wall clich s and hackneyed sentiment  can anyone be so naive as to think that this is actually how barrie s life played out  you watch it in a posture of disagreement  hollywood biopics aren t based on the individual lives anymore  they re just rewrites of previously successful biopics  if hollywood made a movie about your life it would be filled with such perfect synchronization that you d barely recognize your own story  any personal complexity would be obliterated by some all explaining  simplistic backstory  your story would resemble  rocky  because it s the only life arc hollywood knows how to produce anymore  we couldn t leave the audience pondering anything left open ended as they exit  this movie doesn t trust an audience to figure things out without being led to them  i perceived the captain hook mother reference eons before the movie literalized it for me  i could see the   kids twist coming for days   this is a completely average movie  not horrible but not great  hence it s likely to be showered with a few oscars next year  there s nothing the academy likes better than congratulating itself for finally noticing patterns put in place over the previous thirty years   from the new yorker article  lost boys  by anthony lane     arthur llewelyn davies  also adored his boys  and it may be unfair of  finding neverland  to omit him  for streamlining purposes  from the scene  by the time that johnny depp meets kate winslet  she is already a widow  whereas arthur was very much alive when barrie first entered the consciousness and  little by little  the home of the llewellyn davies family    finding neverland  is a weepie  from the moment that barrie met george and jack  and started to ponder the means by which they might be rendered immortal  the story is sad  but the reality is even more dismal   arthur llewellyn davies dies from cancer of the jaw   sylvia dies of lung cancer  the five boys are orphaned  barrie is made their guardian   george is killed in the first world war  fighting with his regiment in flanders   michael  an undergraduate at oxford  is drowned while swimming with a friend  the two bodies  when recovered  are found clinging together   on april     peter llewellyn davies  by then an esteemed publisher  threw himself under a subway train in london  we should not presume to read a mind in torment  but we may note in passing that  if he had lived another month  he would have reached the centenary of barrie s birth and thus  one imagines  a fresh flurry of interest in  peter pan that terrible masterpiece  in the words of peter llewellyn davies
