i literally ran to watch it  expecting a film that will make me cry  or touch my heart   what i found was not heart rending  but a lame exploitation of   strong human character   interwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man   in a setting that is substantially devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common   it was not entirely bad  as i have seen worst   and i left the cinema   poorer but wiser   that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well made
