i couldn t help but laugh when i saw what the public could be made to think was email back in   apparently email is an interactive discussion  similar to a chat  with lame voice synthesis reading every comment out loud  and some of the other  tech  aspects are also laugh out loud funny  i d swear the  high tech  communications centre she has actually has a few commodore   monitors in it  almost like watching the movie hackers nowadays  i guess   despite the fact that for most of the movie the lead actress carries off the illusion of being disabled  the final part of the movie has an unexplained use of her legs which somehow i can t ignore  i mean  why include something so stupid    anyway  to sum up  the plot is pretty predictable  the acting bad  the killer quite guessable  but it can be amusing in a mystery science theatre   kind of way i guess
