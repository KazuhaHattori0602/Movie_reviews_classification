i rented this when it came out on video cassette in   after rewatching it again my idea about it hasn t changed much   i was an adult then and i m still an adult now lol  the illogical elements mentioned by other reviewers didn t bother me  this isn t a documentary it s a fantasy story where animals can talk   while i didn t care for much of the songs i liked the one at the end of the picture where it s sang by barry manilow and another person   some people seem to make an excuse for it s primitive animation by saying that cgi wasn t used often in animated features but let s not forget that the lion king was released about a year earlier and that packed possibly more excellence than any animated feature that came before it   but i think it s pretty fair to say that the pebble and the pingoin was made on the cheap while the lion king wasn t   the high points for me in   as well as today is the suspense generated by the few dangerous mostly  underwater chase scenes   i also liked the opening scene which takes place on a music notes page and a little bit of the love story  but most of the time the story dragged on and was boring   worth a look if you like animation but if you re an adult and not a risk taker go get another walt disney production instead of this
