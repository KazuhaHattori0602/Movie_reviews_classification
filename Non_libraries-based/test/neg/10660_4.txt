i do not like himesh reshamiya  i do not like his singing too  but his songs are a craze in india  especially among commoners  now when he ventured to become an actor   that was a big joke  what guts he has to reap as much as he can in his prime time  i did never want to see this movie  but one thing changed it  the movie becoming a super duper hit  after   weeks  aap ka saroor has raked box office collection of   crores   compared to apne that has collected   crores in the same   weeks  if i can sit through apne and rajnikant s absurd sivaji   i should give this movie also a try to understand what stuff this movie has got that made it such a big hit  the story is about the real life singer himesh reshamiya  hr  who has gone to germany for a concert and falls in love with riya  hansika motwani  a german lawyer ruby  mallika sherawat  loves himesh  now himesh is arrested for a murder  the mission of himesh  in last   minutes  after he runs away from jail is to prove himself innocent and find the real murderer   let me say that himesh has nothing in him to become a hero  he tries hard but fails miserably  he is pathetic  i was thinking what could have made the movie click so much  let me find something positive   first  the saving grace of the movie is the script till the point himesh runs away from the jail   but after that the movie nose dives into unbearable stupid limits  second  the songs of the movie are good  catchy  crowd puller numbers  third  mallika sherawat   she looks gorgeous and acts well too  as the second lady  i can imagine fans of mallika coming to see the movie just for her  fourth  the cinematography of the movie is pleasing   especially the german locales  are a treat to watch for the eye  fifth  the major portion of the story is a love story between himesh and riya   with clich d dialogues that would probably connect to young crowd  sixth  the director prashant chadha has done a decent job in covering the pathetic acting skills of himesh as much as possible with shots that don t need himesh to act much   the heroine hansika motwani looks like a small budget film heroine  raj babbar is wasted in a small role  overall the movie is a below average   i was thinking throughout the movie   what if the same movie script was done with salmaan as the main lead  i think it would have had been a much better affair  may be then i would have given the movie   out of   but now
