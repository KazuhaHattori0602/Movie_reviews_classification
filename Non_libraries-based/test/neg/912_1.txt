the first   episodes of season   are just to throw up  to predictable and the worst scenario i ve seen  won t and hopefully i din t buy it  also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did  suck even more  all i want to say to the people who make this is  don t do whole episode about space  because they suck  the point is that season   sucks even more than the seasons before  gets worse from season to season  i got so disappointed and frustrated watching first   episodes of season   that i just had to write this  only people who are brain washed can watch this crap  seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time  think that my   year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do
