agreed this movie is well shot but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made   hours seem like   just over a small love story   this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o c in short please don t watch this movie because there is a song every   minutes just to wake you up from you re sleep i gave this movie   cause that was the lowest and no this is not based completely on a true story more than half of it is made up i repeat the direction of photography is   or   out of  but the movie is just a little too much the actor s nasal voice just makes me want to go blow my nose unless you are a real him mesh fan this movie is a huge no no
