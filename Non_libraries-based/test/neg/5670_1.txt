  with her brainless friends  one of which owns equipment that the producers of this show probably couldn t afford  her legal guardian is some kind of moron who is apparently her older brother   i haven t watched all of this show for fear of developing cancer  or perhaps a cold  but some of the plot points i have seen involve the brother getting stuck in an elevator  the doorman of the apartment almost dieing  and the world s fattest priest coming for a visit  no  really   avoid this if you are over the age of unborn or if you have a history of joining mysterious cults due to mental trauma  if you do decide to watch it  laugh when the laugh track tells you to  as this will drown out the repetitive noise that will eventually put you in a coma if you listen to it for too long    the show receives a one star rating because the imdb inexplicably has not adopted the use of negative numbers
