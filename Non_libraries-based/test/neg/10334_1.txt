but certainly a serious contender for one of the worst   of all time   i got this dvd cheap  with sandra bullock as headliner on the case  this is false advertising   she s on screen for almost   minutes of the movie   on the other hand  there was no other selling point for this movie   the dialog was horrible  the editing was apparently done by someone who was strung out on quaaludes  the directing was   well  let s just say that my  yo daughter could do better  but i hope she never sees such faint praise from me  it s possible that the family cat could have done better   sandra does a creditable job for a first film  in the short time she s on screen   and that s the only redeeming quality of this film  stupid story  poorly written  and transferred to film as only a  th grade media class should be able to do   in short  this is dreck
