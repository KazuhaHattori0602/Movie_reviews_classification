i loved all the other don knotts movies  but i never heard much about  how to frame a fig  and now i know why  i can t think of anyone who would find it enjoyable  this movie seems to appeal to   or   year olds  but even most of them would give this a thumbs down  at best there are brief moments of mild amusement  mostly from don knotts playing the same nervous  underdog persona that made him famous   after the movie finally finished i was curious if my teenager could pick up on this movie s fatal flaw  we were in complete agreement  the prentiss gates sidekick character was even dumber than the don knotts character   be happy that mr  limpet  reluctant astronaut  shakiest gun and mr  chicken movies are around to enjoy
