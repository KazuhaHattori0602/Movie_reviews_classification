before i really slag this film off  i just want to say i absolutely loved it    firstly  how many times in the film did the characters use the phrase  you re right  i m sure i was counting in the hundreds before i gave up and started watching the film again   secondly  what the hell is with those blue monkey things  ok  so the dansen family led very private lives and had one brown eye one blue eye  but since when does that transform people into subterranean carnivorous blue zombie creatures   and finally   old faithful here will protect me  hahaha
