the movie was actually not that bad  especially plot wise  but the doughy  and hairy  actor they chose for the leading role was a little chintzy in the acting department  i would have chosen someone else  the idea of  going to america  was very ingenious  and the main character questioning everything that he d ever known made him somewhat likable  but not very much so when there s a pasty blob for a leading actor   the storyline was interesting  it brings about the question of how the subject of cloning will be handled in the future  certainly cloning wouldn t be allowed for the purposes in the movie  but it s still a valid argument even for today  clones are still people  right   the movie wasn t particularly special  but it still is a lot better than some of the cheese released during the  s  let us not forget the  giant spider invasion  i give it a   since it didn t totally stink  but the mst k version makes this movie a    i still like dr  super mario  you ll like this movie  but it won t be your favorite
