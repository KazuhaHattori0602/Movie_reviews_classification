well this movie is really  plumped  haha get it  thats kinda like the attitude of this movie  the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction okay thats acceptable but to make this piece if  plump   haha  is really unbelievable the storyline is so pathetic and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs  it did try making a few jokes from various other movies and it failed most of the times  i mean i do have a sense of humor but this isnt really the way to go to get a laugh  most of the supposedly  funny  moments are completely ironic  the film is quiet short running at around   minutes overall  they could have done a much funnier job seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film they were gambling and hey  i think they lost   in overall plump fiction is  plumpable  but you wont gather much at all   worth watching over and over again  no once is enough actually its more than enough   so is it worth the rent  ummm as i said its  plumpable but you will only gather a few  plumps  from it   overall out of   a   out of
