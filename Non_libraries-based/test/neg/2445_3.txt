genre  cartoon short with no dialogue  african girl and lion   main characters  inki  the lion and the minah bird    what happens  a lion wants to eat an african girl called inki  there is also a rather confusing minah bird  is he on inki s  or the lion s side   message  erm
  my thoughts  i agree with lee eisenberg  this is rather mean on poor african people    i like how the main character  inki  who is an african girl  is quite a nice main character  but they still portray her rudely and make a younger audience not like her very much just because she s hunting  grrr charles m  jones  i don t like the lion very much and i think the minah bird is all right  i suppose  personally i prefer charles m  jones s looney tunes cartoons in the future   if you want to watch this anyway  then i recommend the website youtube  just type in  inki  on the space in the main page and you re there    i wish charles m  jones had been nicer to inki in this short  so there    recommended to  people who are interested in old cartoons and or people who are just messing around on you tube
