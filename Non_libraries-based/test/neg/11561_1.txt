robot holocaust is about the lamest  most pathetic attempt at making a post apocalyptic movie that i ve seen  and i thought the italians were the masters of wretched mad max wannabes  some of those movies like escape   are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo  the plot is nonsensical   even with a narrator setting up every scene  and boy does it drag  scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening  the special effects  and i use the word  special  loosely  consist of sock puppets  yes  that s right   sock puppets  the acting is abysmal  angelika jager is in the running for worst performance i ve ever seen  sure  she s french or german or whatever   but man is she bad  i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie  so i ll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many   however  and fortunately for me  i saw the mst k version of robot holocaust  some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this mst k episode a winner  for a season one episode  the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time  on my mst k rating scale  i give this episode a     seek it out
