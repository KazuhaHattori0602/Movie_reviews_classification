why would burt lancaster allow himself to play a poor schnook who is ultimately undermined by femme fatale anna dundee  played by yvonne decarlo in  criss cross  the same reason why robert mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls for femme fatale faith domergue in the   noir   where danger lives  perhaps they both felt it was a good way to show that they had  range  as actors that playing against type  the usual  tough guy  role they were known for  would enhance their image as actors who could play any role  but the problem was that roles like steve thompson  the pathetic love sick milquetoast in  criss cross  did nothing to enhance lancaster s career  not only is lancaster completely miscast in the one note role of thompson  but there s something inherently unlikeable  and may i say  pathetic  about the film s protagonist in the first place    criss cross  is an interminably slow moving film  among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is at the beginning  the flashback which chronicles thompson s confrontation with dan duryea s dundee at the nightclub  everything that occurs in that initial flashback is explained later in the picture  the illicit affair between steve and anna  steve s strained relationship with martinez the cop and his bad blood with dundee  if director siodmark felt compelled to begin the film with a flashback  why not keep it under three minutes  i think it would have been more effective   in  criss cross  it takes quite awhile before the protagonist commits himself and steps out of the  ordinary  world of act one  that s the scene where he s  passing by  and  runs into  anna at the nightclub  and notice how siodmak spends so much time cutting back and forth between anna dancing and steve staring at her  in addition to the cross cutting  he also spends a great deal of time focusing on esy morales and his rhumba band than moving the story along   up until the crisis of act two  the story plods along with thompson having various uneasy encounters with anna and then drowning his sorrows at his usual watering hole  at the midpoint of act two  he learns that anna has run off and gotten married to dundee  it s becoming more clear at this point that one of the film s central weaknesses is that dundee is never on screen throughout most of the second act  there are no confrontations between thompson and dundee during this time and we re left with the rather unexciting machinations between the two lovebirds  as it turns out  and anna  explains  this later to steve  the reason why she left was not only because he disappeared for eight months but she also felt pressure from steve s mother as well direct threats from martinez the cop who implied that he would see to it that she ended up in the women s house of detention  anna goes back to steve because she realizes she made a big mistake with dundee it turns out that he s been beating her and she s now scared of him   one of the silly refrains uttered by more than one character in criss cross is that you can never hijack an armored car  but everyone acts so surprised when steve points out it can be done if it s an  inside job  you would have thought that dundee would have known about steve s  profession  as an armored car driver and propositioned him beforehand  but of course steve needs to make the proposal so that dundee won t kill him after discovering his affair with anna  if they re so afraid at getting caught  why do steve and anna meet at his apartment where dundee can so easily find them  i really got a kick out of finchley  played by alan napier  the  brains  of the operation  dundee is so dumb that he has to hire this alcoholic ex professor type who plots out the heist on a map  oh there is the matter of procuring the ingredients to construct the gas bombs used during the robbery and of course finchley is good at that too   the only really well done scene in the entire film is the armored car robbery  the editing was quite good as it depicted the rising action of a heist gone bad  as the gas bombs go off  the brutality of the gang is shown in high relief when dundee murders the innocent armored car guard   the climax of the film is as drawn out as the rest of the film  why does it take so long for one of dundee s goons to kidnap thompson  there s that nurse  then the goon is waiting outside  then he comes in and pretends that he s a friend  steve falls asleep and finally after he awakes  the goon kidnaps him   when steve finally meets up with anna at the house  we wonder how anna got her hands on the cash  did she somehow steal it from dundee after the heist when he went out to dinner  it s never explained  even worse  anna suddenly becomes the evil femme fatale out of the blue  before  her selfishness and attraction to dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection at the hands of steve and martinez s threats  but after going back to steve because she fears dundee  she inexplicably turns on him when he is most vulnerable  just as there is  instant coffee  you have  instant femme fatale   in  film noir an encyclopedic reference to the american style  by silver and ward  the authors hail  criss by cross  as  one of the most tragic and compelling of film noir  i beg to differ  in order to have tragedy you need characters that have great depth and in order to be compelling you need a story that s plausible  criss cross has neither  it s an overrated  b movie  that somehow has found itself in the pantheon of art house noirs  once again  the herd mentality has triumphed in evaluating the pictures of yesteryear
