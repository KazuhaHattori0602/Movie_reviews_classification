 pletely on purpose  see i aspire to be a movie reviewer  and as we all know there are horrible movies released every year  anyway  about   months ago i rented this one  i watched it all the way through and cried profusely  this is one of those movies that is so freakin bad it makes you want to puke  it actually put a sick feeling in my stomach  i ve seen lots of bad movies  mystery science theater   anyone  but this one takes the cake  the plot was hard to follow  the lighting horrible and the sounds almost inaudible  if there was a negative rating on the scale here this movie would be at   for me  this may seem odd  but i highly recommend it  it s something you have to see for yourself but don t say i didn t warn you  i don t think this review could get any more precise so i m done now
