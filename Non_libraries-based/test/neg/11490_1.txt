i have not seen and heard the original version   i am no russian  but i am learning right now   i also have no preferences for russia  bulgaia  the us etc   but what i have to mention is   in the german synchronisation in the whole film all russians speak with russian accent  americans talk  hochdeutsch   without accent  i have never heard such a stupidity  besides  this is boring   i hope the original is better   the rest is a simple thriller  not really good ideas  like a cheap version of a james bond film
