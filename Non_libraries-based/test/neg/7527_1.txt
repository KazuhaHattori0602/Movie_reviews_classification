the   version of  the time machine  is just the latest in a string of terribly disappointing hollywood remakes that fall flat on their face despite extravagant special effects    what a lousy  uninspired bland story  with no imagination  why so totally rewrite such a wonderful sci fi classic  are today s movie audiences too hip for the h g  wells writing largely as is  the   george pal version told a much more endearing story  even with clunky low budget effects  beach party looking eloi  and morlocks that looked like smurfs on steroids   the   version must have h g wells turning in his grave     the idea that the time traveler is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is an old sci fi clich  this totally distracts from the love affair with mara  what happened to weena  that made the   version so endearing  this sets an unfortunate and distractive tone early on that makes the whole movie dour  if guy pearce s character was so brilliant either he or his buddy einstein would have realized the time paradox dilemma   not have it dawn on him   yrs in the future   from a morlock no less  doh  what s wrong with time traveling just for fun   adventure   curiosity   as embodied in the   version     only if you saw the first movie would you realize at all what pearce was doing with the time machine when you first see it  the george pal film carefully explains the whole weird idea of  travel  though a  th dimension     the director goes out of his way to make pearce s character look geeky  a worn out old stereotype of scientists  in the   version rod taylor was a little nerdy too  at least around weena  but managed to be swashbuckling  playful and charming     among the key themes of the  s version   abandoned in the remake   is the idea that endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity  blowing up the moon to destroy humanity is pointless   and doesn t do much for science literacy  for over   billion years the moon has suffered vastly more powerful asteroid impacts  which would make any nuclear device look like a firecracker  yes  science fiction needs artistic license  but this is just plain dumb and meaningless     destroying the time machine is stupid too  apparently our time traveler invented the neutron bomb to power this thing  blowing up the machine to kill morlocks is sort of a cop out  machina ex machina  disappointingly  pearce never comes back to the  s to tell his tale to his incredulous friends  a key part of the wells story with the irony that in a week the time travels goes into the far future and back     having morlocks running around in the daytime totally ruins h g  wells  wonderfully spooky  ghoulish portrayal of them as shadowy creatures of the night  a true cinematic opportunity lost  also  wells depicted the eloi as frail and childlike  these guys in the movie looked like they could take on morlocks  if they weren t such big baby wusses     the one smart morlock   kind of a bleached out star wars evil emperor   had potential  but is so lame and aloof he tells pearce to take his machine and go home   boy  what a dramatic high point  in the book the morlocks steal the machine because they are so fascinated by it  and fight to keep it     the goof ball hologram at the n y  public library is too much  it makes light of the idea of human cannibalism  the   version simply had the  talking rings  that delivered a chillingly somber eulogy for humankind  derailed evolution is serious stuff   its sad the wonderful effects in this movie can never make up for a weary contrived clunker of a script  save the cost of a ticket   popcorn and go rent the dvd when it comes out  soon no doubt  at least you can fast forward thought the dull parts  just like our time traveler
