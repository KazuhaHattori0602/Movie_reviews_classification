what offends me most about the critics following this film is the mentioning of  originality  this film does not contain one innovating element  if  by  originality  you refer to pathetic action scenes  overacting  gluttony in violence  blunt humor and a script beyond intellectual belief  then   originality  is something swedish film can do without   how r se and karlsson can agree to  act  in this poor excuse for a film is a mystery to me  and how eva r se after the making of this film can be seen at breakfast tv promoting it just disappoints me   this film doesn t contain a story  the script is illogical  stiff and last but not least  just plain bad  these two young directors have put together a quite disgusting boy fantasy containing violence  comic strips and trivialized psychological portraits  i wouldn t be surprised if the scene of dd masturbating in the kitchen over a micro wave dinner actually is put there to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown cinematic nerds that pose as directors   i wouldn t show this movie to my worst enemy
