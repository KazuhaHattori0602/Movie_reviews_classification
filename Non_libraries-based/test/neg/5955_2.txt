there is a reason why the world forgot these creatures  they are dull  this is a hammer production which means that whoever made this movie should be struck with a hammer  several times if possible   and where it most hurts  most people put more thought into taking a dump than these idiots have put into making this movie   seriously now
 the movie begins with some cavemen hunting an antelope thing  now  antelopes must have evolved a lot from those pre historic times because they actually attack and kill people here  after that  it s time to meet the rest of the tribe  more bearded men  some fashion models  and even a couple of very old  grey haired grannies and grandpas  these old geezers obviously never heard about cave people not surpassing the age of   they refused to bow to the will of both logic and pre historical records  so they remain alive  one of the cavemen isn t bearded  he is clean shaven  not quite as clean shaven as tarzan  the lord of the humanoid clean shaven ones roaming the jungle since childhood and without a razor  but thereabouts   what follows is the obligatory earthquake molten lava destruction sequence which causes a lot of our not so hairy friends to meet their doom  it is interesting to note that before the earthquake the fashion models showed their breasts more  after it  they must have gotten shy or something  because they covered their chests for a while  maybe they were covered by ash so i mistakenly thought they were covered  more action follows in the form of two fashion models wrestling in the sand  the next best thing to female mud wrestling  i suppose  after a good deal of the desert has been crossed  our black haired tribe meets   how else could it be   a blond tribe  yawn   more spellbinding stuff follows  there is that redhead fashion model who is bothered by seeing a cave teen kill a hedge hog thing  there is also the scene of a woman dying at birth  those cave fashion models are so frail  eventually we get to meet an even darker  haired and  skinned tribe  i e  an evil tribe  one of them becomes a wwf champion after he actually beats  a huge bear thing in a wrestling bout    and it s done  the bear is the loser  we also witness a jealous caveman miraculously recover from two major injuries  first he gets stabbed with a big spear into the thigh  yet he walks away from that as if it were but a scratch  then he gets thrown off a cliff   onto a big rock   by the blond goodie two shoes caveman  yet he walks away from it as if he were thrown onto a giant sofa  it s unclear in the end whether he dies from falling off an even higher cliff or from that voodoo doll being crushed  oh yes  voodoo was used in pre historic times by white tribes that live in the desert and whose females were fashion models  it s always important to learn from movies   the message of the movie is as insightful as it is educational  cave people liked to fight for local power and they loved their fashion models  too  as if any self respecting caveman would fight to be leader of such a sorry bunch
