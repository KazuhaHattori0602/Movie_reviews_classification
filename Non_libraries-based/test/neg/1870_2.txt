i don t know why imdb lists all the ghoulies films as theatrical releases  they were all straight to video films  same with the puppet master series  why hasn t anyone noticed this yet  right  somehow you ve stumbled across ghoulies iv  probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from   you looked in the discount section and found this look at the back and front covers  what do you expect  the shawshank redemption  there is no need to review this film so critically  it is the fourth ghoulies film  i bought it on dvd for   because  it was   i knew it wasn t kubrick material  and i was right  an unremastered dvd with no extras  not even a trailer  boasts an uncared for film   it actually contains the star of the first ghoulies film  peter liapis  who really didn t get many  big  roles apart from those two films  and i don t see why  he s not too bad an actor and is pretty fun  but i guess if you re gonna take a lead role in the ghoulies films  scorsese and tarantino will lose interest  also present is his idiot sidekick bobby di cocco  who despite having a very small resemblance to al pacino  very small  retains none of his acting ability  a complete idiot who s just awkward to watch  then there s stacie randall   obviously a porn star  i don t need to look that up  she does look quite sexy  though her costume  her character and everything she does drags down the films credibility  which is no easy task for such a film   then there is the ghoulies themselves  who also manage to let us down  ghoulies iii made them start talking  mistake no    but ghoulies iv takes it a step further  instead of being puppets  this time the ghoulies are in fact kids in costumes  the filmmakers decided to run that extra mile to insult the films viewers  also  there s only two of them  and they re not the main highlight of the film  as they don t appear in a lot of it  however  at times they are mildly amusing  and they re not evil this time either   this really is hilariously bad stuff  it s amazing that i was actually able to enjoy it  i dunno why  some of the black humour is actually funny  though the script is mostly effortless  imagine satan s only threat to you being that he will  kill you  slowly painfully   but at least full moon had no involvement this time  did they  yeah  a very bad and cheaply made film with   production value  but not so bad as to be in the ranks of puppet master   lawnmower man   surviving christmas or even ghoulies iii
