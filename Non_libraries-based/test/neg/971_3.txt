minor plot spoilers ahead   how did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded  drivel  robert deniro plays a dumb hollywood version of the standard  violence prone tough cop  i e  he beats up the bad guys and rolls his  eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book  and eddie murphy plays a  not so tough cop who would rather be an actor  i e  he screams out    freeze  police  and has his  tough look  down pat  naturally  they  are partnered when bobby s loose cannon tactics get him in hot water  with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a   cops like reality show  take a breath  cuz that s as funny as it  gets   no energy was put into the script   it feels like a pale retread of  every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with   minutes  starring   yes  deniro himself as  pretty much the character he is playing here    the jokes fall flat  the action feels listless  and no one seems to be  having a good time  it s dead on the screen   please don t waste your time  even if you have an overwheming affinity  for one of the actors   avoid it and do them a favor  becauze if this  makes money  these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable  for actors of their quality   and to mr  deniro  you used to make serious films  i remember them    they were good  you were nominated for awards for them   remember how  much fun that was  now after  analyze this   which was good   meet the  parents   which was also good  and  the adventures of rocky and  bullwinkle   which was not good  i think we need to see you parodying  yourself less  and being yourself more   casino  feels like a long time  ago  and no  i don t count   minutes  as serious bobby  anyone who  took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
