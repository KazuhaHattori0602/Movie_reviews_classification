dreadful  a friend of mine  who obviously thought i had an abysmal sense of humour  recommended this   it s bobbins  i almost switched it off  it is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so   this was evidently a british attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran tv actors using some lame script from their mate in the business  i struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie  less funny than global warming   i m not normally so vehement  but i watched this well over ten years ago and thought that i wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive   puerile  plot less  useless tosh   i d rather eat my feet than watch it again
