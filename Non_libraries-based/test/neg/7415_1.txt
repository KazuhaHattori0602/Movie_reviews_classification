i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen  there s like fade out every two minutes  if this was on tv  they would have a preview every   minutes  but there is a seen i personally enjoyed  which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about   seconds you see her whole body with no towel on  that was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last   minutes is when we see his whole body  plus  most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or roar  and i was expecting the sasquatch to die  but he dosen t shoot him and only   or   people die in the whole film i was expecting   people to die  don t watch this movie  i give it an f  don t waste your time
