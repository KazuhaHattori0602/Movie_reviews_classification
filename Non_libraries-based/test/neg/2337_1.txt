some directors take   and a half hours to tell a story  david lynch takes   and a half hours to piece together scenes with  clues  and his trademark oddity  but there s never a story  no plot  no progression of the characters  unless you find revealed delusion a  progression  it amazes me how anyone can call lynch s garbage  art  but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder  so be it  lynch s movie and tv work in the  s came off as  avant garde  and  alternative  fine    years later  work like  mulholland drive  comes off as a   hour david lynch masturbation piece  it s embarrasing  i ve finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever  at least the people churning out  godzilla  and  rodan  weren t passing them off as  art
