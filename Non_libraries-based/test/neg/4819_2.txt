new orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this  debacle of a film  quaid s attempt at speaking with a cajun  accent  by the way  hardly anyone speaks that way in new  orleans  is terrible  plot   elementary and mindless  this  picture refers to itself as a mystery  but a mystery involves a  gradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film  there s none of that here   big  easy  tries to get by on trite new orleans stereotypes    don t be fooled   the real big easy is nothing like the town  that quaid   barkin bumble their way through
