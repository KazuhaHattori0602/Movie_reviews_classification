the adventures of hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie i ve yet run across  you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie  acting   bad  editing   bad  direction   bad  special effects   bad and laughable  plot   bad  lighting   bad  cinematography   bad  costume design   bad and silly  everything else   bad  watching the adventures of hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal  even for a fan of bad movies  it s a real endurance test  this is one for either masochists or lou ferrigno completists  if any exist   eight things i learned from watching the adventures of hercules      if you don t have the budget for real special effects  rotoscope a scene from the previous movie  it will look great   trust me     when on a quest to recover zeus  thunderbolts  take time for frequent stops to oil up you body  it worked for ferrigno and his two amazon companions     any sword fight  use of magic  and just about all other day to day activities in ancient greece created a sound very similar to a game of pac man or asteroids     some of the ancient greek gods dressed like extras from star wars     if you need to pad your crappy movie s runtime  extend the title sequence by adding star trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music  it also helps if you ve got a previous movie to pull scenes from     fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack hercules one at a time     william berger did anything for money     i didn t think it was possible  but the adventures of hercules makes the first film  hercules   look like an academy award winner
