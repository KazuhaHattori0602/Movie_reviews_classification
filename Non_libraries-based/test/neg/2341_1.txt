like most  i rented this after i heard the universal praise  and despite countless bizarre  unexplainable moments along the way  i was very interested and entertained through   minutes of the film  then the two women went to the  performance  late at night  the rest of movie  which is another   minutes by the way  is even weirder than the first part and completely contradict and dump on what i had already seen  then the movie abruptly ends   baffled  i wandered over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened  nothing made sense  and i m a pretty clever guy  none of these other user comments made sense  even when they say  spoilers  i still have no idea what they re saying  someone s dream  not real  then what s the point of a   hour   minute movie if it s  not real  or is it real  i m forced to make a choice  either   [a] the movie is a work of genius on a mensa level and i m simply too stupid to understand it   [b] the movie is weird for weird s sake and just doesn t make sense  everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they  get  it   i choose [b]  screw you guys  i m going home
