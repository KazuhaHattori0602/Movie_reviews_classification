great music  but ain t these people pathetic  a true period piece of the trippy sixties  and it left me depressed  the director paints the wrong side of the jetset life and it stings as a hornets nest  if the culture of the time led people to do these things  it appears to me that it was all a journey of no discovery  only despair  i tried  really tried  to like this film  but these people aren t anywhere on my page  yes  it would be nice to see the world  go away for awhile  but i always plan to come back  drugs aren t the cause of these characters  downfalls  it s their lousy attitudes   these guys passionately drink their cup of poison  they cheapen their lives  and in the end  cheapen the journey that is life  has romance ever been so dark   cheers  interesting scenery  wonderful soundtrack by pink floyd   caveats  dated  drugs  depressing  thoroughly unlikable characters  they aren t flower children   only for the curious  since most packages swoon the pink floyd connection    rare floyd tracks many will have never heard before  as fm ain t what it was     rating  two stars
