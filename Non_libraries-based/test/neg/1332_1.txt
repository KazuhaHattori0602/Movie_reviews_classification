woa  talk about awful  do not waste your time  i wish i had seen the other use comments first    i have to admit  i didn t watch the whole thing  it was just too horrible  the worst  sappiest dialogue  i could go on and on  but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  the poor actors  you can t even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  if you check the director s filmography on this site you will see why this film didn t have a chance    this would not even be good as a made for tv flick    ouch
