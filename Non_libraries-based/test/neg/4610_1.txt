the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie  the acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was revolting  the effects were marginal at best  there were no stand out performances  amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h  audience  the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying  i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years   best so far it is at the bottom of my list  don t bother with this one folks
