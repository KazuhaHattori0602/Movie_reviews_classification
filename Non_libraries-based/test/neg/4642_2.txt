okay  granted  i am a fan of low budget horror  which along with it  does come the occasional piece of garbage that even the most diehard fan of campy flicks can not bare to stand witness to trancers   directed by demonicus s jay woelfel   first of all  the trancers series  started back in the mid s by charlie band and his empire pictures  is basically the franchise that it is because of tim thomerson and his excellent portrayal of trancer hunter jack deth  well  low and behold  due to the sinking budgets of full moon features  which  despite what people have said  have actually brought along very high quality features  such as hell asylum and dead   rotting  thomerson did not return for the sixth installment   full moon writer courtney joyner returns once again and delivers another below average screenplay  which features jack deth  played by thomerson in flashbacks  which are extremely poorly inserted he has a different hair style like every time he is shown  and some `shemp  laying on a table  going down the line into his daughter s body  well  from here on out  you have  jo deth  acting like jack but its a shame that she really doesn t give off the same screen presence as jack deth did   the film  shot on  mm  is  simply put  an embarrassment to the trancers name no offense to anyone at young wolf productions  i mean  i respect you guys for actually wanting to jump forth and do a trancers film without tim  but with a little more time  despite it being filmed since december of   it could have been better   however  check out full moon s dvd of it  which is a double feature with the original trancers  and features trailers for the last   plus full moon features   overall  i would probably have liked the feature more if it wouldn t have the trancers name  but like anything  you can judge it by someone s opinion and you must check it out for yourself
