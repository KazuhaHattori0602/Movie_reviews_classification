i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the   blockbuster movie  far north  and even though i loved her in her one other film  slow    where she plays  francis  this is by far and away her strongest role   lynn  as i m sure you all know  or should  plays the critical role of  driver   unfortunately  other than lynn s amazing performance  i m afraid this movie doesn t really have much going for it   oh wait   there was one other thing   the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers  memorable lines like   you son of a gun   you son of a witch   shoot  and  well  forget you   o k  bye   p s  does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster
