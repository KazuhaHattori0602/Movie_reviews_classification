they must be  i ll list them so that you can check them off one by one     police regularly leave tens of millions of dollars of cash and drugs just lying around  because they don t have evidence facilities     when you get shot  you always grunt the same way  and fly back the same way  even though there s never a mark on your body     police are not able to identify the sound of gun shots  and don t think anything is suspicious when an undercover policewoman s phone call during a high level drug and money deal is cut shot by that gun shot     bad guy gunmen can hit mannequins with one shot  but can t hit a big  bulky martial artist with      if you rocket launcher a car in a car park  the next three cars in a line will blow up evenly in   second intervals     further to the last point  all the cheap cars are always parked next to each other     the smoke that is caused from the firing of the rocket launcher is much greater than the amount of smoke caused by four cars blowing up     virtual reality games that are a long  long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce fit on five floppy disks     virtual reality games that are a long  long way ahead of anything any other gaming company can produce have graphics that look like windows   screen savers     floppy disks can be read even after they ve been shot up     semi drunk guys in bars attentively watch the news when they re at the pub  and have a deep understanding of american modern military history  agent orange  and the family trees of high ranking military officials  however  they re only able to articulate their points using dialogue that sounds silly coming from anyone over the age of seven     even though fights appear to break out almost hourly in a bar  that bar has only one staff worker  who both pours the beers and handles security  of course he knows martial arts     gold medal olympians regularly make the simple transition to corporate ceos of software companies in a matter of years     a woman who works for a computer game company knows everything about how to beat a game she s never played  raves constantly about her competitor s great games  and can rattle off facts and figures regarding her company s rivals   but she didn t know that they overtook almost all the other companies in the field in large corporate mergers     bad guys always die in slow motion  always     wives tell their husbands that they re pregnant by raving about their man s bravery in killing bad guys     wives do large amounts of their husband s police work  this might explain why she whines and complains so much every time he has to go to work  although  it doesn t explain why she adores him so much every time he gets up in the morning and she can read about his murderous escapades     it s fairly typical for a police officer to be involved in kidnappings  kill tons of people on three separate occasions and stop a variety of multi million dollar illegal deals in a week     when trying to lose a car that s following you  it s wise to continue driving under the speed limit  and if you re following a cop  subtlety is not important   you can tailgate him for miles  then park right next to him  he won t notice     all cops are experienced martial artists     it is possible to kick a guy four metres in distance     people scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kick  yet when they have their arm broken  they don t make a sound     bad guys clean their bloodied axes with their handkerchiefs  and then leave them in their pocket for many days     pieces of wood  when swung with one sharp blow  shatter sturdy ladders in six or more places simultaneously     the photo  and listed special features on the back of the dvd case don t necessarily have to be on the dvd  the advertised interactive menus  why not no menu at all  the advertised scene index  why not have the whole thing as one scene chapter  and not need an index  likewise  it s ok to use the matrix s font and title in the tag line  and not be a rip off in any way   with all of this  i m in shock that   out of the   top credited actors never acted again
