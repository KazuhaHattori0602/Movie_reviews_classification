like another user i got this cheap   i thought    kroners   although not worth that amount of money it is a total classic that i   like the other users   first saw when i was a kid and was looking forward to seeing again some   years after  the story is amazingly thin  which is why it might have worked for kids  but all the radio language and trucker stuff makes up for it  it ll look good on my dvd shelf in years to come  first viewing     second viewing
