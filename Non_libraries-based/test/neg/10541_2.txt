yeah  a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction  now it s a prison again  kind of  well  it s more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits  so i guess in that way it s like a prison  not really though  when sasha  steven seagal s character  is being admitted into prison  he s standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend  like he s in line for the security check at the airport  then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches  smacking around a couple of security guards   let me tell you something  you assault a corrections officer in a federal prison  they ll shoot you on the spot  ja rule would have been shot about   times before he threw his second punch  oh  and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot  in prison  federal prison   you can t dress like that at most high schools in america   speaking of ja rule  i have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth  including ja rule himself  had to have been   cent  just before i watched this movie i saw one of those shows on tv about the greatest celebrity feuds ever  and like number   or   was this rivalry between   cent  who had lived the thug life for real  and ja rule  who had not  every time i saw ja rule on screen the only thing i could picture was   cent laughing his ass off  ja rule looks like a rowdy  year old every time he appears on screen   anyway  getting back to the plot  it s funny  sasha is an fbi agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization  he s sentenced to five years  and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes  nothing else in the movie matters after that  it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences  most of which aren t even well choreographed   oh  how about this  a helicopter crashes through the roof of  new alcatraz  at one point  accidentally freeing all of the inmates  and what do they do  they all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block  without so much as a basket  they had a ball  but it doesn t matter  the scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch   so some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in alcatraz s state of the art execution chamber  evidently not for stealing   million dollars in gold  but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught   hey  good thinking  people  if you can t get information out of someone  kill them  that s a great way to learn the truth  so some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the   million for themselves   oh and the   million is in gold bricks  i doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency   there s also the issue of the warden at the prison  he s some tough talking vato who thinks he s a hardcore chollo from the barrio  which reminds me of a joke  i saw this comedian once talking about people in california who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense  these people go to mexico  the comedian says  and they re like   oh my god  people live there  that s like  a total shack   the best is when the united states supreme court justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can t carry their guns inside his prison   i don t care if she is a united states supreme court justice   this woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he s in charge  ha   and by the way  the supreme court justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is   that s a year younger than steven seagal  i just thought that was funny   the only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where ja rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little asian woman  that was the funniest thing i ve seen in a movie in a long  long time   you know  i work for the company that produced this film  which i why i watched it  and i still don t have a single positive thing to say about it  except  of course  for that one scene with ja rule getting spanked by that asian woman   so read my review of malena and you will see how strongly i sometimes disagree with professional film critics like roger ebert  but in his review of this movie ebert wrote something that i agreed with as much as anything else he s ever written    i imagine the flywheels at the mpaa congratulating each other on a good day s work as they rated  half past dead  pg  after giving the anti gun movie  bowling for columbine  an r   way to go  guys
