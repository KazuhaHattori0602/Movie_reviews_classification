   you find asian americans who are so elated that an asian character can be depicted onscreen without thick glasses and a math book  that they somehow neglect the idiocy of lee s final product  on the other hand  you find movie critics who have simply presumed that it d be uncool to give `yellow  the thorough bashing that it deserves  after all  it s an edgy asian american film made by an independent asian american filmmaker  protected territory for now   case example  main character sin lee  michael chung  writer director lee accomplishes a monumental feat with sin  by editing `yellow  in such a way that sin never appears onscreen unless he is either scowling or yelling  see sin resenting his friends  support  scowl  see sin walk along the beach and brood  scowl   yelling ensues  see sin closing up his father s shop  scowl  see sin urinating  scowl  see sin breathing  scowl   gee  i wonder if sin is full of asian american angst  do you think  i m not sure  scowl  scowl   just to be thorough  lee introduces us to sin s father  woon lee  soon tek oh  throughout the movie  whereas sin simply scowls or yells  mr  lee scowls  and  yells  in fact  this is woon s principal role in `yellow  simultaneous scowling and yelling   gee  i wonder if woon is an asian father with an authority complex  do you think  i m not sure  scowl  yell   if lee s one dimensional characters don t annoy you  his story line will  meet mina  mary chen  and joey  john cho  two characters that exist in this film solely for the purpose of spinning a tangential and entirely irrelevant love story into the film  you see  lee learned in film school that every good movie must include some sort of love related subtext  and these two characters allow him to fulfill the obligation  mina and joey s excruciatingly inane flirting dialogue consists of one liner insults culminating in a kiss  `nerd  `stupidhead   eyes meet   understanding smile   kissing ensues   but rest assured  somewhere out there  sin is scowling while this all takes place   that neither mina nor joey contributes in any way whatsoever to the film s plot does not perplex me so much as lee s insistence on the most hackneyed movie cliches to accomplish his nonsequiturs  and trust me  the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg   towards the end of the film  we find woon lee attempting to explain his constant scowling and yelling to sin s girlfriend  teri  mia suh  in what i am sure lee meant to be a poignant moment  what a surprise  as woon invokes a metaphorical story about the homeland to illustrate his point  ripped straight out of reader s digest  his voice quivers in that extra special paternal way  the camera pans into an obligatory shot of teri s trembling hands  we feel compelled to roll our eyes  except we realize that woon s explanation makes no sense whatsoever  but lack of substance didn t stop lee from making the movie  so why would he cut this particularly ineffective scene  after all  the world can always use another clich   well  you say  the movie may be painful  but at least it  must  be a technical masterpiece   say  like  `what dreams may come  sorry  on a technical basis  `yellow  disappoints as well  lee s edits are awkward and disrupt what little rhythm exists in the film at all  but i m sure lee thought they would seem hip  to make matters worse  every frame is either underexposed or overexposed  although the light meter was invented in   somehow the newfangled technology didn t make it onto the `yellow  set   in light of the film s utter deficiency  supporting actor burt bolos  who plays sin s best friend alex  performs relatively well  although bolos overacts slightly  you can t really blame him when lee s script consists solely of scowling and yelling  bolos  castmates  on the other hand  show no restraint in their overacting whatsoever   i have not seen a film as bad as `yellow  in a very long time  and i truly pray that i will not see a film as bad as `yellow  for quite some time  as well  please do not waste see it  life is already way too short  thank you
