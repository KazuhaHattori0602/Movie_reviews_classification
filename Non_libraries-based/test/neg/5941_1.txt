i loved this movie  it s the finest parody of russian cinema to date  who else but sokurov could lampoon tarkovsky so brilliantly  you thought  stalker  was slow  well  step up to the plate   mat i syn  makes  stalker  look like  raiders of the lost ark  by no means should you miss this film  there s no excuse   even if you live a busy life  you can still enjoy this film to its fullest by holding down the fast forward button on your vcr  sokurov has given us the first feature length film that can be appreciated in   minutes   i suppose the next great masterpiece of the form will come when someone has the vision and courage to exhibit a film that consists of no sound or image at all     minutes of a black  silent screen  wasn t this already explored in  in the soup   apparently the filmmaker  and fans  have forgotten that  motion  is the first word of  motion picture    major spoilers ahead   want to reach the heights of genius that this film achieved  here s a step by step guide     find a talented photographer     find some subjects and a suitably picturesque landscape  think tuscany  if you need inspiration  watch some luxury car or perfume commercials     shoot about   rolls of film     photoshop the results to play around with saturation  blur   aspect ratio     now just get out your movie camera  film   of the best pictures and have your  actors  mumble their lines off screen  don t worry about writing it ahead of time   just let the actors say whatever they want  lines like  do you want a drink  and  let s get something to eat  are really all you need to fill up   minutes or so  if you can t think of enough dialog   no problem  just have them repeat what they say a few times  if that still isn t enough  just let the camera run anyway   congratulations  another masterpiece  as a bonus  if you want to distribute it over the internet  no problem  the static images will compress down to nothing with standard mpeg encoding   a   minute movie would probably be about   megabytes  even at the highest quality levels
