i ve seen a few bad action movies in my days  but this one s just plain awful  i feel it s a waste of time to even write this but i ll make it short  why this movie suck  here are   reasons    very amateurly directed and cut    bad bad bad acting of the whole cast    silly dialogs and too many clich s    too many plot holes  a lot of scenes don t add up    bad photographing  and a lot of continuity issues    ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress    unreliable action scenes  and not too good  either    even for a snipes movie  he shows a big lack of acting materials    outrageous accents  of all the cast    last  but not least   too many implausible facts  such as a tournament of soccer in the u s  cia needing to do background checks to get new information about their employees  a mattress that is explosion proof and so on  in essence   it s a waste of time  it s not funny  not entertaining  not even as a joke   don t watch it  seriously  just don t
