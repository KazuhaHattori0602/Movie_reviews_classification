this is based on michael s life from   till   flex alexander did a good performance but looked nothing like michael  i feel michael was portrayed as a stupid person which i don t believe he was  even though he trusted the wrong people at times  i thought flex alexander looked chinese when they made michael look white  i think latoya should of been portrayed in this  she was always pictured with her brother in the  s  i never thought any of the supporting cast looked like their counterparts  there were some things that were inaccurate lisa marie presley s son looked about   in the wedding scene even though he was not yet   when lisa and michael got married  also when michael says to his mother katherine he thinks he and debbie should marry if she is carrying his child  it was katherine s idea for the two to get married
