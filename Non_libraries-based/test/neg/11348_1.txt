i just finished watching one episode s  a boy in a bush  so maybe my review is not very fair   but based on that episode  this is a very poor version of csi  the acting is crap  the main character  dr whatever her name is  is so fake it actually hurts  i wouldn t cast her to do an add for dog food   the other hurtful thing is david boreanaz of the  angel  fame  a good actor  does a great job  but wasted coz of the idiotic acting of that woman   supporting cast is ok  but all is ruined due to this stupid acting of emily deschanel    very disappointing version of csi  very sorry to see it appear on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it   that woman is really sh t  at least in that episode  but based on this one view  i will not even invest watching it even if it was shown on an elevator screen
