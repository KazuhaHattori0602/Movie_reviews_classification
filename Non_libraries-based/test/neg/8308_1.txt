i watched death machines as part of bci eclipse  drive in cult classics  featuring crown international pictures releases  on dvd  as i work my way through the multiple dvd sets  i am growing to love many of crown international s movies   especially  the creepy  erotic  psychological thrillers    death machines is not one of them   after seeing movies like malibu beach  the creeping terror and the pink angels  it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made  but  it doesn t have much going for it   no plot  really no story to speak of   the acting isn t evident   only the actor responsible for the terribly played tony  with the thick  fake italian accent  made any attempt to  get into character    the score is annoying and pedantic   the only thing about this movie is why  what compelled the film makers to make this film    did they think the story of    three ninjas    two competing crime bosses    an ancillary bartender   karate school student character  and   his pitiful love interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made    this is a complete waste of time and money  for you  me  the producers  writers  actors  and the director
