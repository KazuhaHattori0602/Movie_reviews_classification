as i post this comment  imdb currently rates alfred hitchcock s subpar saboteur a   personally  i rated it less than half that  honestly  i can t tell how a movie this bad could ve come from what is probably the most consistently good director i know of  i ve seen about   other hitch movies from the  s s  vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while saboteur is easily the worst  it s hard to believe that   years earlier hitch used the very same formula in the   steps far more competently  my recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague  it s the only hitchcock movie that i turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest  if you must watch it  then rent or borrow  don t make the mistake i did and buy the dvd on good faith earned through notorious  rebecca  vertigo  rear window  etc  even a master screws up sometimes  i guess   edit  maybe i was a bit harder on this film than i should ve been  it s certainly nowhere near ed wood or manos or anything like that  but there s three reasons i feel i must rate it so low     the name  hitchcock  brings with it certain expectations of quality  this film delivers on a few of them  but they re way overshadowed by the darn near non sensical plotting     i want to compensate a bit for all the   ratings this film is getting  hitchcock is like the john coltrane of directors  true fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art  but the high rating on imdb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is      i spent   on this  maybe if it d cost me   or even   i d probably be a bit less bitter
