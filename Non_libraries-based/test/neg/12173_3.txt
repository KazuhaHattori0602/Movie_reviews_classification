  having garnered some particularly favourable comments from some of imdb s more respected horror officianados  i decided to see what the fuss was all about  i ve just finished watching the film  and i can honestly say that i haven t been this disappointed by a horror film for quite some time   with its dreary  muddled pseudo philosophical plot  and an extremely bland performance from leading man everett  dellamorte dellamore is an irritating and plodding mess that not even some splattery gore  courtesy of sergio stivaletti  and welcome gratuitous nudity  from busty anna fialchi  can save  i am at a loss to understand the amount of in depth analysis and discussion that this pretentious bilge has received from its misguided fans
