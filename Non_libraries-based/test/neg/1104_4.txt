j s  cardone directed a little known  video nasty  in   called  the slayer  and since then has gone on to have a hand in a handful of feature films  including the rubbish   vampire movie the forsaken  his latest feature film  wicked little things  boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster that i seem to remember surfacing a couple of years ago in relation to a film that tobe hooper was meant to direct  well i guess he felt that this one was too similar to his silly zombie fungus movie  mortuary  and so turned this one down  i don t blame him for it either  the plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters that move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband  however  what they don t realise is that around a hundred years earlier  a group of children that were being used as miners were trapped down a mineshaft  naturally  that s not the end of them and they managed to survive their ordeal and now prowl the area in search of revenge
   the film is essentially a collection of clich s  from the youngest kid with an  imaginary friend  the mother who dismisses it and all the usual zombie rubbish  j s  cardone attempts to get the horror fans back on side with shocks and gory scenes  mostly involving kids  but its not enough  the story doesn t play out very well at all either and really did remind me too much of the earlier mortuary  and that s not a good thing  although mortuary is actually a better film than this one  the acting is nothing to write home about either  lori heuring is decent looking  as is eldest daughter scout taylor compton  but neither manages to provide an interesting performance  chloe moretz is slightly better than the usual child actor  the plot is given hardly any credibility and indeed the screenplay can t even be bothered to explain the reasons why the kids attack the locals  it all boils down to a typical and rather dull ending and overall i have to say that if you know your horror movies  then you can feel free to skip this one
