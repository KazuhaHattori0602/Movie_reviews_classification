c tait compl tement minable     fuir absolument    this was an idiotic attempt to destroy classic source material  and thoroughly succeeded   do not see this film under any circumstances unless you wish to have your ten euros torn up and shoved up your nostrils by a bunch of vapid  atrociously unamusing characters   this type of film clearly illustrates the gulf that still unfortunately divides directors and audiences  if the individual  heaven forbid a collective could have conceived this dross  behind this had been considerate enough to watch the version currently playing in french cinemas  he or she would have endured what i was forced to endure  and mercifully rewritten it or just scrapped it altogether  the vein of adult humour being mined here dates  to my mind  back to fritz the cat but lacks that film s avant garde status or even its base attempt at social commentary   with the proliferation of remakes and increasing reliance on pre existing source material to fund storytelling these days  one would hope that choosing snow white  and thus not having to worry about conceiving characters or a radically new story  would have allowed more time for  oh i don t know  interesting animation  smarter jokes  perhaps a coherent film that has something to say and doesn t telegraph its vacuity from the opening frame    a manifestly appalling production
