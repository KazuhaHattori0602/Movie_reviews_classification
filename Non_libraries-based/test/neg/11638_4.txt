made with film stock left over from the production of nana   s sur un air de charleston is described as a holiday film for all concerned  and that s the best way to view it  jean renoir seems never to have thought enough of it to even edit the footage together  the plot is a simple reversion of racial stereotypes   in   a black explorer travels to a post holocaust paris where a white native girl teaches him the charleston  naturally he assumes she s a savage whose dancing is a prelude to her eating him before giving in to the seductive beat of  white aborigine  music  there are plenty of surreal touches  be it the pet gorilla eating the flowers in catherine hessling s hair  the angels the girl telephones  renoir and producer pierre braunberger among them  or the fact that black performer johnny huggins plays his part in minstrel blackface while hessling s dancing ability is almost completely nonexistent  and there are some interesting occasional experiments with slow motion  but there s not really enough to sustain it for two reels  an additional air of surrealism is provided by the fact that this silent musical has absolutely no score at all on lions gate s new dvd
