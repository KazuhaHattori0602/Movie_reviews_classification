what an absolute joke of a movie  the case for this film would have you believe it is duel meets jeepers creepers meets texas chainsaw massacre  three good films in their own right and you would think  using their blueprint  mm couldn t go far wrong  well that s what i thought  and i was very  very mistaken    we follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding  they pick up a girl  no she doesn t get her clothes off  then they get chased by a leatherface rip off in a monster truck  whom they aptly name f kface  aka monster man   the monster truck i will admit is a very cool vehicle  but the less than suspenseful chase scenes ruin it s potential   so mm decides he s got a bit of a grudge against these guys and chases them for a bit  they loose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees  then they go to a motel where lead character adam sleeps with hitch hiker sarah  though they both wear underwear  then they are caught by mm  taken to his home where they escape death and try to kill mm  but fail  hence the set up for the sequel  apart from a minor  twist  that s it   if you can get past the first   minutes   where adam s friend harley pops up from hiding in the back of adam s car to try to scare him  with no explanation as to how harley even got there  how long ago or how adam even failed to realise   without thinking you hate it already  then you may just enjoy this film   monster man has very poor cinematography and direction which is immediately off putting  this is the kind of movie that you ll be able to pick up as one of those films in a box set of   horror movies that you ve never heard of   what is so irritating is blockbuster stock so many of these poor quality films that are shot on digital by some amateur film students  and that s exactly what mm is  though imdb states this particular director was born in    the acting throughout this film is atrocious  the script  which the writer obviously considered to be funny  is irritating and childish  you get the impression only one draft was written before they started shooting  in fact  the script is do dire a lot of the film seems improvised  full of those boring  un entertaining conversations that are only funny or important to the actual people involved  imagine you filmed yourself and your buddies having a conversation  sure  points are funny   to you  but mostly it s trash  that s what the script for mm is like   don t watch it for the gore either   it s fairly minimal and there are much better gory films out there  bad taste  evil dead et al
    jeepers creepers       even with their cheesiness and plot holes  are far superior to this film  compare the intro of jeepers creepers to the intro of monster man and you ll see what i mean
