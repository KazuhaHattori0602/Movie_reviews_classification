the dune miniseries opens with a  flashforward  montage of action sequences  the realisation quickly dawns that these are the  best  scenes out of the   minute running time  and they re not good  not good at all  oh dear    but let us not judge a book by its cover  even though that s exactly what we re being invited to do  let s give dune a chance to redeem itself   well  here s the expected watery opening on caladan  but who s this petulant  strangely ugly man  paul atreides   this  is paul atreides  this generic plastic puppet  and why does he look so old  what s that  the actor s only   well  he doesn t  look  it  and that s way too old anyway   but at least he has charisma  right  wrong  alec newman is a stumbling  mumbling buffoon  i m picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over  and he s just too dumb to realise it  when your paul atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast  and an acting range from  petulant  to  blank  your production of dune is doomed from the start   the other actors take pity on poor alec though  and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn t look too bad by comparison  at least  i  assume  that is what they are doing  because i m charitable  you see   to be fair  they are clearly being given no direction at all  random gestures  blank or inconsistent deliveries  missing their marks  it s all here  this is like a master class in how not to do it   and sure  there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the   movie  but there aren t twice as many  because of all the  pauses  to fill  time   but we can forgive all this because of the small budget of   million  or only   million per hour  nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget   except perhaps  stargate sg  which makes do with   million per   minute episode  or  farscape  at   million  and frankly i d rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys  than have to sit though the travesty that is dune the miniseries again
