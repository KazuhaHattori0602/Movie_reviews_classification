i have barely managed to view the entire film  only after about  min out of the movie s  min did the journey to mars begin  and then there were  min left for the closure  these   long minutes were very boring and didn t contribute anything to the film  when finally reaching mars  it wasn t much better plot wise  it all could have been fitted into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missed   what i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new born babies were named  aelita  why would someone want to name his her baby after a villain  who despite having only one eyebrow  apparently has   breasts   the only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes  they are an interesting experiment in constructivism  just as  the cabinet of dr  caligari  was for expressionism  five years earlier   i give it   for the great looking design
