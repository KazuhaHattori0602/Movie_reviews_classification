i have read the other user comments and i am happy someone has compared it to the original by kamal called perumarzhakalam released in    the original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the indian govt not having proper records  or even bad shoots and bloopers   the story is great and a touchy one and well described by others  but sadly nagesh taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarism   i guess he has been affected by bollywood s so called  inspired  syndrome   he must at least give credit where it is due   i liked some of his older movies  but now i suspect if any of them were originals after all   here is a link in imdb for the original masterpiece    i recommend everyone to see the original  even with subtitles if needed  to know what class direction and class acting is all about
