the gates of hell opened up and spit out this film  then closed again   watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies i have seen  like all other movies  nothing makes sense in this movie   it would really take too long to mention all the plot problems  in fact  except as a warning  it really isn t worth wasting some of the nearly infinite space available on the internet writing about this film   from now on  i will check imdb before watching any film   hot darn  imdb is forcing me to write more about this film  i guess i should warn you about edison force while i am at it  but if you had to chose between the two  pick edison force
