i usually give sequels the benefit of the doubt and go easy on them  but this
is very poor  the exact same as what happened in the first film happens here again  the exact same  only they wanted younger kids to be able see it  this accounts for the repeated presence of bugs bunny but why they threw in one  f ck  is beyond me   they didn t even bother to change jackie mason s character from dangerfield s  let me explain  in caddyshack rodney dangerfield played a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club  in this movie jackie mason plays a boorish real estate owner who enrages the uptight members of bushwood country club  a big effort they made to change the content of the script huh  no  i don t think so  a very unfunny dan aykroyd shamefully copies bill murray s character  he even goes after the gopher  now more like a gremlin  in much the same fashion as murray did    there is not a laugh to be had  a sample of the  comedy  in this film  jackie mason is getting ready for a hot date with dyan cannon  he is in the bathroom is his robe  he moves to the door to get dressed in his bedroom when
the door handle breaks off  wow  that s the best they can do  eight years to think of a completely new sequel and that s all we get  i could have pulled a better script out of my ass   see it only if you re a die hard fan of the original  it s the only way you ll find any kind of laughs in it  everyone else steer clear
