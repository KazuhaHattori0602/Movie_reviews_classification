a space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space  the crew investigates  hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship  however  once aboard the ominous vessel  their own ship mysteriously disengages  leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then count dracula or orloff as this creature calls himself   not a bad start  i mean it follows any number of typical sci fi horror plots  the genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film  but  when you start with a fairly typical horror convention  the legend of dracula and vampires in general  and combine it with a fairly typical sci fi convention  a crew happening upon something and becoming marooned to battle whatever they re forced to confront  the filmmakers better have some clever up their sleeve to imprint their own mark on the familiar genre staples   director darrell roodt  who also wrote dracula   with ivan milborrow  is primarily responsible for this utter failure  so  no  roodt and milborrow have nothing up their sleeves but their arms   this film begins ominously enough  with a very poorly delivered voice over by caspar van dien  essentially providing enough exposition to explain who the crew on his ship are  i should also point out that van dien s character is named van helsing  and  oh so very cleverly  this orloff character is from planet transylvania in the carpathian system  no kidding  i mean  come on guys  we get it  and  again  don t be goofy and use such names unless you got something special in store   so  after van helsing s introduction of the crew  we have  essentially  a film about this crew trapped in a space ship with a vampire lurking about   i m a very forgiving viewer when it comes to low budget films  occasionally  they can be brilliant  see raimi s first two evil dead films  dracula   had a decent budget  enough for some decent special effects and for the salaries of  rd stringers like  van dien  erika eleniak  coolio  etc  however  unlike  the evil dead flicks  there is no talent behind the camera  in front of the camera  the talent is marginal  but i m going to give the actors some benefit of the doubt  it really seems like they don t know what to do  the best actor of the bunch  alexandra kamp groenveld  gets killed off quickly and the ever enjoyable udo kier is reduced to being an exposition vehicle for the viewer as the deceased captain we hear and see via a video journal  grant swandby is also okay as the professor  but it s hard to take seriously a scientist in the year   who wears glasses and rides a wheel chair  and  yes  it s a wheel chair as in there is nothing futuristic about it  as for the rest of the actors  well

 i m sure coolio really tried to be scary after getting turned into a vampire  but  well  i don t think irritating qualifies as scary in most people s book  tiny lister and erika eleniak don t really provide much either  lister is never really more then the il  big brawny black stereotype  eleniak actually appears unhappy throughout the film and never tries very hard  eleniak is a pretty girl  even in her mid thirties  but looks a little worn out and uninterested for the movie s duration   this brings us to count dracula orloff played by langley kirkwood  to be honest  i can t recall who exactly the vampire is supposed to be  he introduces himself as orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as count dracula as well  go figure  in any case  you will be absolutely astounded by just how lame this vampire is  have you ever scene those cheesy horror show hosts local networks would have on their creature feature time slots  yes  it s that bad  langley kirkwood  the actor playing orlock  must have found it almost impossible to concentrate in such a ridiculous outfit  i m sure he s still getting hassled by his friends   there isn t much to the plot  the vampire is the last of it s kind and wants to go to earth  for some reason  and also  there is some lip service about wanting to defeat caspar van dien s character  van helsing  most of the crew get turned into vampires  including van helsing  and the crew use conventional machine guns and pistols to try and defeat them before they figure out the old stake in the heart routine  yeah  that s right  bullets  and yes  the year   keeping in that baffling vein  one of the main areas the crew hole themselves up in while battling the vampires  or vampire  since there is really never more then one threatening them  is filled with old soviet posters and insignia and such  what the  there are also references to god religion being antiquated systems  but these references only confused me  did the soviet union make a comeback  is there some point roodt and milborrow want to make with this  it never really goes anywhere  seems dumb and the posters  etc  just look cheap   on the positive side  the film is competently shot and edited  the cinematography is nothing spectacular  but it s clearly done by professionals and  i had no problem with the special effects  the ships look like ships in outer space  although  as i write this  i recall how god awful the corpse of the captain looks when the crew discover him  what were they thinking  why didn t someone say something  see how difficult it is to say something positive about this film without falling back on the negatives  i guess  ultimately  that s the thing  whatever positives you try and grant this sci fi horror debacle  you become overwhelmed by it s lack of quality   poor udo kier
