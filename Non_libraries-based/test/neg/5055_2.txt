i heard this movie was bad
they even warned me it was terrible  but for some reason  probably katie holmes  i still watched it when it came on national tv  watching kevin williamson films means torturing  his scenarios aren t funny  definitely not scary and not the least bit creative  teaching mrs  tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series `dawson s creek  and it s probably meant for the same target group as well  before the credits even started    people already wanted a hug and they stated that eerie `i love you sentence  it doesn t get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop rock and the storyline is ultra thin  three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school  every high school has a teacher like that  you know
 to save their skin  they try to convince mrs  tingle that it wasn t their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong  the typical high school humor is completely lost on me  the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting  with the exception of helen mirren  is abominable  i m sure katie holmes can act   that s a fact proven by her role in `the gift    but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles  as said before  the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew  it s like kathleen turner in `serial mom  the role suits her perfectly and you can t imagine anyone else playing her  other than that  this is avoidable teenage nonsense
