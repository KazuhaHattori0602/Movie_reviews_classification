i hadn t planned on watching o  because i didn t like o  that much  i thought o  was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars  anyway i was talked into watching o  one night and i regretted it a lot  the plot is not only boring but also senseless  i honestly don t even know what it was all about  i left the movie after   quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn t like it  much more pleasure i can tell you that  but even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless  my advice  don t watch  go watch team america  hilarious btw  and forget about ocean s twelve   in my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years
