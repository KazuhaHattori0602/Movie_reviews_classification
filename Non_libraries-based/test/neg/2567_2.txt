dr steven segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak  this movie strikes me as foolish earnestness that has morphed into an unintended camp classic  the best kind  memorable lines include  knowledge is like a deer  chase it  and it will run away from you  and  drink this  it will make you feel better  it is so sublimely bad   they couldn t have made it any worse if they tried   segal tries to convince you that he is   sensitive   by saving a stricken pony    a good father   by a saccharine cooking scene for his daughter    a man of science   by looking at a fake spectrum    in tune with nature   by using homeopathic remedies    politically correct and multicultural   by having indian friends    an iconoclast   by opening a rural practice after a former life in a national research lab  and   an action hero   by being really fat but yet can still fight  rotfl   it s good to see on as a late night saturday flick  with friends  preferably  but not necessarily  inebriated
