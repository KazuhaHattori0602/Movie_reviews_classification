   second  none of the characters are likable  you really don t care what happened to them  third  the villain is very easy to identify  the grandson kills his father  sodomizes the friend s son  get the maid pregnant  smothers his grandfather  like jt says   if you like evil with no retribution  this is your movie  nothing more to say
