a really terrible movie  really low budget  with terrible acting  a convoluted and inane plot  a modest reworking of the vampire tales mixed with modern science   the result is a total mess  without meaning for most parts  with very limited and cheap effects  it is not even fun  like several of the low budget independent movies of this kind  a waste of time
