this has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the sci fi channel  here is how the movie starts  women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is a ok as long as it only targets soldiers  in case your wondering  men  however the virus back fires  big shock and all the men on earth slowly die  then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man  now we are taken around   to   years from now  two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says  hey  why don t we bring men back  the other one says no the world is not ready for that  but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the eath again   first off  this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters  secondly  the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that  this is the biggest waist of time you can find  this movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story  but with the lifetime style acting  avoid this movie at all costs   i give this a   out of   but only because i could go no lower
