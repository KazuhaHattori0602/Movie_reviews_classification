this movie was  unfortunately  terrible   clich d  hackneyed  stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable   the feel good finale is laughably lame   there is a reason judge reinhold s career has vanished   if you don t live in new york  and aren t jewish  several of the jokes will be inscrutable   i  too  found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting   i simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film fests   it is  without a doubt  one of the worst films i have seen in quite some time
