this movie was pure genius  john waters is brilliant  it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about   times since i bought it a few months ago  the acting is great  although ricki lake could have been better  and johnny depp is magnificent  he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor  and seeing most of johnny s movies  this is probably my favorite  i give it   rent it today
