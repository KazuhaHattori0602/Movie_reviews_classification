i thought this is an unbelievable boring movie  i heard the director can t speak french and so he left his actors tell what they wanted  well  valeria bruni tedeschi is great  as usual but i can t say the same of other actors  they have nothing to say  especially bruno todeschini   they all seem very tired  this being one of the movie plot   tired of being together  of living abroad  of their live in general  so they spend half the movie sleeping in a hotel room  after a while i felt sleepy myself   i gave   because of some very beautiful scenes  including the last one
