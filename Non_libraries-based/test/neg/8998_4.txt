this film is enjoyable if you like poverty row  public domain films from the first half of the  th century  or are a fan of amateur film making  the film splices together public domain thrillers together along with newly shot scenes in which the  actors   with the sole exception of redfield doing a near dead on lugosi rip  all of the  performers  are simply dreadful  attempt to interact with the stock footage  the  new  footage is covered with digitally added film scratches  as is some of the already substandard old footage   as near as i can figure out the plot has something to do with a bunch of strangers being brought together on an island for a will reading  this film  while boasting a creative premise ala  dead men don t wear plaid  is a technical and creative wreck  in one dreadfully over long sequence and injured sailor on a ship describes an abortive trip to  fog island  whatever that is  the  flashback  then incoherently weaves together old footage from totally different eras  and of totally disparate film quality  unrelated scenes from  the lost world    the most dangerous game   white zombie   bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla   and some other poverty row productions  this is done over an incredibly bad voice over which seems to have too much room echo as if the audio was recorded on a cheap home video camera   the  filmmakers  seem to think that they are paying homage to the great actors of yesteryear by giving characters the surnames of famous actors  carradine  zucco  ouspenskaya  etc etc  this tactic was done cleverly  as well as subtly in  final destination  here it s just obnoxious  bizarre  and painfully unfunny  jokes about spiderman  dracula  and superman abound  even the old as dirt  dewey  cheetam and howe  lawyer reference is used here this was old and tired when the three stooges used it in the  s   the film stock and audio  don t match scene to scene  and dozens of different sources are used for lugosi  the finale effect is that he seems to be getting  older  younger  older  thinner  heavier  younger and older again minute by minute  oddly the film didn t use this as a comedy subplot and squanders a good chance for comedy   truth be told though  it was great fun to watch this late at night in bed  maybe thats what they wanted to happen
