this film is right up there with the oscar and moment by moment as one of unintentionally funny films of all time   it is worth the rental for a some wildly great laugh s   the story is absolutely ludicrous nothing in life would happen like this it s so completely unbelievable  the way james woods tries and hustle heavy hitters  than they give this supposed two bit hustler a job   miles away in la what a joke  i love the old beat vw bug to signify how low they ve gotten in life because of all the `tootski s   sean young is as unbelievably bad as the   i ll love you forever  no matter what  wife  you ll ever see if it wasn t so funny you would throw up at how sugary sweet young tries to project herself and as bad acting as you ll ever see   james wood overacts throughout the whole movie and he s so extremely funny and is way  way over the top  it s just not to be believed  woods seems like a parody of a cocaine fiend off saturday night live but watching woods on `ludes  is worth the price of the rental   i love it when woods tells the guy who wants to give him some more `ludes  that he doesn t do that stuff anymore  right before that  woods just did three giant lines of coke   this is some very funny stuff   the ending is so comical but right on par with the rest of the movie
