norman wisdom s final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings   bringing his accident prone milquetoast up to date  this being a product of the swinging sixties  the end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star s typical slapstick  and sentimentality  with mild sexuality and even milder satire  the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager sally geeson  who doesn t mind getting involved with him but doesn t take their relationship all that seriously either  sarah atkinson appears as geeson s friend who warns norman of her fickle character   the film is nowhere near as bad as leonard maltin s bomb rating would have it and  if anything  is interesting for its treatment of mid life crisis  being in many ways similar to hoffman [ ] and   [ ]   both of which  incidentally  i ve only just watched  towards the end  norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking  the pretty things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and norm himself sings the catchy title track
