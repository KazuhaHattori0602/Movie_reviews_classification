alexandra ripley wrote a horrible sequel to margaret mitchell s masterpiece book published in the  s  margaret mitchell s heirs sold out their rights and for big bucks allowed alexandra ripley to write a piece of junk book even worse than barbara cortland romance novels  i was a huge fan of margaret mitchells book and the fake sequel by alexandra ripley was written just to cash in for money   although i always admired the acting talent of joanne kilmer and timothy dalton  this is a really terrible film  the script is horrible and full of clich s  ann margarets cameo as belle watling is so awful i wanted to slap her   the only worthwhile thing in the movie is sean bean who gives a masterful bravura performance as the sexy  feral villain   lord fenton  sean bean s performance is along the lines of  the man you love to hate  and portrays an unsafe sex symbol   but sean bean is only in the first half of the movie so you then have to be tormented with watching an incredibly long   hour movie with an insufferably boring script   don t waste your money on this film  unless you are a hard core sean bean fan and just watch it for his wonderful performance
