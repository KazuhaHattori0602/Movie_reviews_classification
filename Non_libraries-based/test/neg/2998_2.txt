first the easy part  this movie is pretentious crapola   it put me in mind of  magnolia  and then i thought  wow  somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than  magnolia   i know nothing about the polish brothers  but this film seems to have been made by someone who learned a lot in film school but knows nothing about storytelling  the trite plot elements and sledgehammer symbolism are bad enough  but the dialogue is just pathetic    detailed comments would just be a laundry list of failure  the parts that are supposed to be funny or satirical are not  the  elegaic  parts are nice coffee table pictures with mediocre music  the  emotional  parts are simplistic   the worst thing is that the movie shows no love at all for the characters  except for a little cornball dignity in the priest   i still can t believe the respect some people have given this picture
