this is a great movie for first time ninjas who are dating  if you re trying to impress some cute little ninjette i would highly recommend playing this masterpiece  its one of those special movies that allows you to miss large sections of it without interfering with the plot   also i was wondering  where does a teal ninja hide  are ninjas color coded like this  is this normal  if i were attacked by one of these yellow or orange ninjas i would die of laughter before succumbing to his sword   and i finished my black star ninja test the other day  it was multiple choice  it went pretty good  i found there were a lot of questions on how to  sneak  around and look evil  its all about the eyebrows and the attitude    basically  the movie could have been better if    there was no color coded ninjas  or the color coded ninjas could combine into a super ninja    joe died in the first two minutes and patricia had to avenge him   miscellaneous monkeys were scattered throughout the file   patricia didn t talk and patricia was replaced with another character   the french guy was also a black star ninja   chris tucker  whoopi golderg  and chris rock were added as  comic  relief   ninja strengths came from miticlorians
