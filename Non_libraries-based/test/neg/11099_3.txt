the movie is apparently based on a popular french horror novel  by arthur bern de  from   not that i had ever heard about it before but belph gor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini series  the first movie got released way back in   simultaneously with the novel  arthur bern de was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously  the character belph gor is one of his best known creations   once upon a time sophie marceau was a promising new european actress who would conquer hollywood  she has now however dropped back again to movies like this one  nothing wrong with playing in french quality movies  since it s the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules   problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects  to make the movie good and scary  well  horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though  with some exceptions here and there  it s not like the special effects are bad in this one  especially for an european movie it is simply good but it s just misplaced  since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect  it would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch  no doubt about that really    the movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch  also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach  at times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach  while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie  this is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn t work out on any level  you can say that the movie is even a bit boring  it all also definitely gets worse toward the ending  after a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead   the editing seems totally off  it uses too fast cuts  without much style  while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good  modern style  also the time line is just plain messed up at times  as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order   the musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn t even sounds to fit the movie  as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting  i can t believe composer bruno coulais is an oscar nominated composer  the musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects   the movie is filled with many characters  which you however just couldn t care less about  it also just seems very unlikely that a woman like sophie marceau would ever fall for a man such as fr d ric diefenthal  the movie also features julie christie  which is nice but just doesn t add much to the movie   a horrible watch
