after the success of star wars  there was a boost in interest in sci fi movies  this was one of those cheap attempts to cash in quickly   a group of survivors from a spaceship land on a planet inhabited by stop motion dinosaurs  where half of them are systematically killed off  the people not the dinosaurs  porn movie level acting  cheap special effects  even for the time  although it looks like a lot of effort was put into them   costumes were pure  s  as were the hairstyles  ahh  the  s  i expected a disco to break out at any minute   nothing to really recommend in this film
