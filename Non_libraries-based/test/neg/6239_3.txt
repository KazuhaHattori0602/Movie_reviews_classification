do not watch this movie  go see something else   i was very disappointed  i cannot rate this movie any better than   the acting was quite good and i really liked william dafoe as the villain  but i cannot see why this movie made it to the big screen  the story was old and has been shown in   other movies and   tv series movies  the main problem was basically  nothing is happening  take a kidnapping  let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money  make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to   minutes  you got your  clearing  movie  the only   reasons i did not rate this a   was a  dafoe and b  the  plan b ending  there are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie     of these kind end with ending a    end ending b and   ends with something unforeseeable  boring  boring  boring
