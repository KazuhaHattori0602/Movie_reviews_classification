if i wouldn t have had any expectations of this film  it might have received a   or   as it stands  i give it a   the acting is poor  the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking  and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the characters   i watched  adam   paul  immediately before watching this film  and i both laughed and cried on several occasions  this film did not strike even a similar chord  the directors of  human traffic  may have some off hand experience of ecstasy  but there is no demonstration of actual drug related semantic knowledge here  in fact  i find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically oriented   watch  requiem for a dream  if what you re looking for is an amazing  touching film about drugs
