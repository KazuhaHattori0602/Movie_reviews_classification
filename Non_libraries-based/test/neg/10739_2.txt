the only reason i gave this episode of  masters of horror  a   instead of a   is because the two lead actors are good  and it wasn t shot on vhs  the story  the dialog  and the plot are ridiculous    talking   driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war  give me a break  what next  zombies who come back to go skydiving  maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows    i never supported the iraq war  but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces  and  homecoming  was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war    with zombies being mass produced in today s market  this is the spam of zombie related entertainment  how  homecoming  made it onto  masters of horror  is beyond me
