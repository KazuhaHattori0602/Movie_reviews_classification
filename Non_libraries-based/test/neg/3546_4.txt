matthew aldrich  this is a name worthy of remembrance  this is the individual that took fingers to keyboard and came up with one of the worst scripts of all time  clich  predictable  an insult to the public s intelligence   is he the sole beneficiary of blame  of course not  renny harlin took this abysmal excuse for a script and made it into a movie  sam jackson and ed harris actually read it  or not  and chose to star in it  culpability abounds   this is the denise richards of film scripts  there aren t enough razzies in the universe to give proper recognition to how truly horrible this writing really is   in all fairness  samuel jackson s profession is incredibly novel and the manner in which it s presented is highly creative  but  at the end of the day  it s all just trimmings  pretty trimmings   package it any way you want  garbage writing is still garbage writing
