this plot had more holes in it than an oj simpson alibi    i noticed two star trek references in the movie and  yet   ironically we have a lead character played by andy garcia  who is the antithesis of the vulcan philosophy of   the  needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one    let s just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of san francisco at incredible risk  michael keaton s character is almost as  unrealistic as well  he neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when garcia foils his  attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once  the child s doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been  held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but  put her on a wide walkway   stories up and she loses it    andy garcia s child is something of an anathema in this  movie  he is the most sympathetic and real character  one of the movie s bright spots  he furthermore utters a line  that must have been the result of serendipity  regarding fighting cancer that parallels keaton s motivation to escape  all in all  the movie was not a  complete waste  see from dusk to dawn   texas blood money  for that  but disappointing considering the talent on hand
