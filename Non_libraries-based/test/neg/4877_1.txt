where do i start  lets list the good things about this movie first     mikael persbrandt is great as the gangster thomas  this is the only character you will actually care about  and he s a bad guy   allthogh never does anything bad  and is generally a pretty likable guy    kjell bergkvist is always great  he s a bit toned down here  but he is quite funny still   the movie looked pretty good by swedish standards  good use of depth of field and lights   now the bad  this is by far the worst script to make it into the big screen ever  the acting by everyone else was pretty bad and over the top  the direction was horrible  a totally meaningless story  totally unrealistic characters and events and   hours to long  during emotional scenes pretty much everyone in the theater laughed  people just started walking out during the course of the screening    there s no way to actually summarize the story into something coherent  so i wont even try  every clich  ever conceived is in there  and in all the wrong places  i m sorry to say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life    watch it for a good laugh  but try not to pay any money for it     r
