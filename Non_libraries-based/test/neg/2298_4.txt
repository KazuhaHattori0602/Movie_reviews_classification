you know  i really have a problem with movie lists  i was reading maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the   greatest b movies of all time  and knowing me  i of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them  this is why you see reviews of movies like gator bait and barb wire and coffy on my list  so i noticed h o t s  at the video store the other day and recognized it from maxim s list of the   greatest b movies  and i decided to rent it and check it out  my only consolation is that i rented it because i recognized it from a list of b movies  so i already knew it was going to suck    given the type of movie that it is  i can t say that h o t s  is a total failure  since it is nothing more than a late  s t a film  and it never pretends to by anything else  the only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of ex cons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the self named h o t s  move in to  because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie  despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well  this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary    the story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved f u  which exists as one of those universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one  this new sorority  help out the seals  h o t s  is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals  the seal subplot is another one that doesn t really belong in the movie  and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie    this is going to sound weird  but there was actually one scene that i was pretty impressed with in this movie  one shot that i was impressed with  i should say  about midway through the movie  one of the girls in pi  the rival sorority  is pouring alcohol into the punch  and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it  oddly enough  what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that charlie chaplin would do  which really brightened up the movie  obviously  nothing in this movie comes close to anything that chaplin ever did  but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a   to a    as a whole  however  the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be  a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes  i liked how the remove one piece of clothing for every score in the football game at the end was one of the girls  ideas  riiiiiiiiight
  and not much thought is put into much of anything else  there is  for example  a scene early in the film when a couple of the pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a h o t s  party  accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph  the girl taking the picture didn t realize that she photographed them at the time  although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film    i ve seen movies like this before  it s kind of like gator bait but without the violence and the rednecks and coffy wasn t far off  even barb wire is much the same  just with a bigger budget and more silicon  thankfully  maxim s   b movie list contains only a few more comedies  because while these cheesy teen t a films are entertaining every once in a while as bad movies with the occasional semi nude scene  after watching h o t s  i think i ve decided that i like the bad horror movies better than the bad comedies  i d rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretend to be scared than pretend to be funny
