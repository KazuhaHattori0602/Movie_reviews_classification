although not a big coen brothers fan  i am an admirer of their dark humor films like  fargo  and  miller s crossing  i have been much less impressed by their other comic mode  goofy camp  or is that camp goofy  unfortunately   o brother  where art thou  falls into the latter category and isn t even as good as  the big lebowski  or  the hudsucker proxy    o brother  is basically an episodic series of in jokes without much point  and not all that much humor or cleverness either  as most reviewers have noted  the film s plot is very loosely   and  as far as i could tell  quite arbitrarily   based on the odyssey  its main character  ulysses everett mcgill  george clooney  is an  adventurer  like his homeric namesake and has as his  real  goal the return home to prevent the marriage of his wife penny to a suitor  of course  we don t discover that this is what the clooney ulysses character really wants until long after we ve stopped caring  and what does homer have to do with  cool hand luke  chain gangs  ku klux klan meetings a la  indiana jones  cult gatherings  a disbarred lawyer s vocabulary  a talent for blue grass country music singing  an association with baby face nelson  a clark gable lookalike hairdo  and other random and sundry character traits and encounters  i leave that for others to discern   the allusion to preston sturges   sullivan s travels  in  o brother s  title is equally pointless  yes  viewers familiar with the sturges minor screwball comedy classic might find it mildly rewarding to recognize the title of the socially conscious depression movie sullivan abandons hollywood and comedy hoping to make  and they might even be mildly amused by a couple of shot scene riffs  e g  hopping freight cars  and the chain gang shuffle into view a movie  but so what  the coen brothers don t seem to have anything to add to the art for art s sake versus moral high seriousness critical debate about the function of art  they obviously fall into the former school  but that doesn t seem to motivate the reference in the slightest  is it an homage  if so  why make it  i like post modern pop culture reference and textual play as much as the next person  but it s a lot nicer when it amounts to something at least tonally  if not thematically  consistent   and not just an arbitrary concoction   this screenplay is simply a silly mess  the only consistent  and consistently pleasing  element is the folk country music soundtrack  it doesn t have much to do with homer or preston sturges  but  considering the rest of the film  that s probably a good thing  on the other hand  i d recommend using the price of admission on the soundtrack cd
