rented   bad movies to watch with my friends in my dorm room   leprechaun   jack frost and the prey   i picked up jack and lep   because they are well known bad movies i have never seen   i picked this movie out because it matched the  how to find a bad movie  guide on badmovies org  no real description  no pics of the movie on the back  and i had never heard of it  had to be a winner     spoilers  but this movie is so awful it doesn t matter  p   this is a true bad movie  lep   and jack frost are dumb on purpose  this is dumb despite the best efforts of the cast and crew   this  movie  starts out much like evil dead  even the actors look similar and have the same style of dress  unlike evil dead it never gains any speed at all  for a  slasher  movie it is pretty bland  in   minutes   people get killed  but these are spread apart so far it becomes quickly boring   the director threw in a lot of boring shots on animals hunting  obviously to go along with the whole  prey  theme but they do nothing to advance the story and are quite boring  the gore is horrible  all these extra shots were to make up for lack of a script and story   the last   minutes of the movie are shot mostly in slow motion  yet another way to add length to this  the  climax  is such a total joke  its hard to laugh at it is so bad  the back of the box says  the ending will shock and haunt you  yes it will  it will shock you that someone could put such a bad  plot twist  on film and  haunt  you because you won t believe you paid to watch this crap   also the tagline is  its not human  and it s got an axe  one person is killed with an axe in the whole movie and it is off screen   a true   out of   i love laughing at bad movies  but this one is so bad that it even lacks campy qualities  no bad movie night is compete without a true character building flick  p
