i just got back from  ags  after seeing it  i m convinced that no matter how much it s written how he extensively researched the film  stone never has watched an nfl game in his life  great cinematography   give me a break  the game montages were almost unviewable and   of the other shots in the film were close ups  was there anything in this movie that wasn t brought up in  north dallas forty     aging star player   check  young hot shot   check  painkillers   check  owner who doesn t  get it    check  crazy off field behavior   check  also  it s the playoffs in dallas  i e dec or jan  in an outdoor stadium  yet people sitting there in tank tops and shorts   and what was with those lights   were they playing in a japanese kabuki theater or a sports stadium    and the strategy shown in the game was laughable  it s fourth     inside the  sharks    dallas leads   kick the frigging field goal  not only would this had made sense football wise  but you d then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two point conversion  hell  tie the game w  the extra point and stone could have made it an even   hours with overtime   were the lame montages of  old time  football players supposed to be a tribute to the game   give me a break   and the script   ugh  more cliches than you can shake a stick at   oops  there s another one    slapshot  was better than this movie  by far      skips this at all costs
