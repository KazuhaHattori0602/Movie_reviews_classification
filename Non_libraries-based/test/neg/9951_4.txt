not to be confused with the   george zucco movie  the mad ghoul   the mad monster  is a film that zucco appeared in the year before  in this fairly paint by numbers affair  zucco perfects a way to turn his dim witted handyman  petro  into a wolf man hybrid by means of wolf s blood injections  and then wastes little time in sending the transformed doofus to slay the former colleagues who had scoffed at his experiments  it is a very simple plot  really  and an extremely low budget production  glenn strange  who plays the man wolf here  would soon achieve greater fame playing the franky monster in films such as  house of frankenstein    and  abbott and costello meet frankenstein    the makeup job on him here is pretty lame  and only succeeds in making him look like a hippy with bad teeth  like the one in  s  teenage monster  the sets in this film  in addition  are fairly nonexistent  and the denouement is abrupt and unconvincing  i have given the movie a very generous   stars  in part because i have an abiding love for  s horror films  but truth to tell  most objective viewers would probably deem it laughable crap  and i suppose it is  it s certainly no well crafted universal affair or val lewton masterpiece  that s for sure  still  zucco is always fun to watch  even in undemanding piffle such as this  if you can spare   minutes of your life  i suppose you could do worse than  the mad monster   not too much worse  of course  oh one other thing  this dvd is from alpha video  and you know what that means  fuzzy images  lousy sound  indeed  the worst sound of any alpha video dvd i ve encountered so far  and no extras  you ve been warned
