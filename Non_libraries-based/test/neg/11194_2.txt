 this review will have some very obvious spoilers  so beware   a friend brought this over  and we made it through   minutes of the movie before we decided that fast forward  x speed was the only way that this film should be watched  there were points when we were watching the movie at normal speed where i would leave  prepare part of lunch  and return  to find that literally nothing had happened    lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged  nothing happened the background  no important facial gestures were made  nothing but mind numbing awkward silence   this is not how to make a thoughtful film  especially when the movie s plot follows all the same basic hollywood movie tropes  if i told you that disney was making a film about   girls starting a band  and the singer was a french exchange student  what you would expect to be the  conflicts  that arise   the lead singer has to overcome stage fright  someone has an unspoken crush  the band is late for their performance  and a side character has to buy them time    spoiler alert   all of those things happen in this movie   at no point in this film do you have even the slightest fraction of concern that these girls won t be able to accomplish their goal    this ends the section of spoilers   i like japanese films  i ve spent a lot of time in japan  i work for a japanese company  heck  i even know all the bands referenced in the record collections and mds that they re going through  and i ve sung along to the title track with friends at karaoke   this is probably the worst film from japan i ve ever seen  do not be confused  though the characters will have points in the movie where they do typical japanese high school things  this is not a  typical day in the life of  movie  this is  a day in the life of   extremely random  heavily conflicted  awkward japanese students   there are noticeable problems with the dvd  as well  viz decided that a great extra would be a producer reading aloud the wikipedia entry about the blue hearts  what a value  in addition  they care so little about the subtitling that the band s name in the subtitles   paran maum  is different than it is in the chapter selection menu   paran marum  in the final auditorium scene  there is a very visible reflection ghosting effect on everything  but this seems to be the fault of the original film     do not view if you do not absolutely love awkward silences
