this is an utterly forgettable picture  a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for   he should have demanded a refund  or at least a discount   the plot is something like this  a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth  thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that he s  it   the devil is in the details when it s time to rate a movie  and on that count zarkorr  the invader fails miserably  the monster zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen  totaling maybe   minutes tops  with a generous estimate  the cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at  and only because she s wearing a  teeny bopper  stereotype outfit  complete with a teasingly short pleated skirt  the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say  whiskey tango foxtrot  over  in the next moment you are left to ponder whether you ve just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained   pints of blood out of you   admittedly though  this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture  as the cast of  protagonists  is being  interrogated  by the fuzz  one of them responds to the questions with the statement  what are you  some kind of a question asker  it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if you re sitting with a group of friends  who won t be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this  you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughter   while this is no manos or eegah  it s not even bad enough to be classically bad  this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog  unimaginative characters  and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom
