after watching the first movie in bci s new aztec mummy collection  it s difficult to believe how excited i was about the set and how upset i was when the release date was pushed back  i ve watched a lot of mexican horror in recent months  some great   the curse of the crying woman  some entertaining despite obvious flaws   night of the bloody apes  and some cheesy   pick any santo movie  one thing that all these movies have in common is that none can be called  dull  well  that s not the case with the aztec mummy  it s been awhile since i last watched something so sleep inducing  i wasn t hoping for or expecting a great movie  but at least entertain me  the aztec mummy takes every situation that could be interesting and sucks the life out of it through repeated scenes of people doing nothing and then extending those scenes for what fells like an eternity  i guess that s what happens when you make an   minute movie with only   minutes of material  padding extraordinaire  for example  for anyone who has seen the movie  what purpose does the bat have other than to bring a masked wrestler type to the screen and to extend the runtime by   or so pointless minutes    i can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more entertaining than this one
