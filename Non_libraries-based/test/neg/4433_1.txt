to call this film a disaster will be an understatement  i don t even know where to begin  i have questions though  and lots of them  i would like to know who conceived of this script  who gave them money to make this film  who was in charge of casting and costuming  they should all be sued  i saw this film in my local library s catalog and i thought  hey  great  i had just seen the two fog movies that hollywood had produced and then realised that bollywood had a version  unbeknowst to me  that it would turn out to be a total and utter crap fest    dhund   the fog  is a film about four friends  actually just one of them but you should know that there are four friends  one of them is a beauty queen  played by india s  st mrs  world  aditi govitrikar  and the director spares no expense at letting you know this  the script even claims that she  the character s name is simran  has aishwarya rai eyes  kareena kapoor lips and rani mukherjee hair  feel free to barf if you want to  at least at this point you haven t seen the film  unlike poor me     anyway  simran receives a death threat one day from one of the contestants  uncle  who tells her to drop out of the contest so that his niece would have a better chance of winning  but simran s boyfriend doesn t allow her to do this and thus she participates in the pageant and wins  this causes the crack cocaine sniffing uncle of her former college classmate tanya to come after her  but with the help of her cousin kajal  simran drowns the culprit and they enlist both their boyfriends in the task of getting rid of the body  it s tough but they eventually get around to doing it   in a scene that borrows from hollywood s film diabolique  the pool where the dead body is hidden is drained only to reveal that the body is missing and this begins a conundrum of whodunit and where is it  by the time the film is over  the film successful steals scenes from  i know what you did last summer  i still know  scream   scream   scream   murder she wrote episodes and not to mention  columbo and scooby doo  shameless  i tell ya   inconsistencies and problems within the film include but are not limited to      a scantily clad simran answers phone calls three times from her would be killer  the camera shows her drop the phone off the hook yet the phone is able to ring again each time and she picks it up to answer      tanya tries to kill herself because she doesn t win the beauty contest  wtf  even aishwarya rai who is ten time more beautiful did not attempt suicide when she didn t win miss india     in the pool scene  the kids who come to retrieve the ball that has fallen into the pool conveniently disappear as soon as the police arrive  and the ball disappears too      the clich  blue contacts lenses of the killer change from blue to brown in the drowning scene  yet when his corpse surfaces again  his eyes are blue      nobody who dies in the film is mourned  strange  especially for indian society     when vikram jumps into the dirty murky pool  an underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously the pool is transformed to olympic size and is clean and clear as day      sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo orgasm drenched song and dance number about coming of age  that would have been cool for some bachelor party  but they were celebrating simran s pageant win  hello      kunal  sameer  simran and kajal can neither dance nor lip synch properly  but don t blame them  just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers     nothing within the film was choreographed  it was like they just told the actors to show up and do whatever the want      the film played out like there was no script  either that or the director was high and drunk when filming this junk     when simran s picture was published without her consent in a magazine  she flew to the police headquarters to have the photographers arrested  yet she receives death threats and never bothers to alert the police   just to mention a few of course  this film was a painful experience for me and i advise everyone to skip it by all means necessary and possible  bollywood should be terribly ashamed of this kind of film making
