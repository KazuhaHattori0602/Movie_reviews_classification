this movie had such a good premise to start with  suspense  slashers  a secret society  and you really couldn t figure out who the bad guys were until the last quarter of the movie   but it contained so many dumb clich s from the worst of the old american slasher horror movies  now  i love slasher horror movies  but there are all the old clich s that have long disappeared from american cinema  for example  the old  i hear noises in the basement and i m home all alone and the basement light doesn t work  so i ll go down to investigate  clich   three examples of these clich s just really irked me to no end      when potente finds out that there may be a secret society at work at the medical school carving up live bodies  she proceeds to ask questions and tell everyone   very publicly  in essence  she is saying   i found you out  come kill me because i am telling everyone your secret  and then she wonders why she finds blood smeared all over her bed and is brought her roommate s severed finger in a towel     even after one guy she met two weeks ago ends up on the dissection table and she finds out about this secret society disemboweling live people  she goes to the lab where all the dead bodies are stored   more times by herself at night to investigate     her roommate gets killed  she gets chased by the killer  whom she knows  doesn t report him to the university or the police  then leaves the school to go home to visit her parents  then she returns to school  apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her will let bygones be bygones and not try to kill her  even though she knows his secret  she was  of course  wrong   for someone who was supposed to be so smart  she was studying to be a doctor in the best school in germany  she acted like the clich  bimbo in a horror movie   these things just made a potentially good movie very frustrating  and made me wish the ending would come even sooner  halfway through the movie  i stopped routing for her and wished that she would end up on the dissection table  too
