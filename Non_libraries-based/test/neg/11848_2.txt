oy vey  jurrasic park got corman ized  as usual the plot is wafer thin  from   foot tall dinosaurs that weigh   pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are  to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs  i ve seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes  and all that is in the first   minutes of this disaster of a film  all the male actors are imbeciles  thinking a grizzly might be loose in the desert  constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill  and the female actors all look like they just came from a modeling shoot for fredrick s of hollywood  the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins  from the movie of the same name  it looks like they had a hand puppet version and a plastic model for the  motion  shots  if you want a good movie to sit around and heckle mst k style  this is gold  if you want competent film making and good acting  don t watch a roger corman film  acting gets a   out   some of the players upon this stage did try  story gets a   out of   it reads like a drunken storytelling session gone bad  special effects gets a   out of   i ve seen worse  but not many
