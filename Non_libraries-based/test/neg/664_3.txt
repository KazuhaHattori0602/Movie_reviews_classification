another movie with a star of a wrestling  so far i have noticed wrestlers can t act on the movie screen  this movie is no exception   the action is dreadful  it makes you laugh at what they say  and they can t be serious  they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid  the acting is horrible  possibly from the bad director   the plot was stupid just some people get placed in a hotel because they re criminals  and they get randomly killed off  the movie is stupid all the way through  making it one of the worst i have ever seen   the only think and this is why i give it a   and not a   is because of the way jacob goodnight dies  the pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome   overall this is a really horrible movie  and you definitely shouldn t waste your time with it
