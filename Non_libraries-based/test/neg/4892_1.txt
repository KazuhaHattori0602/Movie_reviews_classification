i have to say this  this is the first movie i m reviewing on here i didn t finish watching  i mean  i couldn t continue  no matter how adamant i am for watching things until the bitter end   the ballad of the sad caf  proved no match to this viewer  vanessa redgrave stars as the strange woman in town who does things like walk through the river with a full set of clothes on  anyways  a long lost relative comes to visit  he s a midget and
 well  that s as far as i got  what the heck was the point of all of this  i didn t even bother to wait for michael carradine to come on  as i was already pummeled senseless by the combination of the slow script and having to deal with a midget in a dramatic role  i call this coffee table cinema  the type of cinema that appeals to just a scant few of you  but the others just stay away
