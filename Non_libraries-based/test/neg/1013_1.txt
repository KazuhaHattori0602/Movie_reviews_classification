naked deanna troi    richie s brother chuck  from  happy days  with a reverse mohawk   death wish   has all this and more  including one clever scene where chuck bronson s character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window   chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away   all i can say about death wish   is that it is one of most incomprehensible  serious  movies that i have ever seen loaded to the hilt with mayhem  and nearly zero police response  despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score   as i understand it  bronson disowned this film  but happily cashed the check from golan globus   if you enjoy quality movies  avoid this one  but if you re in for a cheap  jackass  kind of thrill  check it out
