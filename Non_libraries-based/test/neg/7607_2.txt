this is a student film and it s a piece of crap  i would use much stronger language to describe it but then the review wouldn t be posted and the world needs to know  beyond any possible reasonable doubt  this movie really sucks   there seems to be a different ruler used when measuring an already famous director s early work  like somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to comprehend since he finally got it right now today  i m not buying it  the early movie  bad taste  made by the lotr peter jackson s sucks and this  early work  from another famous director really sucks the same way too  these  early works  are representative of crappy everything  from budget to scripts to actors etc  it all is bottom of the bucket trash  don t be fooled by the big name   if you like watching a handful of male  s hippie burnouts pretend they could ever command a ship with the worst special effects you have ever seen  this is your movie   i can t f ing believe this thing won a golden scroll award for best special effects  that is a joke right  or a joke award   if you want to watch what this movie wishes it was rent a season or three of red dwarf you smeghead
