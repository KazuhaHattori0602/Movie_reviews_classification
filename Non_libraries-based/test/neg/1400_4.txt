stylized hollywood westerns  full of familiar conventions  seem to have eternal life and this is an avatar  everything in it seems to have been scraped out of the back of a drawer from   a larger budget applied  and this production its issue   gary cooper has played this sort of role dozens of times   the displaced southerner  fast on the draw and firm with honor  though kinda easy going whenever possible  he plays blayde hollister who travels to texas looking for the gang who destroyed his cotton plantation  he wears a buckskin fringed shirt and packs two ivory handled six shooters  he speaks with a countrified accent    a feller could get hurt doin  this   cf   sergeant york  the gang is led by sneering raymond massey  who buys and sells land  usually by underhanded means whenever possible  the gang includes steve cochran  who cannot play a westerner though he s very good at scum bags in general  the requisite woman is ruth roman  daughter of the mexican plantation owner  who looks and speaks about as mexican as a boston brown betty   i don t think i ll bother too much with the plot  no doubt someone has gone into it in some detail and it s not worth much more mention  as in any   western  it s labyrinthine  everyone except cooper and his friends are underhanded and there are multiple double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets   everything is retro  the plot  the dialog  the wardrobe  even the music  the score is by warner s stalwart max steiner  he s the guy that scored  king kong  that was   this movie was released in    cooper s name  by the way    blayde hollister    prompted me to look through the records of the raca   the real american cowboy associaton   to see if that name cropped up in their archives  which date from the beginning of time to february  th    when the last real cowboy passed away due to an unfortunate encounter with a deranged peccary  there has never been a real cowboy with the name blayde  hollister  yes  but not blayde  as a matter of fact  there is no record of any real cowboy named wade  luke  cole  or matt either  the most popular names for genuine cowboys  in descending order of frequency  were clarence  mortimer  noble  nebukadnezzar  plautus  pinchbeck  and hortense   if this movie had been released in   it would have been routine  in   it is a calamitous monument in the history of human recycling
