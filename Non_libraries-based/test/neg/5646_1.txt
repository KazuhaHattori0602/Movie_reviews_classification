ever notice how so many really bad films attract so many   votes  not much of a riddle how that happens  but this is not much of a film  there are two ways of looking at it being given away in the mail on sunday     it s free  so you can t complain about it to much    it s free  so it can t be much good   my vote is number   the free dvd in the sunday papers things is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away  they re ones that have been out for ages and have made most of the money they ll ever make  so it s a case of anything else is a bonus  it s the last stop for old films  not the first for new ones  so you can guess how bad this must be to skip tv and dvd rental   the plus points are that vinnie jones does try hard and derek jacobi is good as dickens  the minus points are a longer list  trying isn t the same as succeeding for poor vinnie and jacobi s other tramp character is talkative ham that s gone off  the story is very weak  the dickens story does not have anything to do with the film s murders and feels like another movie slapped onto the script to make people think it s a british dan brown without the religion  the supporting cast are either there for the money  vanessa redgrave must be really hard up  or because they are friends or girlfriends of the filmmakers  it is also very  very long for what it is   vinnie taking his priceless dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs  but that s it  not funny and very not good even for free
