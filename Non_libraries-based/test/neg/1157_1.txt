  though i could be wrong  but i have yet to find it here  the original doesn t stray from the actual events and doesn t try to twist the story  i can understand telling the story from a different perspective  but this movie just tried to straight change the true story itself  something that i find as horrible as if someone made a movie based on   but gave it a twist that canada was behind it  or a wwii movie saying hitler was a good guy and helped fight the nazi s
