eastenders has gone full circle from unmissable in   to totally abysmal now  it s such a bad reflection of the nation this crap tops the ratings   the ideas for plots can consist of nothing more trivial than putting ever characters name in a hat  the first two out  regardless of their sex  will sleep with each other  the  rd    th out will have a fight in the vic  the  th one will be arrested  the  th develop an addiction   th get pregnant etc etc   the producers are clever though  the   minute show is only actually ever comprised of   lines     someone will walk in the vic   say  what s goin on    someone else will stand up say  leave it aht   out    then a woman will say  doan choo come in ere  n  insult mah fam ly   that s it  that s every show  apart from the occasional  get it sort id   is it sort id   the show was once a realistic portrayal of east end folk   their way of life  the buffers came off when   they extended it from two nights a week     the slater family turned up  how they attract viewers is beyond me  the kat character symbolizes everything that s gone wrong with society  treating anyone else like something she s pulled off the bottom of her shoe   the people who vote her the best character  in these polls  must the same as the ones that vote jamie redknapp  best sportsman  despite the fact he hasn t played a game for   years   what i can never understand is if the show is the pinnacle of british tv why do all the biggest names leave  ross kemp  martin kemp  the list is endless   how long has the longest couple s marriage lasted  with them being faithful to each other  yes  people leave  but until the script writers realise that characters  couple can be interesting   likeable without sleeping around the show will continue to deteriorate  an episode last week had   separate plots of exactly that  and zoe   the doctor top even lofty    shell  as  most unconvincing couple ever to appear on tv   yes  eastenders is the most watched show  thats undisputed  but many external factors contribute to that        is the perfect time of day to gain the most audience figures  it has an omnibus edition for   hours  and more than that  millions of the viewers watch it  out of nothing more than habit  but if they were completely honest to themselves  they would admit that  in   more than ever  it can be absolutely pitiful
