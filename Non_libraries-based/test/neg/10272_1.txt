put simply  this mini series was terrible  let me count the ways    absurd plotting    over acting    scattershot approach to characters    annoying narration    inability to create viewer interest   this film can t even pass the  soap opera for dummies  test  i m sorry i have not read this award winning novel  so i am judging it only as a film  but it really stinks  imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of appetizers  you look at the wide variety and want to taste them  but suddenly they are withdrawn  and you wonder where they went  that s like this film  with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out  there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a   episode series  yet we are given less than four hours to digest it all   there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you ll find on   monkeys  the pace is extraordinarily slow    dennis farina and helen hunt are so far over the top that their characters are not believable  joanne woodward s character is one dimensional    the persistent river metaphor becomes trite   and  probably the most absurd part of the film the cat  this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers well  come on now it s not even good stephen king   probably the most interesting character in the film  and one who is not drawn well  is john voss  the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film   just about everyone in this film is unbelievable   to sum up  there s little here to inspire  the drama is poor melodrama  it s just a terrible effort
