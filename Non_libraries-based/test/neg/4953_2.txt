jack brooks  quirks are  at first  somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie   i found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end  in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super tedious wait   the climax can t begin to make up for all the setup time   normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre  but the fact that the wait time before action index is so high  should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development   not so   while not without its initial charms  this movie ultimately infuriates  and disappoints   wish i could get all that setup time back  to reinvest it into something that pays off
