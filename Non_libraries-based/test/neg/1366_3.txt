this is one of those religious horror films which never explain why the forces of  evil  are   times stronger than those of  good  we ve got here a satanic cult which can     beam away  people  like in  star trek    kill through little children s dolls    transfer a soul from one body into another    hypnotize telepathically from a bigger distance  and   cause drastic car crashes in which selected persons turn into spaghetti while others  kids  in this case  survive unscathed   on the other hand  the forces of  good  can    sit around helplessly    stand around cluelessly    panic    laugh hysterically    waste time by doing nothing    read comics while people get slaughtered by the dozens  and   arrive too late to satanic rituals   in every religious horror movie i have to assume that that movie s world is inhabited by god and by satan  i also have to assume that satan can t be   times more powerful  unless the movie has a world order resembling that of hell  in other words  where were the priests in this film who knew something  the best that this movie s priest could do is guess that there are some witches about   nothing else   from reading all those books in his study  at the first sight of violence this priest becomes catatonic  then laughs hysterically  only to finish in a major panic attack  so this is supposed to be god s contribution to fighting satan  ridiculous  every good religious horror film has the powers of  good  equipped with some form of  more or less  supernatural power  or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight  evil  in that sense this movie is quite idiotic  as is the casting of the droll martin to play the high priest  of the cult  there is very little menace or awe in watching the quirky martin lead a satanic ritual  i mean  it didn t have to be christopher lee or langhella  but couldn t they have found someone less funny looking  also  why does the couple go back to the town after their car is put out of the running  after their  friendly  encounter with the town s folk no sane person would have gone back  they should ve just walked on  the man s explanation to his girlfriend  and the viewer  is that  who knows what s in that direction
