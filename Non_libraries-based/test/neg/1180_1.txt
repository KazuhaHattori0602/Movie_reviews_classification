what a waste of time to watch this movie  poor picture quality  poor sound  poor acting and definitely not based on actual facts  the deputy s  girlfriend  did so much overacting  as did the sheriff  that it was more comedy than horror  the deputy tries to make an emergency phone call by dialing  problem in   that emergency number was not in existence  that is just one example of glaring inconsistencies   the  scary  aspect was way underdone  just did not come across as horrific   i did think that the actor playing gein did the most admirable acting job in the whole movie  i could well see mental disturbances in his character portrayal   sorry this one just does not get it
