about the movie itself  there are ample comments    i just wanted to say something about the german version  which i have seen recently on tv  it is heavily cut  from   to   minutes  it is usual that the most bloody scenes are cut for german tv  i understand the reasons for that  but this movie was something else  they did not only cut  gore shots    they have cut entire sequences  sparing only glimpses  like   we have to attack them    one   second shot of explosions in the camp   protagonist running away   when the assault on the island begins  it isn t even possible anymore to follow the storyline  all the cuts create something that amounts to a string of erratic  disconnected scenes that don t make any sense anymore   i could not stand to watch the end after spending   minutes on this nonsense   i think i would have given the original   the german version is worth only    get it on dvd  and check the runtime first  or forget about it
