there wasn t a   in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figure   it is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting  and an awful script   this movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch  salman khan with his usual take off you shirt theme and govinda with his in humorous laughs  if somebody had told   decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman  after his success with maine pyar kiya  i would have written him her off
