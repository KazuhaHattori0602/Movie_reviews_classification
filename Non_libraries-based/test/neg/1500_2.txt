this one features an interesting way of handling a camera   espercially for a dtv movie   the version i saw was full screen    but it falls short on the scenario department  first you get  around  mn of talk  talk  talk in a would be hip  post trainspotting  way  then it s slasher city  and then comes  the most dishonest cheat ending i ve seen  much worse than   april fool s day    where at least it made sense  so  all in  all  it s the old song and dance   interesting director tries  hard  but deserves better movie  funny   usually  it is the actors which are in desperate need of  something better
 skip it anyway  for your time
