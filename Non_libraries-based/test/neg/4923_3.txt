the fact that a film is on dvd doesn t guarantee that its quality is very good  the fact that a film s quality is threadbare doesn t mean you shouldn t buy it  this review actually applies to   films paired on a single dvd   the plots of these films are of little consequence  they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films 
 anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett 
 or  in a pinch  basil rathbone  there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a one shot basis   such as  seven per cent solution  or  private life of sherlock holmes  in any event  these films are considerably less estimable   here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes  even if the results tend toward disappointing  this appears to be the only disc with these films on it  although  deadly necklace  appears by itself in the same version on other discs    sherlock holmes and  the deadly necklace  dates from   although it neither looks it nor sounds it  some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios  not that hammer hasn t turned out some really schlock stuff  but where christopher lee was concerned  they usually did a better job  the print a direct transfer from a rather worn   copy in black and white  the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color  and the snipped ends of the film s aspect suggest it may originally have been   or more   the film is set in the early  th century   not improbable  since holmes was still working then  and didn t actually die until   however  the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story  it involves an egyptian necklace  and professor moriarty shows up as a world famous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime  the plot is melodramatic and banal   the biggest defect of this film is that   for whatever unfathomable reason   hammer filmed it in germany  it was nonetheless filmed in english  it was then dubbed in german and then re dubbed in english  so what you hear isn t lee nor any of the other original actors  but a bunch of unknowns   not that  outside of lee  i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors  this is too bad  since lee  see his  hound of the baskervilles  makes a quite decent holmes  as it is  his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamon   the music for this film is primarily jazzy  in a possible attempt to be  period  too bad nobody thought of ragtime  as it is  the music doesn t relate to what s happening on the screen  and often is at odds with the action   the other film is  sherlock holmes and  the speckled band  from   starring a young raymond massey  the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the   effort  and in fact a bit better  massey makes a quite respectable holmes  although he certainly doesn t own the r le in the way rathbone did and brett does  the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers  the acting   as is true of many films of this period   owes a lot to the post victorian stage and to silent films   it should be noted that  while  the deadly necklace  is available on dvd by itself   the speckled band  is available only with the former film   there is very little else to be said of this film  the settings seem to be an odd combination of the  s  horse drawn carriages  and the  s  electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone  taken altogether  it s an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with  deadly necklace  only
