jack frost   the worst  horror film  i have ever seen  why   the premise is well beyond ridiculous   the damn thing doesn t even have legs to move on    it escapes after being completely submerged in anti freeze  first film    get this it travels all the way across an ocean of salt water to a tropical island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film     killer snowballs  i have yet to be drunk enough to see  ginger dead man  so as of the writing of this  jack frost   hold the distinction of being the stupidest  horror  film ever  even surpassing the inaneness of it s predecessor  if you can believe that
