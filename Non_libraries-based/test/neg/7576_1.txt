one of my co workers recommended this one  implying that it was one of the most frightening movies she ever watched  i checked it out together with my girlfriend and we gave up after   minutes or so   yesterday  i had a long talk with my co worker  we re still friends   this movie is as original as the latest film starring steven seagal  it brings absolutely nothing original to the table  the spooky parts have been done thousand of times before   the biggest fault however is the painfully slow pace of this movie  the periods between the scares are completely wasted with meaningless dialog and a lot of  nothing     of   molotov cocktails
