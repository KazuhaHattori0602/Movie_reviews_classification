i appear to be in the minority  but i thought  radio  was pretty awful  it seemed to contain almost every cliche in these types of  heartwarming  movies   the motivation for the characters falling in love with radio was never really explained  we were just supposed to accept that everyone was fond of radio except for a couple of bad apples   you could see almost all of th big moments in the story from   yards away  when the movie wanted you to go  a   or pull out your tissue  i was rolling my eyes and wished i was watching  rudy  instead   there were some good performances by the cast  too bad they weren t given a better movie in wish to appear
