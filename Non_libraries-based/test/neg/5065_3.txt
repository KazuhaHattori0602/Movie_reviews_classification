controversial german journalist jutta rabe who herself got divers to the estonia wreck  put this silly  thriller  together to save her investment   donald sutherland is of course always watchable   but he s only in three scenes  he delivers his material perfectly   as you can ask from a professional  also  the main lead  j rgen prochnov  is at times very good   the rest of the cast is  however  bad  the actress that plays the swedish minister secretary  or whatever she was   she seems not listed in the cast  is extremely bad   the script has some nice ideas  and the story is actually kind of interesting  the final screenplay should have been re written a couple of more times though  some scenes are plain ridiculous   especially the end scenes   the film is almost   hours  which is about   minutes too long  presented as a   minutes tv film  this could have been really interesting  as a two hour feature  it s pretentious  boring  stupid and plain out silly   jutta rabe might be a good journalist  her ideas about governments using estonia to transport military items from estonia to sweden have been concluded as true recently  when the swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship estonia for this  but as a film producer she sucks   the director  the writer and the actors suck more   i give this film   i would ve given it a   if it wasn t for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times  donald sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage   but we don t even see the boat sink  what kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that  like a werewolf movie without werewolves
