how does david lynch do it  unlike the legions of thick black framed glasses wearing types and pretentious movie critics who praise his name  i just don t see how this guy keeps getting paid to make such tripe  how can lynch sloppily cobble together leftover footage from a failed tv pilot into a nonsensical  poorly acted mess   have critics rave about it   actually include it on year s best lists   i m baffled  if you re looking for a good film noir  rent  bound  instead  if you re looking for a good  puzzle  movie try  memento  but beware of this over hyped stinker unless your idea of a fun night is throwing away     hours of your life     of your hard earned cash
