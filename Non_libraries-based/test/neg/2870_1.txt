i kind of like bam margera  so i was curious    but watching a home production with somebody elses friends and family  with a decent camera and a sound guy  just isn t good film making    writing  direction  acting and editing is abysmal at best  but i sat through half of it  and why   this film gives perfect examples of what not to do  it is a film student s dream of what to avoid at every stage of the process  cram it into film school curiculums all over the joint   so thanx bam  now i know jackass is for real   cause you ain t looking to win an oscar  dude
