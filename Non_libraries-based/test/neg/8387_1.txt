i had the misfortune to see this film recently and have to sit through it  a friend purchased it for   and insisted we watch it as it sounded good from the story on the back cover     minutes into the film it was apparent that the actors were amateurs and this was an extremely low budget effort   the scenes were very poorly acted  the script was stupid and the story contained many scenes which seemed unnecessarily long  just so the movie would be of a reasonable length   for instance when the lead character rents a warehouse  the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on this scene  with meaningless dialogue which serves no real purpose or necessity to the plot   the lead actor is supposedly carrying out revenge on a woman who sleeps with guys to give them hiv  he never once thinks to get tested  instead he turns into a crazed killer deciding to torture her before killing her and sawing her into pieces   if this sounds good and you are thinking this will have lots of gore  think again  this film has no real gory sequences and is quite tame for this type of film   it does not scare  it does not make you think  it does not offer fast paced fun  it may however put you to sleep  it is certain to bore you to tears  so please save yourself the despair and follow my heading   avoid this film   out of    this does not deserve even    the film was   minutes but seemed as if it was     hours
