my mate and i chose to watch this obvious piece of junk purely based on its tagline
 after nearly   years of lousy and rudimentary teen slashers  i can t believe that only just now some nerdy horror brainiac come up with the brilliantly witty slogan  they axed for it  other than that   miner s massacre  is just as random  annoying and forgettable as all the rest out there
  perhaps even more  the script contains all the typical clich s and features all the dreadfully stereotypic characters you wish a horrible and painful death to  the gore effects are computer engineered and thus beyond pitiable and the obligatory  big  stars  karen black  john philip law and richard lynch  are entirely wasted in spite of their top billing  cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns form an ideal horror setting   the creators of  my bloody valentine  already figured that out in the early  s   but his dull film simply hasn t got any innovative ideas or even remotely surprising elements to offer  bunch of greedy twenty something losers  which refer to themselves as friends even though they clearly can t stand each other  desecrate an ancient mine in search of the gold that is allegedly hidden there  of course they unwarily resurrect the zombie miner this way and he just   years of rest in order to prepare for a massive teen massacre  yay  the cast is exceptionally irritating in this one  the girls all have impressive racks but refuse to show anything  instead  they all prefer endless whining and the taking of needless risks  the dim witted blokes clearly just serve as screen fillers  in her barely five minutes of playtime  karen black still manages to make an utter fool out of herself by depicting the most prototypic and hysterical local nut woman ever  the zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face  but he looks okay and reasonably menacing when shown in the distant shadow of the moonlight whilst swinging around his pick axe  since the best thing about  miner s massacre  concerns the aforementioned tagline and you can read that on the box in the video store itself  there s very little else to recommend here  director john carl buechler scored a few modest hits during the eighties  like notably the original  troll  and a fair  friday the  th  sequel  but it s obviously time to retire now
