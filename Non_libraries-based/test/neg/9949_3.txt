as i sit and think about poison for the fairies  i realize that i may not being fair with the film  my rating of   may have more to do with my disappointment with the film than its actual quality or entertainment value  based on the plot description  reviews on imdb  and the   imdb rating  i would sure that i had stumbled on a little known gem  sadly  it just didn t do much for me  for whatever reason  poison for the fairies all but put me to sleep   poison for the fairies is the story of two young girls in   mexico city  one of the girls  veronica  is a compulsive liar and tells her friend that she  veronica  is a witch  the other girl  flavia  is so gullible that she believes and is frightened by everything her friend tells her  that s really about it  in reality  nothing much happens and the film drags on and on as veronica attempts to terrorize and dominate flavia  one commenter on imdb described it as  the scariest film in  s mexican cinema  my comment   if that s the case  there must not have been many horror films made in mexico in the  s  another commenter wrote   watch it if you wanna get scared  my comment   are you sure we re talking about the same movie  my opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples i ve given  to me  it was dull  uninspired  and poorly acted  the scene framing is especially annoying as director carlos enrique taboada doesn t ever show the faces of any of the other characters  veronica and flavia carry on long  drawn out conversations with members of their families and their teacher  but we never actually see these peoples  faces  it s an annoying gimmick
