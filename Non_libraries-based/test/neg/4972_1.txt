i love the jurassic park movies  they are three of my all time favorite movies   and i hate this game  if there was one game i wish i never own for the super nintendo was this one   how can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful  and to make it worst  i was scare of this game when i was a kid   how dumb was that but then again i was a kid when this game was first out   the game play in this game is just odd  one minute it s a action game and then it s a shooter  what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game   the sound in the game is just terrible to listen   the music is just too sick to listen to   the controllers in the game don t work most of the time   jurassic park the game is just a waste of time and money and won t be a classic   avoid at all cost
