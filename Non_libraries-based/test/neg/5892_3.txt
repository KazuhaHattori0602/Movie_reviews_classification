this movie was very disappointing in that several elements of the book were wrongly done  the main story is the same but there are several flaws that hurt the movie     boobie miles gets injured in the beginning of the story in a preseason game at texas tech  this means he won t get anything done during the season at all and chris comer comes up sooner on the team     the game against marshall was lost at marshall  the team depicted as marshall was actually midland high one of permian s main rivals and here is the proof  marshall high is the mavericks colored scarlet and silver  midland high is the bulldogs colored purple and gold  look at the jerseys and you will see who it is  also the real marshall high s football roster is overwhelmingly black  the team shown was racially mixed like midland high      permian only loses to midland lee by one point in district play  midland lee loses to midland high and midland high loses to permian  these are the teams that set up the coin toss as such     boobie comes back on the team as a reserve to chris comer and after not getting any playing time in the midland lee game  he quits the team completely at half time and never stands on the sideline or goes to any games again      brian chavez was a tight end and defensive end who wore   not a tight end and strong safety  in addition  boobie wore   and ivory christian wore       the coaches end up liking chris comer as a player more than boobie because he has a better lifting ethic and runs more straight up plays the way the staff prefers him too  this is in part why boobie quits the team      dallas carter is played in austin at darrell k  royal memorial stadium where ut plays in the state semi finals not the state finals  carter wins the state title but is forced to forfeit due to an ineligible player   the acting is done pretty well but if you read the book  you will see these flaws are pretty true  i am also tired of hearing all the pc hypocrites out there complain about the depiction of dallas carter s football team  the team according to the book is as large  monstrous  talented  and black as the movie shows  people say it is a racist depiction but reading the book  you see a true depiction of the team  the story is very altered giving this movie a score of
