cultural vandalism is the new hallmark production of gulliver s travels an act of cultural vandalism  not literally  after all  not a single copy of the book is burned  but if this is the only gulliver people are exposed to and to many it will be those people will not get anything like what jonathan swift intended  were jonathan swift alive  hallmark could be sued for moral rights violations and they d lose  that s a good way to think before starting a project using someone else s ideas   swift s masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity  through his hero  gulliver  he travels to places that make him feel big  small  shat on and
 human  the little people in lilleput are small in every way  petty and stupid  they fight  the big enders and little  enders  interminable wars of annihilation over which end of their soft boiled eggs are opened at the breakfast table  sounds a bit like us   i forget most of the rest  it s been years since i read it  the tv show reminded me of a few things and  on the bright side  it made me want to read it again   this gift to mankind has been shat on  like gulligan under the boughs beneath the vulgar yahoos  and danson  steenbergen and especially two great actors  peter o toole and edward fox  ought to be thoroughly ashamed  some  creative person  got the bright idea to put the focus on  the star  gulliver  played by ted danson  whose acting is just plain bad  he portrays gulliver as insane  all his travels were made up  weeeeel  yeeeaaah  of course swift made up gulliver  naturally  the lands he visited were imaginary  that s called fiction  his purpose was to talk about humankind and our  often awful  relations with each other  the travels of his imaginary character to imaginary lands is his method  but these people treat imagination as a disease and anyone who has a moment that hallmark couldn t turn into one of its anodyne cards is suspect   i can sure see why hallmark would produce this crap  it s so bad that o toole  always profound  seems as little as his lilliputian character  he s in character  of course  while commenting on the character simultaneously  as many  if not all great actors do  informing the character sheds light on it  our light completes the character  it becomes three dimensional through this act of psychic triangulation  most actors do this very subtly  like hopkins in  the remains of the day  others  like nicholson  in most things in the last twenty years  play the two parts pretty broadly apart  nicholson actually plays on the relationship of his two points and with us too  with him it s all cat s cradle and he  chuckling away  holds all the strings  great fun  as is o toole  but something here is lacking  he is shouting into a megaphone  as great as ever  and all one senses is a hollow shell standing under him   that s because it is  look up  anodyne  and there ought to be the word  hallmark  as a synonym  harmless  bland  inoffensive  hallmark is the doll who can t pee because she has no genitals  it is the norm  the average  the person of no distinction  hallmark s hallmark is to have no hallmark  i never suspected that such people despise those who have imagination quite so much  suddenly  pound s  disney against the meta physicals  stands out in bold type  or einstein s  men of genius always will be violently opposed by mediocre minds  indeed  anyone  to this mediocre type  who has an answer to any question other than  a  or  b  is suspect  who more distinctive then that a man who journeys to the darker places of the human soul and shines his little flashlight to illuminate what can be found there  hence the act of vandalism  the taliban destroyed the buddhas in afghanistan  the palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world at jericho  the barbarians the great statuary of the classical age and these things are obviously vandalism  hallmark endeavors to protect us from foreign foes by undermining our own culture  the one that feeds and sustains them  and us   please buy a copy of gulliver s travels wherever you live  and read it  or order it online  i like to use abe books
