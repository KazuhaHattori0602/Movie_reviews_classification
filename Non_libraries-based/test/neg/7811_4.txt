it was dumb  sort of like an adam sandler movie    there were a few funny parts but not that funny   i liked some of the actors in it though    there were some sat  night live people in the movie  but i wouldn t recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on  and it was still better than any jennifer lopez movie
