 the beginning might be a spoiler    the eye   is the sequel to  the eye  it s about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her   the sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that s the only scary thing  some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled     the eye  has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas  the eye   is a forgettable horror cum drama film  omit watching this  watching  the eye  is good enough
