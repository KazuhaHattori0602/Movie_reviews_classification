the movie is simply horrible   although actors are trying their best  well sometimes that isn t much  special effects are  let me put it this way it would be better if there weren t any   the script is based on sapkowski s prose  so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie  sadly it s the opposite  there is nothing left of the original atmosphere  and it s all very chaotic  maybe they just had too much material to show in  h time   anyway if you would like to see this film i would recommend you to look for the tv series  same title  same actors  even the plot stays the same  that was made in the same time the movie did  it is so much better   and the story there actually make sense
