this year s eurovision was to me a big disappointment  i ve watched the eurovision song contest every year since    well  at least that s the earliest one i can remember  and i was only   at the time  as any other year this one contained both good  bad and horrible songs   nothing new there  however this year s show was the worst one i can remember  only very few good  decent s probably more like it  songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs   turkey s winner song  every way that i can  sounded to me like a rip off of turkish singer tarkan s hit  simarik  just sounding a lot worse  it didn t deserve to win from my point of view  belgium s song  sanomi  coming in second  was a no language song  wonder what s next  animals singing  nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy  giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling  to which the  lyrics  seemed appropriate  one of the better songs  but that s not saying much   after one of the closest races in eurovision history russian duo t a t u  ended in third place just three points behind turkey and behind belgium  with  ne ver  ne boisia   don t trust  don t be afraid  to me t a t u  was one of the very few highlights of the show  surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants  they let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus  they let the song speak very well indeed   the biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was austria  the bookmakers here in denmark had the biggest odds on that song   a song that indeed was beyond horrible   but ended up in  th place  could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song  that performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most  not because it looked good  but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun   sweden did what they do the best  abba  in   they won with  take me to your heaven  by sounding like abba  in   they made the top   with  listen to your heartbeat  again sounding like abba  and once again this year they did it abba style  again ending in the top    england was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible  non catching songs  that they ve been the past years   ireland ripped off the winner from    fly on the wings of love  and i could go on and on about how bad the songs were   i feel a bit sorry for the aussies  who this year finally got the chance to see the eurovision song contest  they deserved better than this   i wasn t surprised by the show though  the eurovision from   to me stands out as one of the best in recent years    was quite good  but not as good    was okay  but certainly no more  this year was quite simply disappointing   let s hope it ll get better next year  if not for us  then at least for the aussies     one for t a t u  one for the close race  one for the butt shaking and one for all the rest
