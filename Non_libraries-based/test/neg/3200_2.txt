i m a big fan of the first critters movie  the second episode is good but it s not as good as the first critters  the third episode is a little bit boring but lovely  and what is this  what a crap  it s stupid and really really boring  it s the worst of the series  i can t watch it again because i felt asleep at the first watch  and ug s evil side eee  that s one of the most horribble moments of the movie  in the first   minutes we can t see the little furry monsters that s the reason why the audience fell asleep at the beginning of the movie   it could have been much better
