 quit while your ahead  is a phrase they never learn  typical hollywood sequel scenario  if the first film was only shocking  the second wasn t  expect the third to be the worst thing to hit the screen this year  even worse are the prequels  events of which were already explained in detail  if you haven t seen to first two films you will not like this one  it s like starting to watch lord of the rings or star wars with the last trilogy movie  so  stand alone  this film is not   remember in the first movie about lucians revenge  remember the second about the long lost savage brother  well if you saw those two   min moments and paste them together you would get
 a   min prequel  but the creators ether thought these   min were vital historical events or just wanted to give a job to some actors  cast and crew and maybe make some money in the process   i have a loot of money  i make movies for a living and i m bored  what will i do  i know  i ll make a movie  so anyway you get this   min prequel and you stretch it for   min   that s this movie  and you know what will happen to the main  immortal  characters  so there is little suspense  by the way  all the drama of the movie is in those   min  the only thing that made my eyebrow rise was mom killing in the begging of the movie  sick  the rest was braveheart remix  if you want a comedy  see braveheart first then this movie   now i m going to rant a bit   the movie put me in the mood  who invented the concept of  vampire vs  werewolf  in the first place  it s older than i am and got old just as fast  and why do vampires look like goth girls in heat  while werewolves look like psycho bears  hiding bad films behind cleavage fails  isn t it about time we got some sane slimmer werewolves with an upright posture  how can their unchangeable werewolves even breed if they rip everybody into shreds  and why with all their powers the vampires didn t rule the world  blaa  blaa  blaa
 what a waste
