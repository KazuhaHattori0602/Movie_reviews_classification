first things first   though i believe joel schumacher is at best a mediocre director and more often  as here  downright bad  the lion s share of the blame for this ugly travesty of a film must go to john grisham whose novel this is based on   set at an undetermined point in time  the  s  the  s  now  the film opens with the rape and murder of a child by rednecks so caricatured that their purpose seems to be to reassure racists that  at least we re not that bad 
 cut to the bad guys arriving at the courthouse when the girls father  samuel l jackson  fearful they will get off on some technicality  guns them down in cold blood before the trial    the setting is a  deep south  that probably never existed   the few black characters live in shacks and seem to pick cotton  the dyed in the wool racists  kiefer sutherland is a cartoon version of a klansman  are laughable in their villainy  the set piece is the trial  for the defence  are the  good guys    a milquetoast lawyer played by matthew mcconaughey as though in a coma  his assistant played by sandra bullock s breasts  she doesn t seem to serve any other narrative purpose  and donald sutherland as the requisite drunk lawyer who sobers up to fight the good fight  for the prosecution  kevin spacey goes through the motions of being demon spawn  while in the town at large  crosses are burned  witness are intimidated and the local citizens don t seem to care
   some of the reviews here claim the film immoral  since surely samuel jackson is a killer and should trust to the forces of the law rather than get off on a feeble heart tugging piece of oratory by matthew mcconaughey  to be honest  objectionable though the underlying message  vigilante justice is good  might be  everything about the movie stinks  the characterizations are pitiful  the acting leaden  the direction plodding  the screenplay and the dialogue almost verging on parody  peter menzies lush   s technicolor cinematography is pretty but derivative    and it goes on for nearly two and a half hours    what s left to say  this is a waste of   minutes of anyone s life  it is tedious  vacuous and hammy  and  almost as an afterthought  it is morally repugnant
