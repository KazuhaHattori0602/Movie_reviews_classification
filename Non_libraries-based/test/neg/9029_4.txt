allegedly the  true story  of juana de castilla  the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella  yes  the same who funded columbus s expedition  the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband  the archduke philip of austria  known as  the handsome   and played in a rather unispired manner by italian hunk daniele liotti  at his most buttery and beefy here  this is a groan inducingly familiar story of late  th c  early  th c  intrigue  betrayal and bodice ripping  it drips destructive lust from start to finish  but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless  cut throat intrigue entertaining to watch  juana la loca just doesn t pull off  it just ends up feeling like a big budgeted soap opera  with below average  lazy or over keen acting  liotti looks positively bored and pilar l pez de ayala in the title role   though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent   just seems to be trying too hard  switching back and fourth from two dimensional horny looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through  some of the supporting cast are ok  with the exception of manuela arcuri  another italian pin up  voluptuous and beautiful but really no  actress  to speak of  i couldn t in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character  nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains  what a waste of a substantial film budget  this one  sadly  is just so rhetorical and deja vu  nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material   history   for inspiration  it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film maker to evoke it
