cult purchasers are unquestionably familiar with the term  video nasties  this was a notorious british list containing all the films that could bring  damage  to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences  dramatization  for gore buffs  this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhumanly cruel and disturbingly realist movies  faces of death  cannibal holocaust  driller killer  as well as outrageous and ultra sick horror films  the burning  nightmare city  the toolbox murders  keeping this in mind  it s quite unusual to see  night of the bloody apes  listed among the other  nasties  it sure is gory
but the blood and violence are so poorly presented i can t imagine anyone would be offended by it  and the silly plot  about a desperate doctor transplanting a gorilla s heart into the chest of his dying son  isn t exactly what you would call disturbingly real  neither  all that remains is a fairly amusing pulp horror flick with awful acting and pointless sleaze  the man ape make up effects are laughable and there s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere  enjoyable only if you re in the right mood  in other words  the few sequences showing detailed matches of lady wrestling  which one of the lead actresses does for a living  are very cool
