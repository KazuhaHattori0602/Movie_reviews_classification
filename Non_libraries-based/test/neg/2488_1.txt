i was expecting a documentary covering the   to   era of sci fi and received a big ol  commercial laced with leftist political innuendo by james cameron and movie mogul baby boomer s pushing the own works   watch the skies  has in the past referred to the  giant bug  and  space exploration  movies from the  s including such favorites as  earth vs  the flying saucers   thing from another world  and  forbidden planet  as well as  them   deadly mantis  and  tarantula  there are lower budget examples that rarely get mentioned like  space monster    to the moon  and  cosmic man    this would have been a much better documentary had the few remaining actors  directors  stunt men and collectors plus the non hollywood  boomer s from the era been interviewed  i only wish there was a   rating available since a   is much to generous
