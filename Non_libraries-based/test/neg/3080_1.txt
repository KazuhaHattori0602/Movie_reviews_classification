committed stars  heather graham  along with  casey affleck  and  luke wilson  its the story of joline who is determined to find her ex husband who is in the process of a mid life crisis    committed was not at all what i expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre  it was beyond stupid and un realistic  casey affleck delivered a reasonable performance  graham s recent roles have been lack luster and this is not an improvement   graham s most recent role was blessed which i also found misleading and didn t appeal to me at all   pros affleck  cons predictable  unrealistic  poor acting and not a comedy movie
