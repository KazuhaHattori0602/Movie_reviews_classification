i m sure that any legitimate submariner would happily ship out on the usos seaview  yes  sos  why  you could play full court basketball in the torpedo room  it s so large  and how  bout the bay windows in the bow  the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere  did i mention the colorful mess cook with the parrot on his shoulder  and the admiral s stateroom with what appears to be a loft  big bleeping sub   ok  ok it s never gonna win any prizes for authenticity  and if the sub is laughable  the plot is even worse  somehow the van allen belts of radiation  hundreds of miles in space  have  caught fire  are going to make global warming look like a weenie roast  pompous admiral nelson  walter pidgeon  along with his sidekick lucius  peter lorre  looking suitably uncomfortable  hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst   there s plenty of intrigue  sic  along the way  with a born again survivor  and his little dog  too  two  dames  who can never leave well enough alone  a passel of  red shirts  who are expendable  and plot holes big enough for godzilla to walk through  thrill to the seaview being chased at what looks like   miles per hour by another sub   no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from   feet astern   the movie careens from one cliff hanger to another  the payoff is so anticlimactic as to be pointless  certainly not worth the   hour and   minute wait   the technical adviser for this shipwreck must have been a  year old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines  worth watching  if only to riff upon
