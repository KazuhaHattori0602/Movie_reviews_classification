i m going to be generous here and give it a   only because i live in huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed  that said  this movie was pretty bad  it s like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it  and billy d  williams looked like he d rather be anywhere but in this movie  it s just a mess  i think i could write a script better than the dislodge for this film  and i m no writer   there is one thing i ve seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boards everyone is under the impression that the movie begins around world war   and actually it seemed more like it was supposed to start out in the late  s early  s  while the military was not segregated by then  i m pretty sure that any troops waiting to board a train would still be segregated in a place like huntsville  al  if the beginning of film was supposed to be the  s  then billy d  lesley ann   rae dawn would have to have been in the  s and  s instead of their mid  s or early  s   don t waste your time unless you really  really like the actors because the story isn t very interesting
