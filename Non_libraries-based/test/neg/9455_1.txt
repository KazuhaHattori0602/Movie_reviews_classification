bought for   project vampire is one of the worst movies i have ever seen  wooden acting lame effects and a terrible storyline all add up to be a movie you have no reason to even want to see  pv is one of those movies that don t even have the good grace to be bad in an enjoyable way  instead this bile seems to try to make itself as offensively dull stupid and crap as humanly possible   a vampire has created a serum he sells to old people as a life enhancer  and those who take it fall under his control  a former lab intern teams up with a nurse to try and stop him  someone should have stopped the makers of this rubbish   no one has any reason to see this movie  and i am actually appalled at the human race on the grounds that at time of writing   people have given this atrocity   out of
