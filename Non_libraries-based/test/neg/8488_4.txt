actually  son of the mask did make me laugh a few times mostly due to the cartoonish jokes that made bugs bunny and roadrunner so funny  the cgi is very impressive and is used extensively in this movie  garfield  for example  is no where on par for cgi  but i would give it the same vote   everyone knows the story which wasn t that bad for a kids movie  yes  it is a kids movie and therefore should be treated as such  jamie kennedy is not very good in his role  his attempts to act  crazy  are not very good and overall acting is poor   everyone else is not too bad   basically  my   and   year old watched the whole thing without complaining  at least i was able to sit through this   there is no way this movie is worst than  shudder  class of      for the cgi and a few laughs
