this movie is just as bad as it gets  if you like logic  or the lack of it    la national treasure and bad acting as well  then it could be a movie for you   otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer   actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved  ie  actors  special effects and so on  accidentially they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent   in a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product   it is really lousy
