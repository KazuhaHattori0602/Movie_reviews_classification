i was out of town  visiting an old friend  after dinner  talking  he expressed some reservations about his daughter s boy friend  she s   beautiful  smart  athletic  and the young man is also from an excellent family  nice  also athletic  if not as smart  i told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns  however  a few minutes later the young man arrived  with his dvd of this flick  which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others    these folks have a bona fide home theater set up  with a screen something in excess of   feet  and the two young folks preceded to view it  while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame by frame   i saw enough in a few moments  and with some fascination in its awfulness  to endorse all of the most critical comments i ve seen in scanning some here   i told my friend i wouldn t go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus   but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch   some flicks are so bad they re good  the classic  plan   from outer space  and  in my opinion  the wonderfully awful bruce jenner village people work   can t stop the music   however  this one remains firmly simply in the awful category   second third fourth  bananas    even the best of these  e g  tim conway  don knotts  everybody with seinfeld  have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series  or  as here  film  and these were great supporting characters in their original situations   the  eddie  character  really at about the  th  or  th banana level in the prior griswald movies  and never added a whole lot to these  in my opinion  randy quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances  his contribution to the prior  vacation  pic s was average  at best  both he and the other cast members  many of whom have done some good work in the past  accomplished nothing for their efforts here  except to derive a few years  house payments or some ira contributions   this whole presentation   story  performances  from lead to support  couldn t be worse
