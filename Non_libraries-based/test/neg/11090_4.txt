julie delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in france of the  th century  the film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight  by showing a rather dreary image of the period  defined by psychological dysfunction  and violence    the movie opens with a child  fran ois  growing up in the shadow of the hundred years  war  told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return  fran ois takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed  fran ois murders him in the name of defending his father s honour  like father like son  fran ois grows up  and leaves his family  also to go to the same war  this setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come  as on his way home  we already notice that something is wrong with fran ois  the war has not done well with him  he has changed   the daughter  b atrice de cortemart  delpy  awaits her beloved father  to return from captivity of the english  she is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone  in her father s absence  b atrice needs to deal with financial difficulties  which strengthens b atrice s hope that her father will return to save her  but  upon his return  she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life  and he tortures and humiliates everything around him  even his own daughter  from this points the film depicts various ways how fran ois torments his family  starting with humiliating his own son  and ending with the rape of his own daughter  b atrice   setting the film in the middle ages supposed to soften the blow  as the viewer may tell himself  that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times  and indeed  many films on the topic of incest  such as tim roth s  the war zone   which are contemporary were more shocking because of that   delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes  indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful   i was annoyed when i saw some animal torture scenes  i believe  and this is not confirmed  that some birds were killed for the making of this film  which really upsets me  the quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals  i would hope that this movie will be re released without those cruelty scenes  those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline   overall  the movie is too long  the script is problematic  we don t get to see fran ois and b atrice before the war  we don t really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme  i would have pass on this film  however  i have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching     scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking  i saw it first time on  city of god   here  fran ois  murders his mother s lover  while his father away at war  excellent scene and very graphic    the scenes from b atrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting  the scene after the rape  where delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself  she asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage     the brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son s head into the food   humiliating him then ranting about the war  later  dressing his son with women s cloths   the film won the c sar  french oscar  for best costume design  i agree  the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period  the movie location is ch teau de puivert  a real  th century castle and a historical monument  located in aude  south central france  beautiful castle and mountain view  really helps you set into the period of this film  the film also nominated for   more c sar awards  but they were all snatched to the widely successful french film  au revoir  les enfants   goodbye  children       released as  beatrice  in new york city  march   only to be screened in france on november   watched it on yes  on   may     at work
