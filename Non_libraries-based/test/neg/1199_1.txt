ok  the very idea is ludicrous     kids don t own planes   kids don t race planes with dirtbikes   it made the air force look like total idiots   the kids father would not jeopardize his entire career to allow his boy to joyride with him   neither would a reserve colonel  the sequels  i am sure were worse than this tripe  the soundtrack is about the only redeeming quality of this waste of celluloid  i am sorry but i just don t understand why in the world anyone would write direct and produce such unbelevable junk  the iranian air force is lucky to filtch a couple parts for an ageing f  and this kid wrangles not   but   fully loaded and fueled f s  gimme a break
