a friend of mine  who is even more into  s cult films than myself  recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that i watched  however  i was not as enthusiastic about the result as he   or  for that matter  michael elliott   was  the film is a hybrid of house of wax   and the texas chain saw massacre   indeed  i would venture to say that it served as the basis of the   remake of the former much more than the  original  did  so  we have a remote and derelict wax museum of incredibly lifelike dummies  guess why that is  with its apparently harmless curator  a hammy chuck connors  being  invaded  by the obligatory group of stranded teenagers  among them tanya roberts  he also has a mad brother   shades of psycho   incorporated for good measure  down to the self same twist   who is supposed to be a mechanical genius  showcased in a  poltergeist  which unaccountably accompanies the first murder  the film does benefit from a pino donaggio score but  being so derivative and not especially well made to boot  essentially ends up merely a redundant  and fairly muddled  genre effort
