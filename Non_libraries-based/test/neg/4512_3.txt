i saw and have the original   black and white that stars shelley winters and millie perkins and no matter how many times i watch it  i can t help but not to cry   this version was  obviously  a set  like the   was  but there were so many mistakes in layout  spiral staircase  items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film  doris roberts  sad to say cannot play drama  she a comedic actress and that will not change  james coco was a horrible mr  van daan and mr  dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play  in the original film  anne walked the  gauntlet  to go to peter s room  that seemed to take her more then a minute  in this crappy remake  it took her under   seconds  the first reviewer was correct  this remake is just that  a remake  what was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that  i m sorry but james coco cannot play drama  max  schell was better in deep impact then this movie  the cranky mrs  frank was just that cranky  i couldn t stand her  referencing and comparing to the   version  i like her better  she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother  out of   stars  i give this remake   don t waste your time  get the   version and a box of kleenex
