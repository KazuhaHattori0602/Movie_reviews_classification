this is so poor it s watchable   the plot deals with a grizzled spaceship crew happening upon a drifting  apparently abandoned russian craft   in the empty vastness of space  the two craft accidentally collide     and  alien esque fun ensues as a cyborg from the russian ship menaces our crew   the spacecraft interiors are clearly a dolled up factory set  metal walkways  boilers  piping  in this entirely unconvincing setting   kody   snake  and the rest of our hero crew grimace  grunt  run about and continually and repeatedly rack their shotguns without firing them   the continuity gaffes are what define this movie  and they are nothing short of amazing   stuff appears and disappears  the shotguns are racked  a cigar gets longer by being smoked  the shotguns are racked again  just to make sure  content of a bottle increases by being drunk from   the film progresses through the usual clich s by way of intense ham acting  poxy camera work and ed wood quality props to a showdown climax
