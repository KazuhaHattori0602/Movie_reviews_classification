this was such a terrible film  almost a comedy sketch of a noir film the budget was low compared to a blockbuster  but still higher than most but its where they ve decided to cut costs that is totally weird some actors are at least competent  while others look like they just been dragged off the street one of them being the lead actor  hes so very bad that i cringed when ever he said anything  he talks through the entire movie then there s the weird costume choices at the start of the movie all characters are wearing  s clothes they drive a classic car  but the background is a modern day windfarm thats blatantly state of the art and the costumes and some settings continue to follow this  s film noir theme then bam in drives a brand new escalade with   inch rims wtf same thing again when a guy has a night scope on his rifle  you get a shot down its sight hes aiming at a guy with an mp  and tactical gear on in a even stranger contrast the locations are brilliant  and seem to have cost more than the rest of the entire film the camera shots angles a very good  and show these locations brilliantly in the scenes the director has a keen eye for a good looking single shot  but no idea how to do much else   people who should be shot for this film   the writer the director the casting agent the costume designer  people who should be tortured to death for their monotone  monotonous nails on chalk board voice   anton pardoe  the lead actor  writer  producer if you ever seen the movie hostel  i wish that would happen to this guy  but he doesn t escape
