this has got to be the worse move i ve ever seen  it was not only boring  it was  gag me with a spoon  dumb  where d ya find the actors   on a street corner  who did the special effects maaco  for god s sakes i could have made a better movie with my cell phone  and if that wasn t bad enough  you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just how stupid the actors are in real life  who ever did the makeup for the aliens must have spent   at your local used costume store and called it a day  and who in the world wrote up the movie description on the back of the dvd case should be shot  puhleez  it s not even     of what it is described as  that description is just to suck people in to buying  renting or paying a ticket to see it  no wonder there was never a trailer to it ya would have drove them all away   bad actors    special effects    fake fire   cigarette lighter    time spent watching this movie total waste   i should sue ya for my time watching it
