just seen which way to the front  on tcm  uk  it is a truly awful film  if i d paid at the pictures i d have walked out   a terrible mess of a film  byers  lewis  and his mates prance around in cast off uniforms from an italian sci fi movie of  s  were the cnd peace symbol badges on the uniforms meant to be ironic  the sets were pure   i m sure a hollywood tv back lot could have provided a more realistic set   the film is riddled with racism  the film takes the mickey out of veterans    not funny how lewis every got to make another film is beyond me
