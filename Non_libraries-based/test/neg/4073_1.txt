i should have gone without seeing the movie after reading the review here  i saw the whole movie by fast forwarding and ended in   minutes  though its a low budget movie it could have been made better    the movie starts more like a thriller and in few minutes it tells you that you should switch off immediately  and why was the movie named  crash landing  when it was landed so well in such a bad climate    without any acting  all the characters where just moving or doing like kids   and should not forget to comment on the joker   the main hijacker who would have been more suitable if this movie was a full time comedy
