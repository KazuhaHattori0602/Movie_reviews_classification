what could ve been a great film about the late poker pro  pre poker craze  stu  the kid  unger turned into a disappointment   you can tell the filmmakers were working on a short string budget  everything look filmed on the cheap  timelines seemed a bit off to me   casting michael imperoli from the sopranos was also a bad casting choice  he looked too old to play the baby faced stu  he looked way too healthy for a coke addict  if you look at footage from the   wsop main event  the real stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them  and i kept expecting adriana to pop up and yell  chris tu phur    also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from angie s previous relationship that committed suicide in the late  s   every time i saw vincent van patten appear  i kept thinking he was going to announce  show tunes going off in stu s head  like he does on the wpt   if you re looking for real stuey footage  check espn classic because they rerun the   wsop main event every so often  or try youtube  avoid this move like a bad beat
