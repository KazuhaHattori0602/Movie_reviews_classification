sure  this flick set in eastern europe is filled with sexy  but it absolutely has nothing to do with the nicholas cage flick  mm  an ambassador s daughter and her fianc e mix it up with a local woman in a threesome that ends up being taped  the tape is used for blackmail and the stakes get higher and higher as the couple try to work it out themselves instead of going to authorities   the sex comes and goes   and would be the only reason for renting it  i suppose if you like this sorta thing   and is quite gratuitous towards the middle when we cruise along the porn scene looking for the  other woman  i definitely question how it got into blockbuster even with a youth restricted sticker considering how just a hint over the edge of soft core it is   oh that s right  it s the double standard  actual art house flicks like  the dreamers  and  y tu mama tambien  get castrated r versions  but straight to dvd crap like this get the unrated banner proudly attached  whatever    the acting is horrible  the plot is mind numbingly unoriginal  but really the worst offense is the idea that this is a sequel to  mm  i d give the flick a d for a grade and be nice  but considering they tried to trick me  it gets the f it frankly deserves
