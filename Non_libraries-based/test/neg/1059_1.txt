well  this movie shows us that mark griffiths and producers think we all are idiots  if not how should we understand this   american pilots take off on mig s  suddenly all aircrafts turn to f s  ha  a magic  after an action  migs land  the magic again   oh  did i mention that f s had israel markings    another magic  obviously unarmed l  trainers are bombing enemies   and more magic  while all movie is situated in europe  we can see a desert in almost any flying scene   maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above  because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs   ok  ok  this is a movie  i should write about its story  wait  a story  yes there is some story in this film  and its horrible as well
