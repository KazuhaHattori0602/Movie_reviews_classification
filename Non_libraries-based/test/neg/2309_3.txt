to preface my remarks on the film  i know the topic is horrendous and words can t adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them    however  this film doesn t really deal with in a horrific way except for the first   minutes  some of the images there are horrifying  and should be as a reminder what devastation nuclear weapons can produce  seeing burned people walking around aimlessly or man combing his hair and clumps of hair coming out  etc  is not a pretty sight    but after the first dozen minutes  this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of hiroshima in the mid to late  s  i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera    almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one family s problems at that point  this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster  it s simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about   on  whether one of the women was permanently damaged and if so  should she marry    this could have been a real impact film but it didn t go in that direction
