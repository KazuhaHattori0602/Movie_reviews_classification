ok  this is one strange film  fans of ed wood jr  will appreciate the  inventive  techniques director george barry utilizes  like stock footage and cheesy voice overs  he can make a crack in the wall into a plot device  there is more humor than horror here  but i found it an uneven blend  you will be laughing and crying  and probably wondering why you got your hands on this  barry explains in the introduction that filming began on this movie in   and was completed in   at a cost of   that s   months and   too much  if you like your cheese on the campy side  with vintage  s  gore  you might find this an irresistible and freaky snack
