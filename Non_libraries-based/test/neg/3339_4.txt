pretentious claptrap  updating herman melville   about a young man s vaguely incestuous relationship with his aristocratic mother getting transferred to his long lost sister who has been raised by gypsies  or something like that   not that anyone really cares to unravel its multi layered plot decked out with pornographic sex scenes  pseudo symbolic imagery  the siblings swimming in a river of blood  and other bizarre touches  a gypsy child repeatedly insults passers by in the street until she is anonymously beaten to death  the deafening music of a rock group utilized in the demolition of old buildings  considering the source material and the presence of catherine deneuve  who at least gets to bathe in the nude  i was expecting a lot more from this one  apparently  there s an even longer tv version of pola x out there
