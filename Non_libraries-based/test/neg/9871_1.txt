whether or not this adaptation of the marvel comic was made   and shelved   so its production company could retain the copyright to the characters  it doesn t change the fact that it s utter rubbish  the dr  doom and  especially  thing costumes are surprisingly good  but everything else suffers from a deficit of either cash or talent  director oley sassone can t even point a camera at stuff without including such howlers as a blind woman s pov  the dialogue is absolutely dismal  the team s costumes don t fit properly  and the effects are appalling  the human torch seems to be drawn onto the film with felt tip pens  while mr  fantastic s powers are brought to life using a bendy blue stick with a glove on the end  joseph culp compensates for having to wear a mask by wildly waving his arms about  jay underwood is incredibly annoying  the rest of the cast hit various levels of terrible  and while it s hard not to feel sorry for all these guys who thought this movie would get a release  it s equally difficult to imagine any of them believing it was actually any good
