from the acting  direction  scriptwriting and art direction this film is just entirely ill conceived and the money would have been better spent on shoes for land mine victims  when did we get so sad that they have to fill a a children s movie with sexual innuendo to keep the parents attention   dr suess is rolling in his grave right now  what with the  dirty ho   s h i t  and fake erection scenes etc etc etc  its shameful how they trade on the name of suess to get the parents to bring their kids  throw in the profanities to try for the teens and a few sad parents who won t watch a a film with their child if there is no t   a  greed greed and more greed   compare this to the classic children s films and we can get a disturbing view of world is turning into  these guys should stick to making mtv videos  how on earth this movie got   votes as a perfect   is beyond me   unless its the directors family
