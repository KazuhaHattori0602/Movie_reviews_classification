positively ridiculous film   if doris roberts  shirley jones and shirley knight persist in these kinds of films  they can submit their retirement papers and collect social security full time   while the idea that a   year old swinger  who works on video games  loses his apartment and his forced to move in with grandma roberts and borders jones and knight  this is foolishly dealt with  imagine the   bags getting high on stuff that grandson alex has left in their home and jones going to bed with someone who may qualify as her grandson   the video game sequences are as foolish as the rest of the film  the assortment of characters that alex works with is beyond belief as he enjoys his weed habit along with the others   terrible best describes this miserable film
