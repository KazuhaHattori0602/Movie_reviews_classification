with a title like that  you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter  goya  then after half an hour you decide it is more about the roman catholic inquisition  with even more latitude  perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period  with lurid characterisation  too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact  milos forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic  rambling mish mash that fails on all three accounts   milos forman  who lost his jewish father to nazi concentration camps  is the great director who painted the artist mozart as a buffoon and got away with it  won awards for it  in fact  his life in czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse  repellent regimes  especially communism  he also made the equally over the top but rather impressive  one flew over the cuckoo s nest  so  at the age of   how does he come to offer us this mess  in goya s ghosts  goya is one step removed from buffoon  the main character is brother lorenzo  passionately acted by javier bardem  natalie portman is equally vibrant as goya s model ines  and later in the film  her own daughter  the tenuous connection with goya is that he happens to paint both of them   lorenzo tortures  and then rapes  ines who he suspects of being a jew  her father tortures lorenzo  napoleon dashes in to liberate spain  briefly  ines gets out of the dungeon the church has left her in and searches for her child  goya is still painting but has gone deaf  his main preoccupation seems to be helping ines  and so on   historically  goya was also a historian  as forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of goya the painter  this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together   a large slice of history as seen by goya  but the painter is too tangential to receive any weight  similarly  a document of the terrors of the inquisition should be done   compared to other despotic orders throughout time  the holy see has been forgiven with barely a confession  though one might ask if forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything    i thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story  he says in the production notes   there were a great many parallels between the communist society we lived under and the spanish inquisition  but the story is too tenuous to hold our attention  against our expectations and with a background of something major  the life of a great painter  the horrors of the inquisition  and even the french revolution  we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted  if kind  infatuation of goya s  the result is that we feel cheated   background detail is appallingly handled  goya went deaf in    when the film starts  not   years later  napoleon is as believable as a cut out from a cereal packet  we see the church passing out a death sentence  when the normal procedure was for the church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work  battles look overly choreographed and stagey  a peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it   on the positive side  the production values are mostly good  the colours are vivid  the pacing excellent  at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline  bardem is excellent  and portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman  while it doesn t say very much about goya  what it does say is nice  even if superficial and pretty irrelevant   i once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and i asked each other  if you could choose a director to depict your life  who would it be  on his record  forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list
