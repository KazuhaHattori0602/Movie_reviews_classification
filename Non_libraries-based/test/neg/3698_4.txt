this is the kind of movie that begs to be shown on tv at   or   in the morning  if at all   no doubt the film makers responsible for  attack of the   foot woman  thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum  all wrapped up in a sci fi allegory    or maybe it was a tax write off   either way   attack  proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances  a  extreme intoxication  b  seen on a double bill with any of those jacqueline suzanne movies  maybe  once is not enough  or c  just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect  pop in  attack  and you ll feel great  guaranteed   it s good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script  the rubbery special fx and that four eyed sheriff  and i think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in washington d c    it s just that memorable   four stars for  attack of the   foot woman  buy a copy  mail it to gloria steinem   she ll love you for it
