this is not a good film by an standards  it is very poorly written and the acting is just a little above par  some performances are well below par  but swayze and grey do a very good job with little to work with   what was good   the dance sequences were choreographed very well and  as stated above  swayze and grey were high points   what was bad   the script  the  bad  guys were simply too evil to be believable  the best villains are the ones who aren t so obviously evil  these guys  the owner s nephew  the waiter who impregnates the girl  do and say nothing that would leave me to believe they could be real people  perhaps there are guys like them  but i sure don t want to see a movie about it   another scene  the first where grey and swayze meet when the employees at the resort are  dancing  swayze and grey dance together and seem to enjoy themselves  the next time they meet  swayze is hostile towards her  why  what happened in between to make him dislike her so when they danced well together   and some of those lines  i mean come on  i cringed at the end when swayze muttered the line  nobody puts baby in the corner  how did he ever do that with a straight face   another thing wrong  the setting of the  s  everyone looked and dressed like the  s  who was in charge of the costumes and hairstyles   the music  original music for the film  was laughable  with the exception of  i had the time of my life  which was a good song   not the worst film i ve ever seen  but definitely the most over rated
