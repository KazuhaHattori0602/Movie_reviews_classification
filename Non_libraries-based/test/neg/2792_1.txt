bad script  check  awful effects  check  horrible actors  check  lame direction  check   after seeing the dvd box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre  i placed my   on the line and rented this  film  my girlfriend was out of town and i was bored so on a late tuesday night i decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch  what appeared to be  based on the box cover art  a horror movie  what i got instead was the worst film ever made  up until that point i had always declared  slumber party massacre   the worst film ever made   if you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is  this is for you  if you don t want to lose   and   irreplaceable minutes of your life  steer clear of this garbage   an added note  i noticed a few of the  actors  come on here and post comments on the bulletin board  how can you brag about being in this film  you were all horrible  i mean really bad  if there was an american idol for actors  you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes   peace   sutter cain
