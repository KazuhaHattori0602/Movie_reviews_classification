i think this movie lacks so much of substance  it is even not worth a discussion   in the first  the package is really disgusting  especially the stereotype filming and photographing  surely  joe dante s cinematic stile was appropriate and interesting in  gremlins  and  small soldiers  i mean the imaginative and visual pretty story telling of a spielberg wunderkind  i really loved these movies  but in  homecoming  it was a completely failure  attacks of toy soldiers and hairy creatures is simply not comparable with zombie invasions  dead  stinky  rotten beings trying to kill the living   without any logical reason  just because they hate them    zombie flicks are characteristic in plain  direct  unconventional and brutal cinematography  nothing to be seen in joe dante s debut  another point is the annoying content  really stupid dialogs between the two main characters  a gruesome exploitation of the  elder brother dies and leaves the younger traumatized  and bad acting  and  by the way  homecoming  is neither scary  nor gory   and even less entertaining  you see  it is even not a horror movie   zombie movies in the decade of their birth   it the end of  s  start of the  s   used to be revolutionary  provocative  espicially through its gruesome  explicit content  and of subtle social critic  the original zombie film was actually a midnight movie named  night of the living dead    this one was a low budget movie that covered so many controversial themes  it s hard to name them all  a visual style of hitchcock raimi  the american lifestyle of the  s  political aloofness  the upcoming breakthrough of the human rights of black people and the even more upcoming racism as a result on the side of the conservative americans  remember the shooting of the black main character in the end of the movie   if you are interested in the creativity of midnight movies and want to learn more about the most important ones  i recommend you  midnight movies  from the margin to the mainstream    so steer clear of  homecoming  and even so of romero s  land of the dead
