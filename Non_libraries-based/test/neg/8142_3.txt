the film is a pathetic attempt to remake ingmar bergman s  autumn sonata  starring ingrid bergman liv ullman and erland josephson it did not take me more than   minutes to figure that out   it is time film journalists like khalid mohammad took out time to do some creative thinking  it makes me sad when potentially good film makers waste their talents by making substandard remakes of hollywood and european films   you ve got to give the film maker something though  the film he picked for copying is one of bergman s classics  and easily one of the finest instances of the portrayal of a strained human relationship in european cinema
