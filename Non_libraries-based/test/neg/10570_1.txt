this movie is somehow showing   stars  it seems inconceivable that the director has that many relations  i am at a loss to explain this   avoid this movie at all costs  you have only a certain number of hours on the earth  don t waste   of them on this retarded steaming heap of guano   there is no story as apparently the director  wrote   and i m guessing with a blunt orange crayon  the next day s script at the completion of the day s shooting  the  story  has been called whimsical  no it is aimless  there is maybe enough  story  to fill a commercial  don t you hate ads   now while both leads can act they obviously decided not to here  and similarly the writer director can actually both write and direct as evidenced by his next work  toy love    so to recap  even if you get this movie for free  even if you re paid to watch it avoid it   to paraphrase monty python s search for the holy grail   run flee
