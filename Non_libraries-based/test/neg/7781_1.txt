if you want a complete waste of time  because pulling lint out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or grouting your tile is your idea of a carnival thrill ride  then you ll not want to miss this one   for one thing  forget the vhs cover  no body in this movie looks that attractive  ie  the indian girl  someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and i agree  the cover is the most exciting thing about this movie   to put this in perspective  i bought this vhs for   cents at k mart and three minutes  no    seconds into the movie  i knew i had been ripped off   i finished watching it because   i did pay   cents after all and   there might possibly  conceivably been a hair of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched loaf   there wasn t   good grief  fonda  i know you were hard up for roles when you did this  but this is beneath you
