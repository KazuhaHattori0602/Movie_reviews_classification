this series continues to frustrate and annoy  how are they going to drag this out for another year  each episode offers up more and more questions  whilst providing the answers to very few  to quote another very popular website  i believe that this show has now jumped the shark   will  i keep watching it   probably   will they manage to keep the show on air till it ends   probably not   how did two qualified doctors fail to notice that naomi was still alive  how did   plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back  how did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush kate   we ve now introduced a ghostbuster   same time next week  yep
