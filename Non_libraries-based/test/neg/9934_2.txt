i have been a rabid star trek fan since   still am  one thing i learned from star trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters  encounter at farpoint fails in its mission   superbly produced   poorly directed  written  acted  d c  fontana really blew this one  this episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned   the first half of the first season didn t fare much better
