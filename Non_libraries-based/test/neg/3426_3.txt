a very hyped up  slick  edgy reinterpretation   they ve fallen into the  because it s modern  it has to be hyped up  slick  etc  trap    romeo and juliet  carried this idea off much more successfully  but i really think it s time we move beyond the two extremes here  period piece vs  edgy film   just because this is a  modern  retelling  doesn t mean the movie has to look like a magazine ad  or have anything to do with drugs or guns   if the trappings were as subtle as the honeyed words  macbeth would be a far more powerful film  as it is  read your shakespeare  read it out loud  ask your oxford dictionary some questions  skip the film  or don t  but you ve been warned   sorry for the super long review  imdb made me do it
