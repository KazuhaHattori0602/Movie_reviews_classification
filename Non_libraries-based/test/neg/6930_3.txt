this film is supposed to be about the frustrations of film making  it certainly frustrated me with its endless boredom  the setting is an attractive spanish seacoast resort with his usual large cast  the script is very poorly written or maybe there was no script  just all ad lib   a far superior film about the frustrations of film making is francois truffaut s  day for night  made in   it shows all the delays and how the cast can misbehave in an intriguing manner  it doesn t bore the viewer and you gain sympathy for the director who somehow must complete the film
