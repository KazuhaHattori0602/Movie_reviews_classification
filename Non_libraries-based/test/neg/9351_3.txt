despicable villains in pursuit   this movie has the potential to be a really great comedic parody  star wars  david lynch s  dune  but was just not handled correctly  it goes for  i believe the term is   low brow  humor  it doesn t really succeed in being all that funny which is a shame since it has angelica houston  ron perlman and robert urich   hence the three stars  who aren t exactly slackers in the acting department   definitely a rental and definitely have a drink straight up
