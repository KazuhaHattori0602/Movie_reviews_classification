unfortunately  this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels  universal made several serial monster films in the  s  which were pale imitations of the original  the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg dragging frankenstein in mummy wrappings  who exhibits no signs of intelligent life  this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy   you will be disappointed
