hubie   like stanely the troll from bluth s a troll in central park   lacks the spark of personality to be the main character that carries an entire movie  we re supposed to like him because he s nice  but that s about all he is   his character design is unappealing  the top of his head is a sort of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of his head   and penguins should not have teeth  i know that iago the parrot in aladdin had teeth  but maybe that worked because it made him look more like his voice actor  gilbert gottfried  hubie  with his weenie little voice  provided by martin short  looks funny with that big set of chompers in his beak   tim curry  who is usually delightful at being evil  does some sort of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain  might have been a good voice for a comic relief accomplice  not the supposedly menacing main villain   the entire plot revolves around the hero and villain s love for female penguin marina  who is just as dull as both of her suitors   worst of all is the pacing  we keep cutting back to the villain to watch him threaten marina some more   this time in dialogue  this time in song   barry manilow may be a great songwriter  but in animated films like this and thumbelina  his songs feel limp and listless   especially the ballads  the only song i liked was the  s ish  good ship misery  song   i read that the distributor made some cuts in this film against the filmmaker s wishes  and that could have caused some of the problems   though i suspect the real problem is that they didn t cut the rest of it
