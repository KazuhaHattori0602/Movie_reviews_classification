i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info  i saw the   rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what i d seen   as reference  i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever  i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the  s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre    so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read  more  there i found several reviews with   or   stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development  poor editing  feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot  mgm s is long gone  and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld  my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was  less than a    this got me to wondering about the process that yields a   rating  if the people giving the  s and  s do not take the time to justify their vote  is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation  i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available  now i am not so sure
