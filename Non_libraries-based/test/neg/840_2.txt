   the film was actually shot in south africa  but i still wouldn t believe that at all   the movie goes on and on  ernest joke after ernest joke  the rest of the movie doesn t really make any sense either  the african tribesmen all speak english for some reason  and ernest is later challenged to a  battle of truth  by the lead henchman  who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja  yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive  the henchman has a table of axes  swords  knives  and maces before him  while ernest has a table with a sandwich  a teddy bear  and a few other worthless items  however  ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day   overall  this movie is painful to watch  i couldn t handle it in one sitting  i had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate varney s humor  they should really put a surgeon s general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie  i would have to say that out of all the movies i have ever seen  none comes close to being as pitiable as ernest goes to africa
