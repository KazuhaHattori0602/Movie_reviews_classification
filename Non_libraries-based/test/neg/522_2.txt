okay  i just had to sound off on this one  like a tremendous mental gimp  i ve just sat through this film in its entirety   you ll note that the trivia section of imdb points out that portions of the raising of the   were  borrowed  from airport   this really doesn t scratch the surface  virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean  landing in  sinking  and even the at rest shots are borrowed from airport   all of the  raising  shots are pulled from   including most of the interior flooding clips  with the exception of dennis weaver s drowning  i couldn t help but wonder if olivia dehavilland might come floating by at any moment  or maybe a  dead  tom sullivan  another eye roller  dennis weaver s name in this film is stevens  which is to compensate for the fact that airport  s plane is owned by the stevens corporation  headed by jimmie stewart of course   this is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don t work much  or at least haven t worked in a while  which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker   i ve rated this film a     it s quite worthy of a   but if this film can t offer any other redeeming quality  at least somebody helped coolio  max caulfield  nicolle eggert  and dennis weaver make their car payments that month
