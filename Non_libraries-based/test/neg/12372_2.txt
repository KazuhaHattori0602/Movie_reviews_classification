this terrible moovie is fun on many levels   the moost obvious is the lame  fake looking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets  without ever flapping it wings  like it was on a string  perhaps  attacking model trains and toy cars  the  science  is asinine   a masonic atom gun  and what s up with the enormous amounts of brylcream in everyone s hair  i guess the  s were the slimeball decade  well  this bird puppet apparently comes from  some god forsaken anti matter universe  and it s here to build a nest   lay eggs in new york  seriously  that they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame  i give it   hoof out of     it s silly and stupid  but moore fun than armageddon
