 spoiler  it gives away the very irrelevant ending   at the beginning of this movie  there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies  h g  lewis  he talked about how this movie was lost  and then found years after the director s death  he also talked about how gore movies were measured by the amount of stage blood used in it  blood feast was a   galloner    maniacs was a   galloner  but  then he goes and claims that dr  gore was a   galloner  i want to know where half of the   gallons went  watching the movie  i saw very little near   gallons  agreed  there was a fairly large amount of blood  but no where near   gallons  some of the dismemberment scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic  strings of flesh and all  but i wouldn t say   gallons    end  ennnnnnnnndddddd  does that sound familiar  that s what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie  after the igor character was tossed into the acid bath  the movie slowed to a painful crawl  there was no coherent end  as it didn t fit into anything the   minutes before it provided  she drove off in a van with a total stranger  big deal  that s what happens when you keep an individual  i won t say person  because she doesn t qualify as a person  very innocent about the world around her  the doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved  so every man she meets  she loves   even though h g  lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting  the directing  or even the gore  i will go with choices a and b  both were terrible  it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person  but  i made it through the movie  and came out stronger  too bad i couldn t say the same after finishing robo c h i c   this was a bad movie  i can usually take my doses of vinegar in good stride  but every once in a while  you get a movie that bites back  i think this movie took off an arm or a leg  haha   sigh  admitted  i did enjoy the stare down scenes  where the good doctor stared at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and just stared  it was very similar to fuad ramseys in blood feast when he stared at that lady in his catering shop  and did not use his power after that  i guess this movie picks up where fuad s powers left off    final judgement  the movie should have stayed lost  good day   scott
