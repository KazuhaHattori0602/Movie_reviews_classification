in the literal sense   reminds you of those  cops and robber  or cowboys indians  role playing games you played with your   year old friends    tedious and un inspired  the storyline was obviously written to make bad acting and dialogue seem as part of the plot  but all it does is showcase it  i cant believe john badham let his name be associated with this piece of crap  this could have been done better by a high school film buff who had been given the camera lighting  filmstock and editing  destined to be a time filler on sci fi channel  when they ve overused everything else from their library  and barely better than the paid programming shill downstream
