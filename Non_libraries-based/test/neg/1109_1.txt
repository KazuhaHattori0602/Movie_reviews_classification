all i could think while watching this movie was   will it ever end  it was unbearably boring to watch  i was wishing i could just turn it off  but i wanted to do this review justice so i fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you  the good reader  need not bear that pain also   this movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper  however  the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all   the opening scene features a mineshaft in the early  s  where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren t big enough for the adults to fit into  this seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie  but after   minutes  it becomes clear that is not the case  the adults who committed these crimes are never punished  there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions  the opening scene is way better than  and completely irrelevant to  the rest of the movie  the last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of   days later which was the only good scene in  that  whole movie  wicked little things zombies  a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it s crappiness and sell it again  is exactly the same in this regard  the opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie   instead  the movie flashes forward to present day  a single mother and her two bratty  foul mouthed kids  right here is when it would have been wise to press the stop button and never go near the movie again   in the first hour  the zombie kids are barely even seen  they get maybe   minutes of screen time  total  all they do is kill a pig  that s it  the rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store  wander around the forest  and have inane conversations with each other  the dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them   there would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie  every single character is both dumb   annoying  with no redeeming qualities at all  not to mention one dimensional and clich d   this movie would have been  vastly improved  if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first   minutes by the zombie kids  as they were driving up to their new house  then the end credits rolled  that right there would instantly change the score from   to   honestly  when the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road  her daughter scolds her   you almost killed us  mom  of course  anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian  it would be the pedestrian who would be dead   not the people safely encased  inside  the car  i guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds  and runs in the family   wicked little things zombies runs for   hour and   minutes  but it definitely felt like   hours or more to me  trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge  it s not until over an hour has passed into the   hour and   minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person  then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like   if you ever wanna get in my pants again  you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now  seriously  that s verbatim from the movie  the teenagers are so clich d  one dimensional  badly acted  dumb   annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking   of them up   hour and   minutes into the movie  it feels like a cause for celebration  of course the  princess  dumb weed smoking foul mouthed beer drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott free  what a buzzkill that was  she was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the   of them  and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head  all the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first   minutes  as aforementioned  to still keep her around past   hour and   minutes though  is totally inexcusable   the reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least   hour and   minutes  so by keeping her alive long past when she should be  they have an extra   minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods  by   hour and   minutes in  it s the  second  time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won t start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her   the zombie kids are completely generic  never say anything  no character development at all for any of them   in the end  all   of the annoying  idiotic main characters live  which in my opinion  is the filmmakers  way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience  in my opinion  the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie  why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the   main characters who should have been dispatched within the first   minutes  die   avoid wicked little things zombies like the bubonic plague
