ah animorphs  i loved the book series and eagerly devoured each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation  i was very excited   boy what a let down the final product was  i think for me  this was the moment when nickelodeon stopped being about cool programming and more generic   so what was wrong with the series  let me count the ways    the characters were horrifically miscast  in the books  the animorphs were somewhere between   the television cast were at least   i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos     horrific acting bad writing  i dunno which was to blame so i m lumping into the lumpy mass that it was  perhaps it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast hampered the humor that is at least cute coming out of a   year old because marco   not funny  in fact  i don t remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few  the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head smackingly pathetic at its worst     my lord they were stingy with the budget  the final result of the andalites alone should have convinced viacom to pull the plug their heads had clefts that clearly showed which was the helmet     back to the cast   rachel by far was the biggest let down  far from being the warrior woman in the books  the best equivalent in the tv series was  scarecrow  also  i know cassie was an idealist but there is a difference between  idealist  and  idiot     one of the worst opening titles ever  did the music have to be that obvious    answering question    yes  because everything else was dumbed down so why shouldn t the expectedly less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap rock rip off or whatever the hell that was   since then  there have been bigger let downs  iraq    but in case i haven t made myself clear   this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from
