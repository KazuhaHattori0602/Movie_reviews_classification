first off  i m a huge bronson fan  have been since the late  s  i watched every film he made on the big screen since  love and bullets  which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name  hollywood blockbuster star   i kept hoping that things would turn around for him  that he would make a really good film in the  s  but that never happened  and i don t know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j  lee thompson for most of his latter films    assasination  gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed  first off  the film looks incredibly cheap  like it was made for about   mil  minus bronson s inflated salary  i heard he insisted on   mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films  the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la   i was taking the bus when they were shooting  nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots  guess not   secondly  the supporting cast is really bad  ireland was dying of cancer and despite this she s not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronson s sidekick was typical of cannon s talent at the time  non existent  i would be real curious to learn how she got this role  i can t imagine a worse actress for the part  plus she s a good   years younger than bronson  the story is not that bad and it s something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later  eastwood s  in the line of fire  and costner s  bodyguard  film  but the way it s staged here is really sad  i m wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot  none of it is believable in the slightest  if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie we d have presidents rotating out of office  and out of life  every few months
