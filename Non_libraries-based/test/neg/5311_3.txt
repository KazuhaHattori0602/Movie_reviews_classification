the first   minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg  movies  these are the   reasons the movie is so bad  they constantly reference a movie called  get leo  which is the movie in a movie version of get shorty  every time they do this  you will be really angry  travolta isn t very cool  neither is keitel  however  the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious  they aren t the kind of funny you would expect to see in an elmore leonard movie though  if you haven t seen get shorty  you will probably like be cool  if you liked get shorty  you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter  wait for the dvd
