just been on sci fi channel uk   th july  its was   shame on jrd  may be he was bored one week   he cant be skint after lotr  i suppose he wasn t to blame  mr sheppird was  i turned off after   minutes  couldn t bear it  the cgi ship was bad and the creature looked like a large   foot bat  who funded this project  i think the whole thing must have cost   bucks  avoid at all costs  don t think about buying the dvd if they release one  i cant imagine they would spend dollars on producing one  lets hope someone makes a decent chupra film and a decent bigfoot movie  sasquatch was okay  poor lance  its a shame a big studio and direct wont risk it  no more super hero films please
