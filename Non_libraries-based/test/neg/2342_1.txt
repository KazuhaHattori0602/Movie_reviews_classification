to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clich s and boring stereotyped characters  nerds  jocks  popular girls  sleezy guys  etc  but with an underlying anti drug drinking theme    if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film  keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real  dunno how else to word it  i guess the only thing that d make this film cool  would be if they tv playing it was on fire  that  or dvd it was on exploded     out of     watch animal house instead
