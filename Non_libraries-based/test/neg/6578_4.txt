i like underdogs  so    years after having first seen star trek v  and thinking it was bizarrely bad  i gave it a second watch  hoping i would find some redeeming quality which i missed the first time around   i didn t   the writing is half baked  and although at first the quality of the acting is stable enough to keep the movie on its feet  albeit shakily  the further we get into the plot the sillier it gets  the last quarter of the film is just plain ridiculous  what was even worse  from the original cast s pov  is that this was the first st movie to be released after the franchise returned to television with next generation  and the average episode of next generation would put this to shame    including the special effects  what an embarrassment   the final frontier isn t thoroughly wretched   i gave it   out of     but it s so far below the standard of its predecessors  yes  including the first one  that the only reason i can think of to watch it is because you ll appreciate the other movies more     unless it s an episode with troi s mother in it
