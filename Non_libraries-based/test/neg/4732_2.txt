holy crap  the beginning picked up where the first one left off  good start  then it goes downhill from there  you it looked like as if you were watching tv and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera  a predator movie  and some crappy detective show  the characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don t have anything to do with each other until the final   minutes or so  the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual alien story   then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city   p s  what the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can t tell what s going on  seriously  movie makers  do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight
