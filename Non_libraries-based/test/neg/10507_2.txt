as i said  sometimes low budget is good  you get to see a good movie without a lot of the extra bs that can hide an otherwise piece of crap  well this was that piece of crap  if anything  i thought it had humor  unfortunately the humor was unintentional  the only half witted acting came from bill smith and his part was cut out  that s a joke  there was never a bill smith  nor was there anyone cast who could act  even gerald okamura sucked  and he s been cast in nearly   movies  the fight scenes were comical and made me feel like i could kick all their   the sound was horrible  as if all sound was recorded on the set  my   year old could have written a better script btw  my   year old fell asleep no kidding  i give a b  to editing for cutting the movie to only   minutes  minutes would have been an a
