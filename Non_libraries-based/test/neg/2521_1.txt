it s difficult to criticize a movie with the title like  deathbed  the bed that eats  and involves a ghost narrator who s trapped behind a  way painting he drew and a bed that snores and   if i m not mistaken  masturbates   now  that s getting back at its human companions  furthermore  it foams up  in orange  for whatever reason  to absorb edibles lying on its surface  including apples  wine  fried chicken and  of course  people  again it s suffice to say  that don t expect too much when you see what i guess is stomach acid   the final remains of anything that orange suds takes   dissolving only certain things  it ll drink the wine  but the bottle s okay and it ll eat away at the chicken bone  but the bucket s just fine  heck  the bed even replaces the unused containers  hilariously  at one point it downs pepto bismol  i had to laugh at that one  i don t think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously  it s low budget  and it s extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money  i thought  in a world where there can be a killer  lift  and a  blood beach  this  deathbed  might be amusing to watch  for reasons that might involve cost    of the film is voice over  no one screams or shows extremely low signs of fright confusion on why a bed would attack  i can think of one   and i never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed  and you ll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief   a victim loses all flesh on his hands  barely saying  ow  only one scene  that went on too long  was minutely tense   a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back  using a sheet  where are the mst k guys
