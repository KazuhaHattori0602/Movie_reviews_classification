if i didn t know any better  i would have thought resurrection was made in the late  s early  s  when crap sold as film in hollywood   i don t understand why people like christopher lambert  he speaks like he s reading off of cue cards and turns into a fountain whenever he has to emote  he was easily the movie s weakest aspect  the other actors were ok  nothing horrible   it s easy to see where the majority of the budget went  the special effects  the killings look pretty professional  but hardly make up for the film s dullness   i wouldn t go as far as to say resurrection is a carbon copy of se en  but it certainly bears a certain resemblance to it  centering on a religious minded murderer on a modern crusade  the detectives investigating his work have to rely on bible passages and christian history to piece together the killer s puzzle  resurrection  however  is bereft of se en s clever storytelling  cinematography  acting well  everything that makes it good  instead  resurrection lies to the audience and uses the scooby doo method of mystery to surprise it   in conclusion  resurrection was about as bad as i expected it to be  i almost feel bad for criticizing this movie since i knew it would be bad going in  but sue me
