the last sentence of this review is a major spoiler   i have enjoyed joe dante s work since piranha  he s done a great deal of different genre parodies that were both funny and honest   but this is pure crap  this is the kind of satire   in line with thank you for smoking   that is so literal and direct that it leaves nothing a  to be laughed at and b  to leave the audience to think about   it s a shame  because the plot and the material is so rich  timely and ripe for intelligent commentary   by the way  there is absolutely no reason for the main character to shoot the ann coulter character at the end of the film  it s just flat out ridiculous
