pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique    throw opaque  unstructured threads around to perplex the audience    deal only in `big  topics such as life  death and god    make it appear profound with scenes of life  death  sky  etc    depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt    and finally  laugh all the way to critical acclaim   this movie is pretentious faux intellectualism at its boldest  not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions  they re afraid to pose the questions to begin with  the film is held together by wisps  directions are raised and dropped awkwardly  pop cultural references are jolting and arbitrary  there is so little to point at  that any critical stabs will miss   critics who found an intellectual base to this movie are afraid to admit the truth  they have no idea what this movie is about  good news  neither do the filmmakers  satisfying attempts at answers to profound questions about human existence demand wit  intellect  poetry  and genius  sadly  this movie demonstrates none of these traits
