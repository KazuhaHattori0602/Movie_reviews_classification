this film and the  st avp film both all over the whole aliens and predator franchise   they are awful films  badly acted  badly scripted and terribly directed  they just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out  quality production  they came up with the predaturd   the original alien aliens predator predator   films were great  they redefined the horror thriller genre by inventing these insane  and yet still believable  creatures who took the role of the  serial killer  as opposed to a human    these films are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name   the aliens vs predator comic books were brilliant and had a great story  they were true to the alien predator mythology  didn t crap all over the original stories etc  why didn t they make the comic book into a great film  because hollywood are idiots  thats why
