i feel really bad for reviewing this movie because i wish that i had only watched it as a concept production  the covenant looked like it could have been a really original piece  but sadly they lose the great idea in the translation to the screen   the story follows four  five  teens that are the descendants of the families that started the town of ipswitch a survivors of the salem witch trials  they also happen to be a part of the secret sect called  the covenant  their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life force in small amounts and is highly addictive  in theory this would make a pretty good action sci fi movie
or at least an interesting teeny flick   but there were just too many glaring downfalls that don t allow this movie to reach its plot s full potential  that acting wasn t good  the sound track was mediocre and we found a lot of unnecessary sync issues  for sure the biggest issue is the poor editing job  the movie has little to no coherent flow and makes one fight to keep a mental timeline or any feel of pacing   the movie has it s moments  but overall was a little disappointing   a witchy
