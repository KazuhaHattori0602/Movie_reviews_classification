well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof  to summarize things up  cop dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal michael keaton   well criminal agrees but escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son   dead criminal no transplant dead son   well  the police in this movie doesn t have a brain  in case they never heard of a tazer to knock off the criminal without killing him  end of movie  as simple as that   but it when all crazy and stupid including the death of  cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly
