angel a is a change of pace for besson  monochrome  mawkish and rather mediocre  it is well photographed on location in paris  although subtitle readers should note  quick fire dialogue and good cinematography may make for frustrating viewing   this film is no  wings of desire  or  wonderful life  despite its shared themes  heavenly intervention averts suicide  angel mortal relationships ensue  besson does nothing to enlighten or inspire us  even the well acted  teary moments  rapidly descend into toe curling sentimentality   the film s flawed ideology irritates  an angel whose message of love and respect for self is constantly undermined by her own violent and promiscuous behaviour  a  happy ending  which negates the hero s supposed journey from helplessness to self esteem and independence   verdict  quite nice to look at but confused moral and philosophical messages tarnish the film precisely where it should shine
