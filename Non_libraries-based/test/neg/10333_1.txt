this movie is from the  s  but it looks like it was made in the stone age  the effects are way too cheesy  my copy has sandra bullock on the cover  which was why i bought the movie  she was in the movie for about   minutes of total screentime  she would most likely deny all involvement   in short  there is no part of this movie worth seeing  except to laugh at how bad it sucks  rent this to see the worst film ever made  bar none
