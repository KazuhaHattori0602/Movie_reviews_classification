what a sad surprise   being a die hard fan of the original series  starring don adams  i was really looking forward to this  poor fool me  this is sillier and more brain dead than a monkey s bottom   to say it was bad would be a severe understatement  it is was the worst movie  well first   minutes of one  i have seen for a long time  i couldn t stand more than the first half hour  preferring to watch my hard drive de fragment   i can tolerate bad  bad is o k  sometimes even cute  but up with contrived hollywood crap  and this has to be the worst in many years  i will not put  this movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity  my five year old daughter could have written better   and she is not even dislexic  i m really tempted to try watching the rest of it  but i m afraid i have better things to do  like making pizza dough and watching it rise   what a sad disappointment  no  i m buggered off  what a swindle  as mel brookes once said   piece of shirt
