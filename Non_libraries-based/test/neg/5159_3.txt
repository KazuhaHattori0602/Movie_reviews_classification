honestly  people who gave this movie a ten would have given   for pulp fiction  this is the level that we are dealing with here   the movie isn t bad but no way is it like  omg  the best movie since pulp fiction  some people have incredibly low expectations for movies  even those of indie variety  personally  i found my interest in the movie waned after the half hour mark  the plot defies logic and belief  you have got to hear the part about why the wife did what she did in order  to save her husband  yeah  right  i guarantee that you would walk out of the theatre thinking   hmm  now that doesn t make sense at all  this is one movie in which you really need to suspend all logic and belief   those who said that the music score is good were probably listening to their mp  players  it absolutely killed the movie in some parts   in conclusion  watch the movie only if you have nothing particular important to do  i give this a three because there is one long sex sequence in the motel which is decent
