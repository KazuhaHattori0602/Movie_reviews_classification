i was browsing through the movies on demand and saw underdog for free and it was only   minutes long so i decided to watch it  i wasn t expecting much but it exceeded my expectations of being awful  everything about the movie was cringe worthy  the dialogue was atrocious including many terrible puns  the jokes were also terrible  i found myself yelling and flipping off my television screen while i was suffering through this trash  it hit its target audience very well but i don t see how anyone else could enjoy this film  it made me very angry and nearly cry because of everything terrible this film had going for it   the only enjoyable thing about this movie was being able to give it a   after viewing it  i beg you to avoid it at all costs  i understand the fact that its made for kids but there is nothing likable about it at all
