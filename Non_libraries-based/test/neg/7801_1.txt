this one is a real stinker   the story just isn t up to par with most other tz episodes  it s pretty boring  though seeing peter falk made up as a fidel castro lookalike is kind of amusing   whenever twilight zone would be aired at an unannounced hour in my hometown  i d grab a sandwich and a drink and settle in for some quality entertainment    times out of   it wound up being this episode  strange thing  this often happened to my mom  another tz fan like me  as well  there were so many times that one of us would say to the other   i was all set to watch _the twilight zone_ and guess which episode was on  the cuban dictator episode  obviously some people like this episode  as it gets a   rating   how that happened  i have no idea   but that in and of itself would make a great twilight zone plot
