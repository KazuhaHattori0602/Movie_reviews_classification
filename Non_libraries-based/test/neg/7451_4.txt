this movie started off great  the first   minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters  that s the good news  the bad news is that the film then gets too repetitive and then it gets downright stupid    what we wind up getting is a santa claus with  magical  powers with a lot of new age baloney thrown in the mix  it s just ridiculous and hardly the kind of  christmas movie  i would expect from jim varney s  ernest   to be fair  it still had a decent amount of laughs and is profanity free but just not a film i could recommend
