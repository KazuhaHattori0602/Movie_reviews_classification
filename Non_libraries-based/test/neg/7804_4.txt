anupam kher is an excellent actor  he debuted at   playing a   yr old in saraansh  now he turns director with ojj  the film has a good plot but it s regressive  the theme has been done to death and urmila s character looks too put on while anil mahima and abhi  tara tracks are too sudden and then forgotten  the film moves a snail pace and begins to drag but there are several good scenes like the entire conflict between anil fardeen and abhishek where fardeen says to sell the house  abhishek getting caught for a crime and anil shouting at him  the climax is too much though  directorally anupam shows potential  but has some way to go music is okay  anil kapoor excels in his part like always fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs to improve abhishek is excellent  this was a turning pt  people realized he can act urmila is okay mahima and tara are wasted waheeda is good
