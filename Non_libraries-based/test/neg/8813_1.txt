this was the most unrealistic movie i ever seen   i can t believe that the writer and director didn t see that almost all the movie looks like a sf one   for example      it is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after   hours to get up so quickly     you can t get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie believe me  it s my domain     with a saw you can cut   pipes in   hour very easy  let s say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron     if you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint  in the best case  it s more likely to die because your hart fails  before to get to the bone shin   and there are more other examples
