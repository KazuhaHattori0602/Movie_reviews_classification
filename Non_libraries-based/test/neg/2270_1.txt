the comparisons between the   version and this are inevitable  sadly  this version falls far short   the casting is uninspired and the acting wooden  one gets the impression the director did not read the book so did not understand the characters   sir walter elliot is portrayed as pompous but his inadvertent silliness which redgrave brilliantly captured  in the   version  is nowhere to be found   the musgrove sisters are so unlikable  one doesn t understand why wentworth or anybody else would give them a second glance   the relationship between wentworth and anne is devoid of feeling   in the   version  hinds and root managed to convey the depth of emotion the two of them felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions  in this one  it is hard to understand anne spent years mired in regret unless one has read the book   this production does not capture the emotional complexity of the main characters  relationship   in the scene where wentworth walks in on anne and mary having breakfast  it seems to the viewer  as mary thinks  they are only slight acquaintances   in the   version  when wentworth walks in  the first time he sees her in years  the tension is thick  resentment is coming off wentworth in waves  while anne is almost overcome   in this version  while wentworth is courting lousia  it is as if he is truly invested  the undercurrents are missing  in the   version  the viewer sees wentworth s anger at anne  he is flaunting his courtship in front of anne  as if to say   see what you gave up  i don t need or want you anymore   yet he still cares if she suffers  as the scene where he asks his sister and the admiral to take anne back to house illustrates  in the   version the viewer feels anne s shock that he would care if she was tired  we also feel wentworth s discomfort that he does still care  in this version he just walks on with lousia as if nothing happened   the pivotal scene where anne is conversing with harville about who loves longest  man or woman  is totally botched  the actors are just reciting lines with no emotional investment   when anne reads the letter from wentworth  it is as if she is reading a grocery list   contrast this to the   version  where the viewer feels anne s joy at her second chance  we are there with her as she reads the letter  the director had both actors reading the letter and you hear both their voices  wentworth is full of frustration  passion and hope  while anne s is at first incredulous then evolves in to joy   this production has more scenes after the revelation  probably because it was needed to explain to the viewer what just happened  the   version didn t need to explain  we knew and rejoiced for the characters the only thing this production has in it s favor is it kept the mrs  smith sub plot intact  while the   version did not   the   version however did include part of austen s original ending  the scene where wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if anne and mr  elliot will want to move back to her house  which he   mrs  croft are renting  after they marry    this is a production to avoid at all costs
