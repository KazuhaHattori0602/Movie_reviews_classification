as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing  this is  not    a film   cue dramatic music    it s just a so bad it s good  totally surreal  jackie chan stunt for all  the women fighters are totally kick butt and jackie is definitely put in his place    this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon   surrounded by munchies  ready to roar with laughter  cheer on the good guys  boo the bad guys  and continually yell   what  when something totally bizarre happens  great fun
