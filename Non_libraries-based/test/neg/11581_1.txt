i can admit right away that this is one of the worst movies i have seen in my life  and that is not saying a little  because i consider myself to be somewhat of an aficionado when it comes to crappy film  but this is beyond bad  this movie is so awful that there is no fun left in it  it s just bad   reviewing this is almost impossible  there are no strong points and nothing positive to say  i ll just ramble about a few of the points that sucked  first off  the cgi has to be one of the worst i ve seen  i can t believe this movie was made in   the cgi reminds me of something i might have seen in babylon   way back when cgi was new and fresh  it s poor beyond belief  second  the actors all seem like they belong in the worst kind of daytime soaps  and looking at their resumes i see that i m correct  thirdly  being able to breed enormous reptiles is no match to the other technology they invented in this movie  the recoilless pistol with infinite ammo  seriously  michael par  fires   times without reloading in every other scene  as if that was not enough there are also shape shifting planes  at first they are regular f  fighters  in the next scene they are something else completely  and in the third scene they are f  again  if you re buying stock footage  please don t mix it like this    honestly  there is loads more to say  but i think i ll stop  you all understand what i m saying  honestly i didn t think this kind of movie was made any more  it s like something ed wood would do  completely ignorant of quality  not caring how anything looks  it s almost amazing in all it s awfulness  if i could give it   i would  but   is the lowest grade  so that s it
