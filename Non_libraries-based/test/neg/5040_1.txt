i will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines  i ll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation  over acting  obvious tag lines
 these are some of it s good qualities  if you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to civilization you got is this movie throw it to the fish  i can t tell you how much i m sorry i saw this horrifying ghastly movie  speaking of which  this movie supposedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is the playing capabilities of some of the actors   take care
