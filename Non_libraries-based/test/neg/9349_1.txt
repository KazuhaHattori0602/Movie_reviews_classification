i like the  star wars  series  i like a good  cheapo sci fi flick every once in a while  too  heck  i even like the roger corman produced nickel and dime jobbies   i do not like  the ice pirates  though    for one  it just looks too cheap  you know  for a movie that s supposed to take place in outer space  it feels cramped and closed in like it s being filmed in the front seat of someone s mazda  and the special effects  while appropriately cheesy  look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray   usually  i don t let things like that bother me  especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile   they ain t   the whole storyline  about these ne er do well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water  a hot commodity in the future  i guess  is about as original as the jokes  which is not a compliment   the humor comes in at about crotch level  like that castrating machine you ll see early on  and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude  and who told john matuzak that he was funny  whoever did  shame on them  good old robert urich tries  but he s a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship  or starship  in this case    i watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time   shanghaied   no stars  in spite of of the presence of huston  one year prior to  prizzi s honor  and carradine  at the tail end of a once lofty career  these  pirates  should walk the plank
