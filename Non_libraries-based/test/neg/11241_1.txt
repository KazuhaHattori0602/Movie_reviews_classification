the first time i saw this was when i was with a date  and she thought it was an awesome movie  i didn t   the second time i saw this was last night on tv  it still sucks   as a love story this sucks  as having julia portray a street hooker  this is repulsive  to me she was a librarian with a miniskirt and heels  she had no tough shell to her  she wasn t tortured  anguished  enraged  starving or anything else  her  hooker  character was so flawed  like comparing a cubic zircon to a diamond  the two simply don t fit  no matter what they look like   the only cast i felt was worth watching was the   bitchy saleswomen  whom were excellently cast  they did such a fine job that i hated them for the few seconds that they were on screen  they had real definition  for the minor roles  ok  so the movie wasn t entirely trash the two ignorant saleswomen saved the film   aside from those two women sales people  the rest of the cast including the big names was just crap  either everybody was an ass kisser or had absolutely no reason to fill any dialog in the movie aside from just complimenting julia roberts or kissing ass to richard gere   this was a movie about how when you walk around in high heels and a tight skirt in beverly hills  people leer at you and guys who work in hotels gawk as if they just had a baseball bat struck to their face   while in reality  the women who are dressed to the nines in beverly hills are hookers and prostitutes to a higher degree  but since they aren t wearing the gaudy madonna looking jewelry or the patent boots  they can look down on the others who do   the hotel cast was sickeningly sad to watch  and anybody who had any real character had less than a minute of screen time   this is an insult to romantic movies  comedies  dramas and even to prostitutes who face wealthy customers on a daily basis with hopes of having their lives work out perfect   the story is about julia roberts being pimped  yes pimped  by a multimillionaire in a business suit and limousine   she is still owned  still told how to act  how to move  what to wear  what to say  where to go and what to do  he is more controlling than a street pimp  but the folks at disney buena vista butter it up to make it easier to swallow   had richard gere been a black man with a gold tooth and an ak  at his side instead of an attach  case  this movie would be about how a woman has to struggle to get away from the harshness of prostitution  same story  different characters will make a very different outlook   oh yeah  change the white man for a black man or asian or spanish  have the land business deal be changed to a deal of weapons or narcotics and the entire concept of romantic comedy is thrown away   as far as i m concerned  pretty woman is still trash  dressed with ribbons and bows   i didn t like it   years ago  when i didn t understand it and was led by the hollywood hype  i hate it now that i can see past the pretty decorations that is called  love   this movie is not a romantic comedy  it s a story on how to control a woman as long as you have the means and income to do so   this is an insult to strong women  weak women and women in general  as well as to my television screen   do i hate it  yes  does it suck  yes would i recommend it to you  no well maybe if i really hated you   will this review get posted  we ll see   anywayz  that s all for now
