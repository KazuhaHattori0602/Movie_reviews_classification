the plot was not good   the special effects weren t   the acting was  not very good at all   like others  i felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly  well  a space shuttle through   i thought the ending was rather unbelievable   by the way guys  about the  blow torch in space   blow torches have their own supply of oxygen  hence the name  oxy acetylene torch  two hoses run from the torch  one to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle   so a  blow torch  would work just fine in space
