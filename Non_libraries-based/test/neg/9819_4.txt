disappointing film with walter pidgeon as a hunter who goes to germany to assassinate hitler  when he is discovered  he is coerced into signing a document stating that he acted on orders from england  his refusal to sign the document brings us to the plot of the film   pidgeon is pursued back to england by the evil george sanders and his cohort  john carradine  who speaks little  but is again as always  the embodiment of wickedness personified   along the way of being pursued  pidgeon meets up with joan bennett  the latter displaying a wonderful cockney accent   the story gets bogged down somewhat as love develops between the two  but again as we approach world war   realism becomes the object of the day   the near ending scene in the cave between sanders and pidgeon is nicely realized but we know where that arrow is going to go to   very interesting that while pidgeon is fleeing nazi germany  he meets up again with a young roddy mcdowall  one of pidgeon s many co stars that same year in the memorable  how green was my valley  how green was  man hunt
