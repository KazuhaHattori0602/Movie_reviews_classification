i had high hopes for this movie i even gave up a night of watching stargate for this movie  i found it had a rushed feel about it and a lot of the key biblical moments and facts were missing  i might be a bit jaded and spoiled for the   version  as i have watched that one every year for the last   or so years  i doubt this one will make it to the realm of yearly classic  as the other one has  if you have not seen the   version  you might like this one but  i seriously doubt it and urge you to skip this one and go rent or buy the classic one  this has some nifty special effects but that is not what i look for when telling a movie like the ten commandments  i was kind of looking to see how they told the story  and the writers did not do a good job with this one
