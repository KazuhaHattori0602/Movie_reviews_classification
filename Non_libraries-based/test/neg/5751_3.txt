at the beginning of  loggerheads  we re introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters  to make matters even more confusing  we re informed  via titles on the screen  that the action is taking place in three separate time lines  between the years   and   it takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related  mark austin  a young man in his  s  gay and hiv positive is estranged from his conservative parents  elizabeth and rev  robert austin    mark is now a drifter and arrives in kure beach  north carolina  a seaside town  where he meets george  sensitively played by michael kelly  a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other  meanwhile  mark s birth mother  grace  played by bonnie hunt  has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was   similarly  mark s adoptive mother  also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him  despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband    loggerheads  we re told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its achilles heel  director writer tim kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found  take mark and george they re both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about  there s some slight tension when grace faces off against an adoption agency director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager  no sparks fly either between elizabeth and robert since the good reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son     loggerheads  is similar to  brokeback mountain  in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males  for example  the kure beach cop and the reverend  are the baddies  the biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction  and hence no dramatic conflict  between mark and either one of his  mothers  mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him    kirkman s theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it s too late  kirkman s sentiments are for the most part well intentioned but they do not make for good drama  loggerheads moves along at a snail s pace without providing any new revelations  or suspense  regarding such topics as aids  adoption and homophobia  ultimately  loggerheads  fails due to a lack of originality
