worst film ever nothing more needs to be said  aaron carter is utterly repellent and the rest of the cast should fire their agents immediately  it really is a terrible terrible movie from beginning to end  i wish i could be more eloquent in describing the movies many  oh so many  flaws however i cant be bothered get too angry to form proper sentences    in short i absolutely hated everything about this movie and not in  so bad its good  kinda way   it was unadulterated drek   gavin
