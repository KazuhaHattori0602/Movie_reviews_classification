i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews    please  a boy meets girl next door at   and both aspire to love and being basketball legends  grow apart  but watch each others progress  guess what  both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman  our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies  and guess what is picked up by lakers  dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period  so for   years they go their own way  she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks  mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout  he wins he marries she wins he loves her  well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl  the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties  sorry   is my high score  my partner she scored   for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon
