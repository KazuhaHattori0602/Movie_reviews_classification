this has got to be the worst steven segal movie i have ever watched  even worse than eco piffle like on deadly ground   fire down below  i ll start with the good points  it s got stylish direction for a dtv movie and has wonderful scenry  that s it  the story dosen t really go anywhere  it s just an array of well staged set pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys  the body count can easily match tarantino at his bloodiest  the plot is needlessly complicated and confusing you forget who the good and bad guys are  the acting  i use the term loosely  is mediocre at best  seagal s usual one constipated expression and wooden acting i can take but the others especially the brits were down right terrible   what s in the package  why are bad guys after it  is seagal being set up   who gives a s   when i rented this movie at my local blockbuster  once i d paid  the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the shop i could have picked   i felt like punching him till my arm went numb   anyway  i haven t seen half past dead or out for a kill yet and i daren t go back for more humiliation at my store  but they can t be anyworse than this turkey  the soundtrack is supposed to be young and hip   it just gave me a suuden urge for half a dozen asprins   all in all this is seagal at his worst  the guy who s gained about  ibs and looks well past it  he s a guy who just doesn t no when to stop  he should retire gracefully now  and have a go behind the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something   my rating     point for scenery
