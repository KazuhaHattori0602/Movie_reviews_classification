a group of adventurers travel to the  dark continent  to try and locate a lost heiress named diana  who disappeared years before in a plane crash  and who is now believed to be living with a savage tribe that consider her to be their goddess   once again  my search for sleazy  european cannibal movies has taken me deep into jess franco territory a seemingly endless cinematic wilderness swarming with sub par scriptwriting  crawling with crap camera work  and abundant with awful acting  franco regular lina romay taking the prize this time for her pitiful performance as an ailing  elderly woman  it is here  in this hellish place  that i finally stumbled upon diamonds of kilimanjaro  an abysmal jungle based exploitationer so stupefyingly bad that it took me three successive evenings to finish watching it   tawdry and unrelentingly dull  even by franco s standards  this wearisome piece of trash fails on almost every level  the story is a dreadfully dull derivative of edgar rice burrough s tarzan  albeit with a feminine twist  the film appears to have been filmed in the local botanical gardens  although grainy stock footage is poorly integrated into the film in a pointless effort to convince viewers that the action is really taking place in africa  and the death scenes are virtually bloodless  franco can usually be relied upon for some splatter  but despite initial appearances  this isn t a cannibal movie and it isn t that gory   where the director does succeed  however  is in his casting of sexy young katja bienert as jungle jail bait diana  running and leaping through the undergrowth in nothing but a skimpy loin cloth  her curvaceous bod belying the fact that she was only sixteen at the time  this nubile beauty makes quite an impression  franco also throws in some further nudity courtesy of mari carmen nieto as treacherous traveller lita  who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions  and aline mess as topless warrior woman noba  thus narrowly avoiding getting yet another rating of   from me  although i m sure he ll be receiving plenty more in the future i have loads of his films yet to see
