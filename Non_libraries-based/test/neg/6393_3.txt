yeah  i know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place  it s hilarious   if you want some accuracy  this is not a movie to rely on  it starts with the flight from s o paulo to rio aboard a   this will never happen on the   km flight  smaller planes such as   or a  shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour  the drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth  perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists  not that it would be a local habit as i myself got ripped off in very serious places such as switzerland  the girls  yes  all topless  that s something an outsider will never understand  brazilian chicks will be happy to expose     of their incredible bodies at the samba schools parades and wear almost non existent bikinis at beach  but never go topless  a handful beaches across the whole country will allow it  all carefully secluded and out of town  oh  the indoor decoration  the amazing wallpaper  maybe in disneyworld  apart from that  it is very entertaining and  yes  demi moore is absolutely splendid
