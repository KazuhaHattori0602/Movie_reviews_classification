i m surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie  even my   and   year old were bored  the chipmunks are cute but the storyline is overly obvious  not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes   we did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance  but i wondered why   i don t admit to ever being a  chipmunks  fan  but i expected to be entertained  it s not even an  escapist  movie as far as i can tell  simply a heavy handed view of  success too young spoils  we ve seen more than enough of that with britney spears  et al  haven t we   don t bother
