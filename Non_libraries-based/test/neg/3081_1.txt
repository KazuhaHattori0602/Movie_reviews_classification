    what was john stewart doing in this film  that was yet again another moment when my eyes were opened just for a moment in one of those battles that seemed to last forever   and frankly  it s heather graham   we could care less about her after a while  she s just not interesting   she s just bland  boring and basically stops acting after a while  while they desperately start throwing wacky characters into the mix to revive the movie  it just doesn t work and instead of just calling it a day   they start throwing more characters into the mix so now it s just weird  tedious  boring and really  really long  luke wilson s slow drawl acting style slows an already crawling movie to dead halt   why exactly were these two married  committed is a truly terrible film the kind of  hip comedy  that leaves you staggering out depressed and bored   grade    out of
