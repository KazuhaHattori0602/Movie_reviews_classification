i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out  it didn t bother me that lost world wasn t as intellectual as the original  and here  i was just hoping for a good monster movie  it was all about  dinosaurs eat people  however  it was disappointing even on that level   for starters  there were not enough people to eat  and while i ll keep it a secret how many people get eaten  it was not enough  also  while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community  there were not nearly  enough  dinosaurs  and many dinosaurs  like the spikey back and has a club on its tail osaurus  just made cameos and didn t do much considering how cool they are    start spoilers  then there were the pterodactyls  the figures i ve read put their body weight at about   pounds  while the movie made them look closer to   worse  they didn t get to eat anybody  or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up  there was no ending to the movie  either  it was just  all of the sudden  credits   end spoilers  i m left wondering if the edition i saw was missing   minutes of film   my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your   go rent the carnosaur series  at least you won t be disappointed
