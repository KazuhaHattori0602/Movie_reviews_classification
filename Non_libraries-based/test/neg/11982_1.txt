barely came trough the whole movie  acting is bad  dialogs are even worse  felt kinda st pid   watching it  but it was named the same as one of my favorite games  so i struggled trough  they even screwed up the sound  at certain parts of the movie the background music is so loud  that i had to turn the volume down  it would be great  if this was a competition about who can screw up more   oh and ps  i don t know what s this guy  uwe  capable of creating  i certainly don t think this movie is bad just because he s the director  i checked the list of his work  and this is his first and probably the last  creation that i ve seen   over out
