this movie was unbelievably bad  it s gory but the violence is just too much to the point where it looks extremely fake and predictable  since everything is shown to you there is nothing left to the imagination  and the plot  what plot  there really isn t any  the pacing is unbelievably slow  despite the random acts of violence  and the screenplay must have been written by a deranged   year old kid who kills kittens for fun  so this movie was banned in   countries  i could see why  not because of the gore  boring and trite  but because it was a terrible movie  it should have been banned from existence  avoid this one like the plague    out of
