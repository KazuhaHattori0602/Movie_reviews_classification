according to the blurb on the back of the dvd case  jonothan ross  laughed until a little bit of wee came out  i suspect that that has more to do with his being full of it   i never watched the series for one reason or another  so maybe i m missing some essential cues  as to this movie  i watched the first   minutes or so  i laughed once  smiled once  then reached for the newspaper whilst waiting for something else entertaining to happen  nothing did   evidently intended to be a surreal spoof upon life in the post python  gross humour style  this one falls absolutely flat  there s been a host of comedy series on television in the last few years  not the least of which were  bottom   the fast show   the vicar of dibley  and  father ted  each one engaging a group of bizarre but hilarious characters and sketches  any one of these could knock this crap into a cocked hat   if the series was anything like this movie  i m surprised they got the funding  happily it was one of those   tesco bran tub purchases and is now in the local charity shop   the moral of the story is  don t believe the pundits  never pay top dollar
