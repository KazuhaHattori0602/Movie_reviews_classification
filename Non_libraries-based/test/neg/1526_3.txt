a modern scare film  yep it is   the hippies  peaceniks and environmentalists got together to deliver us a fear film  i didn t recognize it when watching it only   years ago that it was a fear film but that s exactly what it is   there s no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww  and the same films we made about them  this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those  that believe in aliens    conspiracy plots  faked moon landings  peak oil and major environmentalism what i can say is this film does push buttons  make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it  it s a scare film  so if your scarred get in your houses  lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush provokes the chinese into nuclear war
