this movie includes   well known actors i have previously enjoyed watching  there actions are great and each action is heart felt  but it makes me think these   were thrown into a speech drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind humping to drive the audience into tears for her release   the only good part is the acting abilities  the plot has the same ruse as hitlers influence and i started to hate the protagonist for that  but all of this could have been done within   minutes in my opinion  so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it
