soultaker was written by and starred vivian schilling  it also starred joe estevez  gregg thomsen  and robert d zar as the angel of death   the story begins with introduction to soultaker  played by joe estevez  we quickly learn what soultaker s role will be in this movie   next the college aged young people are getting ready for a summer festival  aptly named  summerfest  in this film  the battle of the classes is omni present throughout the film  the girls come from a wealthy class  and the guys come from roughly middle or lower class  the class roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason which isn t really clear or pertinent to the story   at summerfest we learn more about the apparent class struggles of why zach isn t encouraged to date natalie  soultaker makes an appearance as well  with apparently his boss the angel of death  here d zar s character points out who is to die and who s souls are to be taken  it s revealed as well  that soultaker will have a character conflict regarding natalie  and how he deals with her because of someone in his past   meanwhile natalie is ditched by her ride to summerfest  and zach convinces her to ride home with them  during the ride home  soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck horribly at high speeds   the rest of the story surrounds the soultaker collecting the souls of the dead passengers  and zach and natalie trying to outwit him to return to their bodies so they can continue to live  the class and character conflicts lay in the story  but are really never brought to the forefront or resolved   there s an attempt towards the end to drag out some of the drama  there s a lot of chasing and running which does tend to be really boring  it s not really acceptable  and it would ve been nice had this been dealt with differently  somehow to maybe increase the drama but not bore the audience   the story and acting are decent  the soundtrack is ok  and even the production values are good   robert d zar in his brief on screen appearances does a nice job as the angel of death  joe estevez does ok  however sometimes his role acting a bit flat  vivian is pretty and does a decent job as natalie  although perhaps over acting a bit in a few scenes   this may sound odd  but this movie definitely could ve benefited from some pointless nudity  vivian teases us a bit but that wasn t enough   in my opinion this was a pretty serious attempt at making a movie  the results  it s worth watching  just don t expect a perfect production
