why do i hate this  let me list the ways   i have nothing against mary pickford but a   year old woman playing a   year old is just stupid   there s a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it s considered funny and it goes on for   minutes   strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt  the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs  for a  family  film the fights were way too violent  loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy  and the humor was just stupid   seriously    minutes in i gave up and turned it off  the slurs  racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me  also there was no plot that i could see  the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era   just painful  avoid
