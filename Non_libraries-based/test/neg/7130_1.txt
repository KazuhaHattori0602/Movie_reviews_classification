this  remake  is a complete disgrace  so mediocre  cheap and prosaic  it wouldn t deserve more than a couple of spiteful lines   it s also a cheat  with a laughable script served by such contrived and amateurish  acting  you re always aware there s a set  a camera  a fake  no direction  no suspended reality whatsoever to allow you delve into the story   the claustrophobic  stifling tension of the small spaces and rooms in the original japanese masterpieces  ju on       is all but lost here in overblown sets and spaces   but worst of all  the moral enormity and unbearable suffering  which both imparted a ruthless logic to the original mother and child victims turned into relentlessly vindictive ghouls  is completely ruined by utter nonsense and hollow boogie man style scares   if american audiences aren t willing to read subtitles and rise above the lowest common denominator  preferring to swallow this kind of patronizing hogwash instead  they fully deserve this pathetic curse  the movie itself
