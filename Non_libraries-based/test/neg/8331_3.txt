the world now seems to be in an odd stage of downsizing  in which objects such as dvd and cd players are steadily decreasing in size  it is obviously much cooler to have a smaller ipod than a larger one  this is not so with theater screens  as is the case with the imax  the enormous  widely known theater system that has stunned audiences upon its release  and to this day  as long as the material s right   the main problem with  magnificent desolation  walking on the moon  d  is that it uses the huge screen as its main advantage  it is dull  uninformative  and relentlessly eager to please and amaze us with its corny special effects and inspiring quotes from famous names such as neil armstrong and buzz aldrin  another problem with the film is that it doesn t even take the time to sit down and interview those lucky few who have had such an extraordinary experience as to have been to the moon  instead  the writers have simply pressed copy and paste and hired famous voices such as morgan freeman  bill paxton  and matt damon to imitate their famous quotes  this tactic is unrelentingly repetitive and tedious   i d say without one moment s hesitation that i didn t learn one piece of information from the film that i didn t already know   and it repeatedly insisted on irritating the crap out of me with its insistent sentimentality  every three minutes there seems to be a cue for tom hanks  voice to say something like  without the contributions of these brave men and women  watching the film is like watching a bad commercial  for forty agonizing minutes
