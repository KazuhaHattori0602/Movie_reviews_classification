this is one of the stupidest movies ever  not the stupidest mind you but one of the stupidest  this is     minutes of sleep inducing material  probably jim varney s worst movie ever  the last   seconds of the film is the best and funniest part but hardly worth sitting through the whole movie for  on the other hand  if you are a die hard jim varney ernest fan  then like me  you must add this film to your collection  it does have brief  rare moments of humor  although they are few and far between  the mere fact that this movie is so hard to find makes it a collectors item and a must have for your ernest collection  i was lucky to find this film online at a dirt cheap price a couple years ago  i believe i paid   plus shipping for it  and it was the only copy i could find anywhere  even though this is a truly all around horrible movie  it is still a must have if you are a jim varney fan and an ernest movie collector such as i  on a scale of   to   i give this movie a   but thats only because i ve never seen a   before
