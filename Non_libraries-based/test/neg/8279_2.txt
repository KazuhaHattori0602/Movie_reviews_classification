 graduation day      i bought this movie this past week and waited for some time where i could kick back and relax and watch some  good   s slasher gems  i got this and  xtro  to watch  never seen any of them  i just watched it and realized my outdoor speakers were on also  i only imagine what my neighbors thought when  felony  came on to sing their one   minute hit  i m sure it was loud and i m sure they think i m weird  with that and the chainsaw sound and screaming from other movies   this was a pretty sub par slasher movie  no suspense  no story  some cool deaths  almost seemed on the amateur side  i usually like movies like that  but it just didn t click with me  now i will watch  xtro  for the  st time and have a margarita   dj eric austin tx
