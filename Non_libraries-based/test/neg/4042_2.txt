words cannot express how poor this film is   there is no plot  the acting is appalling  basically the whole film is a joke   with a running time of   minutes  it s about   minutes too long   it might have been ok as a short sketch on a comedy show  but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in   avoid this one  go rent a good movie instead
