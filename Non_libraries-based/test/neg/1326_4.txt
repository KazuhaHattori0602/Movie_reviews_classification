do people rate this movie highly because it s a foreign war movie   to me it s nothing more than a bad hollywood war movie in german   this movie is so bad on so many levels  to even mention it along with platoon or full metal jacket is absurd  the battle sequences are pathetic  the dialog and acting atrocious   this so called group of  storm troopers  are regulars in the wermacht  not ss troops  there is so much wrong with this movie it s sad  bad editing  bad acting  it s got it all   the movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did   i read in a review that the this film had a   million budget   for real  where was it spent  in the fake train car sequences  in the pathetic  special effects  ugh   as a wwii history buff  and wwii movie fan  i found this movie to be a serious disappointment   for an excellent alternative war movie check out  the beast   not a wwii movie  but still outstanding   don t bother with this one
