without john rhys davies  i have to admit that this would never even register on my movie meter  but in spite of that single fact  this is not a bad little thriller  considering the low budget  the low quality effects  the stiff acting and the sci fi channel aspects  the blood effects are very convincing  and the chupacabra actually looks realistic  regardless of what you think a chupacabra looks like this is one good looking chupacabra   aside from the positives  this runs kind of like kolchak  the night stalker  darren mcgavin  remember  meets the love boat  but in spite of the ultimate cheese of this work  it still holds something resembling a plot  and actually attempts to gain your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes   as conflicted as this work is  i still managed to find some enjoyment herein  maybe you will  too   it rates a   on the made   tv scale   it rates a   on the movie scale from   the fiend
