this is an awful movie from just about every point of view  since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews  let me just focus on  serbs  and  delta force  guys in this movie     the uniforms that  serbs  wear are not serbian  and helmets are wrong  too     the actors who play  serbs  are not speaking serbian  not even a language close to serbian  unlike in  behind enemy lines  where the czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie     the gray bearded  serbian general  looks and acts like a moron  firing his gun whenever us soldiers call his name      us soldier   gravic  give up     gray bearded moronic general   fires his ak     us soldier   gravic  come out     gbmg   fires his ak     us soldier   gravic  you re surrounded     gbmg   fires his ak     prop guy   excuse me  mr  gray bearded moronic general  see  we re out of blanks and i sent the boy to buy some more  but he s not back yet     gbmg   click     since when does the army issue ak s to the delta force  i guess they couldn t find enough working m s in bulgaria  but there were plenty of old ak s and practice blanks   maybe they should have went for some airsofts  they are cheaper and wouldn t have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway     in the scene where a df officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist  he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time  no sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that  i guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way    this movie is such an insult to common sense
