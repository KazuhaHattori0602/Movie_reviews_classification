i saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago  and fuzzy recollection suggests that i liked it  however  seeing it for a second time two things stand out    very poor acting on the part of michelle johnson  and   very poor music throughout   it s not that all the music was bad  some of the brazilian music was fine  but the theme song and others that clanged their way in were reminiscent of the worst of  s pop music   johnson s voice seemed all wrong  possibly dubbed  this was distracting   on the positive side    the story s not bad    it s interesting seeing such a young demi moore    valerie harper never looked better  and   johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of disattire
