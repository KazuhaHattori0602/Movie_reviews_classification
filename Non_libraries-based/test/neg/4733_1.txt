where to start  i think only three other films have led me to post a review on imdb  and all of those were positive  as for this   mind blowingly  hideously  tragically  embarrassingly  catastrophically  stupidly  irritatingly  completely and utterly beyond awful   i am stunned this got made  never mind given a theatrical release  i think i am literally in shock   i m no  snob  i didn t expect beautiful film making or intense character depth  but this is truly beyond a joke  we simply must demand more from the films we see   avoid  like the black death
