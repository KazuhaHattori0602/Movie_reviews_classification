i ve seen all   now  i just can t believe how bad naqoyqatsi is  not in comparison to the others  but simply on it s own merit  or lack of    i can t understand how the average rating for this movie is over   out of   i gave the first   movies   out of   they were thought provoking and beautifully done  i gave this movie a rating of   if a   or negative number was available  i would have given it that rating instead  what a total waste of time it was watching this movie  i thought after the first   minutes that i should turn it off  but then i figured that it was just a  very  slow starting movie  i thought the same thing after   minutes  then   hour  etc  then i realized that it wasn t going to get any better   it s very tedious to watch and without any redeeming qualities  don t take my word for it  watch it yourself  be sure to see the first two movies before this one  if you see this one first  i can just about guarantee that you ll never want to see the first two  but they are definitely much  much better than this  piece of work   the best part of the movie is when the credits role at the end  that s when your penance on this earth is complete and you can foregoe   minutes in purgatory  for the suffering that you ve endured watching this  film  if god is truely merciful  he ll be more generous
