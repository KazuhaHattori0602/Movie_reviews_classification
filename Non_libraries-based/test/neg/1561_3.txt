edge vs  michaels boring in general  loved the sweet chin music into the chair    taker vs  heidenreich one of the worst matches i ve seen  predictable as hell   tripe threat wwe match why do i watch them  nobody ever wins a championship at the rumble  its not the main event  liked it when show drove jbl through the wall    world heavyweight championship pretty ok match  kind of more a beat down by tripe h than a match  but i was happy to see it after watching crap    royal rumble good rumble liked the brand showdown the hassan thing  and the end    overall still crap  why does anyone watch the rumble
