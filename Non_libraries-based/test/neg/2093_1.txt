i can t believe that anyone would green light this let alone voluntarily star in it  i will never be able to get that   mins of my life back   this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen  some films are so bad they re good  this has gone so far round again that s somehow it s so bad it s terrible  i was not exactly expecting much  it being a low budget  bandwagon jumping  rehash of a b movie  but it still came in way under my expectation levels  even tv movies have higher production values   there were  very  poor special effects  shocking dialogue  terrible acting and a completely unexplained plot  who cursed her and why  why did the   inch snakes turn into   foot snakes  has anyone ever heard of highly venomous garter snakes or pythons    passengers    snakes  so many promises  none delivered    some comments would have you believe that this film is worth watching for the last five minutes  it s not even worth a rental  stay in and watch a low budget tv movie  you ll enjoy it a lot more    why was this made  oh yes  to shamelessly cash in on the internet phenomenon that is soap  shame on you mallachi brothers  shame on you
