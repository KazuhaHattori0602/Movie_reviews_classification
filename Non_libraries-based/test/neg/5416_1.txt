this was so bad  i want god to give me an extra two hours of life having had to sit through it   first off  the acting was uniformly bad  there was barely a plot  unless  shaggy dog story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog  counts   the editing was was all over the place  and the slow mo shots of the  gore   red corn syrup flying through the air doubtless flung using a spoon  got irritating after the tenth time  and infuriating after the hundredth time   i like michael rooker  he s done some good work  this was not good  this was less than good  and by that  i mean that it sucked  hard   for god s sake  don t watch this movie
