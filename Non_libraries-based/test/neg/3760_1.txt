to call  rocketship x m  a science fiction classic is due more to its release date   its savvy ability to capitalize on the publicity for  destination moon  and the appearance of actors who would later star in television as sea hunt s mike nelson  rockford s dad and wyatt earp   the movie itself is bad enough to be good fodder for mst k and is best viewed with commentary from joel and the robots  this is the type of movie best suited to added riffing from the mst k characters  something preachy  slow paced  poorly scripted  and full of painfully bad acting  while unintentionally funny stuff like  plan   from outer space  don t lend themselves to satirical commentary  because the movie constantly upstages the hosts  really bad and dull movies like  rocketship x m  are ideal  so add some stars to the rating if you are watching the mst k version   the basic story has the crew taking an unplanned right turn at the moon and ending up on mars  what they find on that planet are the remnants of a human like civilization devastated by an atomic war  only one martian is shown in close up  a normal looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes  the men look like the  goons  in the old popeye cartoons  they scamper agilely around the cliffs and throw boulders at the crew with amazing accuracy especially if they are supposed to be blind  of course none of this is ever explained as doing so would require some sign of logical analysis from the writers of the screenplay   the scenes on mars are presented in something called  sepia color  to distinguish them from the rest of the b w movie  if this has you thinking  wizard of oz  you will be disappointed because it is just black and white stuff with a slight brown tint added to the print in post production   in keeping with the moronic sexism of the movie  the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations both coming and going  her failure to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface and she and mike nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their doom  insert sound of gagging here   the real stars of the movie are the reporters at the command center  so much so that mst k was inspired to specially salute these unheralded heroes  the intrepid squad of  newsies  are featured for the first   minutes of the movie  then take stations about   inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center  later they are called upon to ask the moronic questions needed by the mission director to expound on the movie s already too obvious message   the dvd has an extremely low audio level  is not captioned  and is accompanied by a trailer  although you will be thankful that it is only   minutes  it is still about   minutes too long as any   minute episode of  the twilight zone  has several times more content than this entire movie   then again  what do i know  i m only a child
