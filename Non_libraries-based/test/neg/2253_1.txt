previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies  this one is from a guy in love with his own writing  it isn t inglorious  its disgusting   i absolutely hated inglorious basterds  the entire point of a film is to entertain   if u call bashing people s heads and removing their scalps entertaining    and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit  it is extreme boredom or disgust   the movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring and disgusting scenes of people talking at tables in various languages  there is even one scene where   people talk for nearly   minutes at the same table  before  thankfully they are all shot  i wished they would have been killed off after   minutes  even woody allen knows when to shut the f k up   this table talk style is a tarantino hallmark  but in other films  i actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking  here  i couldn t care less  all of quentin s films display an enormous confidence  particularly jackie brown  but here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene  tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film   is it violent  sure there s torture and scalping galore  but you d have to remind me  thankfully  the film was so thin  i didn t even remember i had seen it earlier in the day when until i saw a review headline on msnbc   he s out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel  but do us a favor qt and spare us the movie   i walked out of this movie halfway through and i would never recommend anyone seeing it no matter what a die hard quarantino fan he or she is   i give it
