worst movie ever  its not clever or funny or thought provoking    minutes of bad actors doing their best with an awful script   acting was so bad that you can see the dead people breathing   maybe the writer director combination believed they were quentin tarantino or something  you know make a movie about nothing still cool  but failed miserably   i hope the writer never makes another movie ever  not everyone is born a writer  sometimes we need to count our losses and go back to being a bathroom attendant or whatever   please don t watch this movie  even on mute with the stereo going its still a painful   mins
