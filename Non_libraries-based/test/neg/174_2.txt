i ve heard people compare this movie to sideways  how this comparison was made  i ll never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to sideways   these   films were as different as star wars and the thornbirds  the only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subject   though the interviews in this documentary were semi interesting  they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work ever attempted  i ve never seen worse camera work in my life and i m comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by   year olds   i give this two stars  only for the interesting interviews with french wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the american wine companies are  aren t all companies pushy and corrupt  i d give it   stars  yes  that s negative   for the deplorable  terrible  horrible  awful  vertigo inducing   year old could do better camera mess
