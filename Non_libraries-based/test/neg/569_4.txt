i liked most of the dialogue  i liked the cast  i thought it was well acted  i particularly enjoyed ellen degeneres  perfect deadpan performance   what didn t work for me was    the drawn out affair with the younger man  too long  too seemingly out of character for helen    the seemingly endless cinematic cliches  mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re readings of the love letter itself  its contents should have a mystery    a young woman feminist scholar and  ironically  a fireworks scene  no wonder this reminded me of that horrid how to make an american quilt movie    the bumbling  gotcha  cop who smells  dope  everywhere  no cliche there either  and   a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting   i would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of  or even glorify  helen s bitterness  to have included much more of degeneres  character  to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices  and to be a little less uncritical of small town life   had it been developed as a play first  those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film  which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre
