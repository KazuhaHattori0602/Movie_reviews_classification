anyone remember the first cky  cky k etc  back when it was about making crazy cool stuff  rather than watching bam margera act like a douchebag  spoiled   year old  super rock star wannabe   the show used to be awesome  however  bam s fame and wealth has led him to believe  that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic  more than actual cool stuff  that used to be in ex  cky k   the acts are so repetitive  there s like nothing new  except annoying stupidity and rehearsed comments  the only things we see is bam margera  so busy showing us how much he doesn t care  how much money he got or whatsoever   i really got nothing much left to say except  give us back cky k  cause bam suck   i enjoy watching steve o  knoxville etc  a thousand times more
