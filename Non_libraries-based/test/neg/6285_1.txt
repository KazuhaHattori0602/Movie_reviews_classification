the perfect   step recipe for a boring middle of the road movie     take one burnt out  rogue ex cop with a bad attitude  yet a sensitive touch as well  closet concert pianist with a pet cat     add some  cool  retro gadgets like a beat up porsche   a roaring bike  a heavily patched leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles     mix in a couple of  free spirit  locations e g  a trendy sea side apartment and a dedicated diner booth for an office     spice it up with  deep  socio romantic themes such as a post divorce traumatized but finally remarrying ex wife  a secretly admiring and therefore forgiving waitress  a pair of former colleague cops only one of whom is really a complete jerk and a best buddy getting iced over a suitcase full of illegal     let it simmer for about   minutes in a  fast paced  though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of mediocre action scenes  cheap tender moments and sluggish wise cracks     serve with either a comfortable pillow to sleep straight through it all or something a bit more interesting  don t worry  even the yellow pages will do
