for those of you who have a few kind words for this film  i suspect you didn t see it when it was released as  parts  the clonus horror    it was a dreadfully boring movie  it missed the mark in at least three ways  it wasn t good enough to be scary  it wasn t bad enough to be funny  although mst k took care of that  and  even in   the plot was unoriginal   earlier contenders are  the resurrection of zachary wheeler    it s the same idea  clones as spare parts  the movie is entertaining  and it had a fine cast  another is  sleeper    yes  the woody allen movie  remember the flattened nose  and  clones    the last two plots aren t as similar to clonus as the first one  but they predate clonus   they are also several fiction books from decades earlier that deal with the idea  although often  the word  clone  isn t used
