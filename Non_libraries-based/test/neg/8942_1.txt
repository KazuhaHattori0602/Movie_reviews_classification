oh my god i am lost now i know everything this guy does is pointless r j a wrote at august  th     posting no    what an awful experience  it looked like a bunch of  rd graders stole a video camera  borrowed some old editing software from   and played a joke on each other  trash rgc wrote at august  st     posting no    this movie is a piece of   it sucks calling this a movie would be misleading  this was a group of friends having a good time and videotaping one another  the storyline was very hard to follow  the attempted artistic camera angles detracted from the story and in to themselves made the entire time a dizzying experience  the acting although comical was very amateurish  the concept is ok  i guess  perhaps next time  the producers should raise some capital and hire actual professionals and try again  i must say that i m sick and tired of so many thinking that making a good movie is easy  it is not easy  this fact seems to be lost or ignored by many that believe that without any training experience and talent that they can make a good product  i guess in the end they will learn just how difficult it is i am so disgusted i have no comment chrisite wrote at august  th     posting no
