a good example of the differences between american and foreign cinema can be seen in a film i recently watched on television  indecent proposal   indecent proposal s two protagonists  david and diane murphy are played woody harrelson and demi moore  i m not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well  but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me  love  affection  playfulness  attraction   none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together   since i knew that eventually robert redford would show up  it was clear from the beginning that the good part  the meat of the movie  would be the scenes between him and demi moore  poor woody harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film  he seemed to be holding back  preoccupied with his receding hairline   ok  so fast forward  what idiots these two  diane and david  are for thinking they can win back the   they owe by gambling  no acting faux pas there  just hideously bad  lazy  unforgivable writing  of course they lose all their money  surprised  i know i wasn t  enter robert redford  john gage in the film    a romantic  perhaps emotionally frigid man  an updated gatsby  a very good role and though not a great  great actor  next to those two  redford looks like olivier  he immediately falls in love and lust with diane and we the viewers for once feel it  this is how to love a woman  not david s way  trading gum mouth to mouth with diane on a slimy pier   did i see that right  as gage  redford wears a suit and tie in every scene  yes it s meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a rich man  but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it  other wardrobe symbolism includes david s now ironed shirts at the end of the film  signifying resolve  getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing   and what is it with california garden parties as depicted in hollywood movies  suddenly everyone appears british  complete with lacy dresses  three piece suits for the men  hats  hats  and of course the parasol  yes diane  her transformation to rich man s fianc e now complete  is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol  though she insisted that she couldn t be bought  she succumbed at last to the sexual tension  here is where the film branches off into pure americana  i mean  of course david and diane will end up together  my question is  why  diane was bored with david  why not let her ride the robert redford wave  and i mean for a good long while  how can she pull herself out of the sexual romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because woody harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party  sits himself down and looks demi moore in the eyes  that s just not how it goes  he was so weak   but we must have our happy ending  we have to swallow the moral lesson  we re not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise  director lyn tried to make a fatal attraction for the juvie set  the young uns   in addition to garden parties in which there s nary an suv  tee shirt  or baseball cap in sight  such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far flung california cities and municipalities  how else to symbolize the return to middle class or working class life
