in this desperate and thoroughly silly attempt to keep hammer s dracula franchise alive despite having lost most of its power long time already  our legendary vampire is brought back to life in the swinging london of   exactly hundred years after he was destroyed by his archenemy van helsing  an occult disciple named johnny alucard  get it  get it  gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church  among them van helsing s great granddaughter jessica  and performs a satanic ritual that resurrects dracula in a haze of smoke  dracula s only mission is to wreak havoc upon the entire van helsing lineage and fragile jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this  this is probably the only  s film that goes immensely over the top in trying to look like
a  s film  considering the previous six dracula films were all set in the victorian era  director alan gibson really wants to stress the fact we re in the  th century now and thus he stuffs his film with insufferable hippie characters  hideous  s fashion trends and awful  s music  christopher lee and peter cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances regretfully show it  the opening sequence  a flashback  and the showdown climax are fairly enjoyable  but everything in between is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary  the greatest elements in this series of films have always been dracula s dark castles and the exhilarating coach races and  obviously  this installment lacks all of that  luckily for the fans  hammer studios contemporary released other films revolving on vampires that are much better  the vampire lovers   twins of evil   the legend of the seven golden vampires
