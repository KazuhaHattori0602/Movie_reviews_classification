obviously  someone was looking at catching onto the  blair witch  wave   this movie was set up like all the  reality  haunted shows that are popping up on tv lately  and i must admit  i get a kick out of these  but this movie is much cheesier  probably the first three quarters of the movie is filled with the  participants  going through the house  whining  give me a break  spending   minutes whining about going up into the attic is not my idea of a good time  any paranormal happenings are blatant setups  no strings  but too perfectly caught on camera to be real  the  participants  were not very likeable either  two goofy guys who don t take it seriously  one girl who scares at the drop of a hat  and the quintessential over played  paranormal  person  is this becoming the clich d formula  for a ghost movie   i have to admit  the last   minutes or so were pure tension  they took every ounce of tension in the movie and stuck it in those   minutes  i admit  i spent that time pacing in the kitchen  i really wouldn t recommend this movie to younger viewers  even if it is pg   if you re looking for some entertainment  if you don t take it seriously  you will get a kick out of this movie  there s tons of situations to make cracks about  if you re looking for an great story line  look elsewhere
