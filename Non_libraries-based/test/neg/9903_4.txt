i think  category   day of destruction  was very unrealistic  the digital effects where like a children s cartoon    the actors didn t act realistically  for example  when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her    the movie was boring but i watched it because it was on    the only interesting character was tornado tommy  he was funny   please keep the special effects real   i liked the comment   what did we do to p i s s off mother nature   i don t know what else to write to fill up the   lines  what else can i say the movie is so boring  i think my comment will be equally boring
