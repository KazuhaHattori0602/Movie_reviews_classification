the name of bad company s greatest hits album is called   from   you could have just turned up this album and cut the sound on this movie  most of the songs played in the movie were from this album  i guess oldsters during the  s were probably tired of all the period pieces made then about the  s and  s  that s how i feel about movies made about the  s  the characters in the movie looked like they were auditioning for danny terrio  why is it that movies have to exaggerate the  s  the only good period piece i liked was  freaks and geeks  they cut that television show  it was exactly like things were in high school when i was there back circa   i was old enough to remember the  s and no small town was like this  it was totally youth dominated  there were no reactionaries talking about the hippies and about the inner city of philly  that was more the  s that i remember as a kid  this movie was very dull and cheesy  at times  i was falling asleep  i don t know why an actor who was acting during the  s  appeared in this one  he was probably trying to lend it some credibility  walken didn t even show up until the second half  i guess the only true thing about the movie was the  baby boomers  were are a spoiled lot  all the kids in the movie were spoiled brats  i don t know what they had against their father
