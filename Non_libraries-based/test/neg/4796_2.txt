it didn t feel like a movie  and was thankfully short  under  minutes  it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics  most of the special effects are great  to be sure  but that cerainly don t a great or even a good movie make  not saying it s absolutely worthless viewing  since it s possible to see what are the possibilities in cgi or gci  or what ever it s called   as i read somewhere   you can t fix it in the cutting room  a bad story and non directed actors  can t be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects  things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real director and material to work from   however they thought this could be sold in usa is anyones idea  since usa is the crooks   and isn t it sooo typical of low budget stories  they have to create an imaginative country south of mexico   well well i gace it   just because of the special effects  the rest is absolute trash
