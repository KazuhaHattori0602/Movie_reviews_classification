in bollywood it isn t rare that worthless films become hits  good films flopping and good actors not making it big  aks is such a movie  himesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell man  just because his songs became a hit that means next he becomes an actor  the producers were sure the film will work perhaps  the songs were a hit too and of course himesh did his cheap publicity as usual  the film tells such a poor story  such poor direction  such poor acting it makes you cringe  indian rickshaws in germany  stunts by himesh and lot of stupidity himesh s cap is intact even when he is in the car which somersaults  direction is poor music is saving grace though most songs sound the same  himesh tries hard but sadly his emotive scenes are a joke  lacks expressions  he is best suited for his music director and some singing he cuts a sorry picture hansika is awful malika is okay sachin khedekar is okay  darshan jhariwala hams
