how does a movie become a biblical epic  simply by quoting a couple of scriptures   using some names out of the bible for your characters  the only thing that was biblical about this epic was the names of the characters  oh  i almost forgot the   kingdoms  israel  egypt   sheba were also used  where did king vidor get the rest of his story from  it surely wasn t from the bible  it was complete   utter nonsense  if you want to read about solomon s reign as king in israel then read   kings       chronicles   you will even come across adonijah in   kings       the queen of sheba   who doesn t show up until king solomon has been king for about   years or so  which by the way  is long after adonijah   joab had been dead  can be found in   kings       chronicles   one of the first thing solomon does is make an affinity with pharoah by taking his daughter   yes  king solomon did get involved with the worshipping of false gods   this is why the kingdom was split after his death  not the temple being destroyed by lightning  also  i think solomon was too busy marrying   providing temples to the false gods of his   wives   tending to his   concubines to be fighting egypt  let alone a dead brother   like i said this movie was utter nonsense  if you aren t gonna use the story in the bible then call it something else  this could ve just as easily been called romeo   juliet or sid   nancy
