apparently i am swimming against the tide of the glowing comments on this film  i have not seen it since i was   or   years old but there is one thing i remember distinctly   the bunyip was terrifying  nightmare inducing terrifying  with the creepy music and the little girl and kangaroo running hopping away for their lives   as a kid i also remember the animated hobbit  no worries  watership down  didn t blink an eye  dot and the kangaroo  it still haunts my dreams  and i have several friends the same age who also think it was massively creepy  maybe we can get a group rate on therapy   in short  one freaky film for its time
