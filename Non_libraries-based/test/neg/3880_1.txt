rs  is all i paid as rent for the dvd of the movie and believe me it is not worth it   bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny  well it is not  please grow up   here goes a dialog from the movie  agar tum ladkee ko ijjat doge to ladkee tumhe apni ijjat degi   plot is useless  criminals and police alike running after fools  that is it  bhagam bhag   well it lived the title  i had to run away from it    i switched over to star movies and watched home alone   instead  and had a good laugh
