admittedly  i watched the mst k version of this  but it s not actually too bad outright  at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred   the story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a  reform school  called girls  town  along way  races  redemption  and wackiness  unintentional  happen  the story and acting are a little flat  as is the action  however  the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored   overall  just a simple sub par  s flick  but far from the worst movie ever made  with some bright spots in the movie  the ave maria sequence was good for me   if you get a chance to watch the mst k version  you won t be disappointed  by it self  not so much  but i can think of worse methods of torture  spiker  anyone
