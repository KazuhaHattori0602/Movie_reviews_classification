well  i have to agree with the critics on this one  who all said  leave it alone  why they had to make this re make of the    psycho  i don t know  my guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modern day actors were the answer  since those were the main changes  the dialog was the same and the story the same   on one hand  i applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film  yet  if they were going to keep everything the same  why bother when you weren t going to improve on tony perkins  janet leigh and the original cast   did they honestly think vince vaughn was going to be as good or better than perkins  are you kidding  ann heche  with her short mannish haircut  is going to be better than leigh  i don t think so   yes  the colors were pretty in here but it s the black and white photography that helped make the   version so creepy to begin with  it s perfect for the story  not a bunch of greens and pinks  once again  i guess the filmmakers were banking on an audience that never saw the original   this was just a stupid project that never should have gotten off the ground
