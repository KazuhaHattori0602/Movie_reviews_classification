this was hitchcock s third hollywood feature  and it appears he was yet to settle into a pattern of consistency  turning from faithful adaptation of classic novel in rebecca  to espionage thriller in foreign correspondent  and now this romantic comedy in the mould of the  screwball  pictures of the  s   hitchcock s formal method  on the other hand  had by now settled into something consistent  so much so that he was unable  or at least unwilling  to deviate from it  it was unwise then for him to step outside his usual genre  and a romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate  in rebecca it was actually great to see hitchcock constrained by his producer and the source text  forced to turn his technique to heavy gothic drama  but for mr and mrs smith there is a huge mismatch between form and content  in other words  hitchcock was no ernst lubitsch   first  let s look at the romantic angle  the best love scenes in hitchcock films were wild  passionate and slightly dangerous   the  ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn t have  situation  and he was great at depicting that  this is something that makes a much earlier film  rich and strange  one of the few hitchcock non thrillers that really works  hitch is not so good however when it comes to a more gentle and familiar love story  a light  tender touch is required and hitch doesn t have it   secondly  take the comedy  of course  hitchcock films could be funny   the lady vanishes is probably the best example   but only when the jokes were sprinkled throughout the story  the master of suspense simply isn t enough of a comedy director to create a film that has funny bones  he cuts up scenes as he would in a thriller   snappy opposing angles of people talking  inserted close ups of hands and feet  point of view shots   but doesn t allow for comic timing or focus on gags  for example  the business with carole lombard s dress bursting at the seems is shown to us with a couple of close ups  but these are timed more as if he were revealing some crucial plot point  and have no comedic impact  occasionally hitchcock s style does roughly coincide with the comedy   for example the arrangement of characters in the scene at the club  where robert montgomery tries to make it look as if he is with the attractive  sophisticated woman at the next table   but such moments are few and far between   even the cast of mr and mrs smith are not up to standard  i m not sure this was robert montgomery s strength lay  and he is boring here  this was of course exactly where  queen of screwball  carole lombard s strength lay  and yet while she is clearly acting well the scenes are simply not geared to capturing comedy performances  even jack carson  who could be hilarious when he was really allowed to let go before the camera  fails to perk things up at all  of course  neither of these fine comedy actors is helped by the screenplay  which isn t exactly bursting with laughs in the first place  even if the basic story is a fairly good premise   the only full on comedy hitchcock made after this was the trouble with harry  and that sort of worked because it played upon his familiar suspensefulness  however it was only when the story could exist independently of the humour  when the basic framework was suspense   as it is in the lady vanishes or family plot   that hitchcock was capable of doing comedy well
