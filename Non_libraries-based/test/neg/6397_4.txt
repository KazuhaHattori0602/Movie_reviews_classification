all in all  don t expect much and you won t be disappointed   and if you want to see a movie that will take you back to   this will do that for sure  the only reason i gave this movie   points more than it deserves is for   reasons     michael caine    the people  the sights  the culture and the music of brazil   the movie is almost completely carried by caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi believable story  even joe bologna and valerie harper fall short    michael caine is pure class  as always  besides being a gifted classical and comic actor  caine brings a blend of introspection  mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does   the focus of his charm as far back as his role in alfie and the reason why he won the academy award for hannah and her sisters   years later  in this farce  he is tenderly beguiling funny and vulnerable  melancholy and sentimental and besides the jewel that is rio de janeiro  the only reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment   well maybe a glimpse at the   lovely young actresses  michelle johnson and demi moore would be a reason  but look is all you can do at michelle  though her look seems sorely dated there couldn t be a more painful movie experience than watching her  try  to act  most of her dialogue seems overdubbed  too  demi s acting and looks hold up   times better and you could easily transplant her  as is  into any movie today  she doesn t really look much different to be honest  ms  moore is surely underused  especially considering she was the bigger star of the     save the fact that it is a silly farce  at the end  i actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation that it doesn t end friendships nor marriages and that an affair  even with the underage daughter of your best friend  could be forgiven and everyone can move on  the injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired  but all works out for the best a bit unrealistic for sure  but surprisingly refreshing  hope always is
