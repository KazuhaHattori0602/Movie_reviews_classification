i don t care what anyone else says  this movie is the worst piece of trash committed on film  what was john landis thinking   i know it s based on a series of children s books  but c mon  even kids hate this movie  it s pointless and boring  tom arnold once again amply demonstrates that his only talent is wasting production money   i think the only reason the stupids hasn t appeared on the   worst films of all time is that only   or so people will admit to watching this garbage  at least hobgoblins made it on mst k
