i ll dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies  they are too numerous to name  a much shorter list would be what they got right    dude named noah    ark with animals on it    if you want a much more accurate portrayal of noah s ark and the destruction of sodom  go rent  the bible    it depicts the story of creation through abraham attempting to sacrifice his son isaac  it s a much better movie  and it may be that the abomination called  noah s ark    drove you to seek just such a film      i really couldn t stomach watching the whole movie  from reading other comments  i can see that even the atheists found it grossly inaccurate  as a christian  it was intolerable to me  possibly the worst movie ever made  no real point to this movie either  except maybe to showcase their sub par computer animation   was it a complete waste  maybe not  god can use evil to work good    romans   says  [ ] and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god  to them who are the called according to his purpose   genesis   says  [ ] but as for you  ye thought evil against me  but god meant it unto good  to bring to pass  as it is this day  to save much people alive   in the second example  joseph s brothers meant to kill him  but god turned their evil into a very great good  he may have done the same thing with this movie   people were so astonished by its lack of biblical foundation  that they probably broke out the dusty old bible and read the story for themselves  to find out about lot and sodom  they would have to go the whole way up to genesis   before god destroys sodom and gomorrah  by then  they have read almost half of genesis  so they might want to finish  the next book is exodus  which the movie  the ten commandments  was based on  and much more accurately  if they have seen that movie  then exodus becomes an easy read  so now they have read at least two whole books of the bible  just because they watched a pathetic movie about noah s ark  i m sure this actually happened to someone out there   god works in mysterious ways
