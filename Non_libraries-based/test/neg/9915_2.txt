a wasted effort  on the surface it s a typical disaster movie  we re involved in the lives of a few people who get caught up in the big event  however  the script is so awful and there s so much explaining of the characters  background within the dialogue that we feel we re being treated like morons  even sesame street didn t explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died  we can work it out  someone thought that entering  enron  into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies  the acting is by and large bland  with the exception of the older performers  randy quaid  brian dennehy  and after the first hour  i couldn t care less about who the storms took out   but maybe there are the special effects to watch  sadly  no  even on a  year old tv set i could see one tractor and trailer were computer generated badly  maybe there are budgetary limitations  so i can forgive that one  footage of a plane trying to land looked pretty real  but i kept telling myself i had seen that before  this site confirms it  it was from an earlier film  nowhere to land   so in summary  the only good bits are from another film  and when you see the best action sequences compressed into a  second network promo  it makes category   look quite good  my advice  rely on your network to do some good  second clips  watch them  and save yourself two nights
