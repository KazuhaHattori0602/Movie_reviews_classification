my ratings  acting     suspense     character attachment     plot     character development     overall      this show sucks very much officially  for me  csi miami is the best  csi ny  nd and csi  th  i don t know  in the other csis you get into the episode you re watching  but in this one  you just can t get into the episode  no matter how much you try  so in my opinion  this show is not worth watching  i know people have different opinions  and i respect that  but for me  this csi ain t good enough  so if you like suspense  real acting performance  good plot  direction  character development attachment and you an overall good show  i suggest you to watch csi miami
