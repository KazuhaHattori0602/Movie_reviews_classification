maybe this wowed them in the  s  but this is one of those flicks that doesn t age well  it s got that preachy  earnest  downtrodden working man vibe of a  nd rate rod serling live tv  playhouse  broadcast  the  plot  is by the book  the cassevetes character s troubled background seems tacked on  and the love interest is unconvincing and half hearted   sidney portier gives an ok performance  but man he sure was an annoying  haughty snot  if i had to work with this guy in a warehouse i d probably want to hit him with a grappling hook too  jack warden is good  because as usual  he plays jack warden   like   of the films rated on imdb  whether they are classics  mediocre or crapola  somehow this one gets rated with  point some stars  it is in no way deserving of that  save your time
