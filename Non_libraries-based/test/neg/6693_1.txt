from all the rave reviews  we couldn t wait to see this show  we love wacky humor and creative material  especially from australia and new zealand   i admit this may not be a fair review since we only saw the first   minutes  but we just couldn t bear any more misery   it was definitely the most boring and painful   minutes we ve ever experienced watching a tv show   it felt like   hours  the songs may be  mildly  interesting by themselves  but inserted for an interminable   minutes each in the middle of a story scene just doesn t work   we re trying hard now to erase the memory  if you want some wonderful down under humor in a delightful and engaging film  see  the dish  instead
