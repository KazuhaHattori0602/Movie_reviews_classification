rarely will anyone deny that hitchcock remains one of the most creative  inventive and prolific directors of all time  because he is arguably all of these things  it takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties  saboteur  however  is not creative or prolific at all  rather  hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster  american pride  a certain call to arms  support our troops title which was a popular theme of the time  with that in mind  hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film  including but not limited to a logical plot  characterization  believable dialog  and a fluent  running storyline    typically hitchcock does great with espionage films  only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with the foreign corespondant and the   steps  but seemingly lost his stride in creating saboteur and merely recycled the same once thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided  without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems      despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across america  the only person who recognizes kane is blind     at the dinner party  kane and patricia don t want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were  gate crashers  logically  what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening  besides  does anyone need to be reminded kane is a wanted terrorist     since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs      nobody recognizes him his face is on every newspaper      the spies catch up with kane in the ghost town and assume he s the man freeman sent to work with them shouldn t t he have some sort of credentials  i know spies don t run around with name tags and photo ids but a secret handshake maybe      cop picks up kane escaping from freeman s house  still seems no one recognizes this guy     how exactly does the fbi come to believe kane with no evidence  they don t even show kane talking to the fbi  the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher     when the cops search the carnival caravan how do they know kane is now with a woman  the blind man believed kane s story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing  kidnapped  or even more importantly running with kane  why does this movie not employ logic   this is a running list  the movie is not exciting  the plot makes no sense  and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing  hitchcock fails miserably on this one
