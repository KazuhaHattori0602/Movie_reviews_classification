  looked like it was shot in some guy s basement  the quality was so pitiful that i couldn t stand watching it  i saw about   minutes or so and i had to take it back to blockbuster and get something else  i can t understand how something so amateurish some from someone like chris hegedus  how the hell did this win any awards to begin with  the war room definitely deserved an award  as did another great documentary called ameragosa  both won awards  this documentary looked like it was done by uncle joe who also does weddings on the weekends  shaky  dimly lit  unflattering lighting  bad sound  a   year old could make a better film than that guy did
