well i had the chance to view this film the other day  i didn t know what to expect as i never saw the trailer and such  but what i did discover simply by watching the first   minutes is that this film is the worst i have ever had the misfortune to see   i wish i could give it this film a   rating  the first   minutes were bad but as soon as it goto the party scene i wanted to just enter a coma it was really poorly done  the actors didn t have any direction  there was no real story  i read some reviews that state its good if you have a little child to entertain for   minutes etc  but really why should we expose children to this type of film  its got poor humor  rude and crude comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill   of its time  i am sure a few people in hollywood will be out on the streets after this film bombs   also how can   people give this movie a   i mean get real anyone that gives this movie a   either has some mental issue and or works for the film company  this movie should average at   instead of its current   due to the people that ranked it   truly sad
