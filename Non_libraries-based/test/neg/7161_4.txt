after the book i became very sad when i was watching the movie  i am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable  some examples     why the ranks are different  e g  lt  diestl instead of sergeant etc     the final screen is very poor and makes diestl as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die  but it is not true in   just read the book  he was a bull dog in the last seconds as well  he did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to michael   noah    so this is some kind of a happy end which does not fit at all for this movie
