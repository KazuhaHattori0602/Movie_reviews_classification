what can i say about this  such a big prestige production   but in the end  wasted time  wasted money   this work a disaster is historically seen  only some examples     augustus often is named  gaius    his first name  pronomen  but the old romans don t used this name  correct would be the surname  nomen gentile and cognomen  or the  octavian   caesar   augustus     livia was shown as tyrannic wife  but this historically wrong     iulia was shown as nice young woman   but she wasn t one  adultery and  maybe  prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing     she wasn t at the dying bed of her father  she never was allowed to leave her banishing  and she was at this time around   years old  not as young as she was shown  in the same year augustus died she committed suicide  because tiberius stopped giving her a pension     augustus was much more scruplesless then in this movie shown  but author and director seems to believe augustus  own  res gestae   what remains  historically extremely doubtful  bad acting  bad built and equipment     points out of     one for peter o toole
