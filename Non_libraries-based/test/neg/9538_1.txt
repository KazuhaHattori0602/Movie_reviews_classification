ok   say some college in southern california has an movie making class  and some dudes were enrolled just to film girls  and they gave them a camera  and then they were drunk stoned  or just to plain stupid to actually use a camera  and they turned this in for their grade  and failed   that is my only explanation for this  this  thing  good god they left the date and time counter on during some of it  the picture started in new scene way before the sound  and forget about a plot  well apparently there was one and they had to tell you all about it once the   hour introduction sequence was finished  but i am glad they did because i never would have gotten it by watching this   stay away from this
