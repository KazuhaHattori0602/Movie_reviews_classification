frankly i met real han su ying before and seeing her portrayed by an american actress which has no resemblance of anything chinese makes my head spin while i am watching this movie why can t hollywood get nancy kwan instead   at least its more true to the story cos for goodness sake dr han su ying is chinese i know cos i have meet her in person  and looking at the whole cast so few asian faces in a movie about a asian love story makes me wonder too   i think the acting is good but without real asian faces in a asian love story makes the plot so corny and a whole load of baloney  its just like another movie i know of   the conqueror  imagine my eyes pop out when i see john wayne as genghis khan   and to make matter worst  how on earth can a man born an bred in mongolian steppes come up with a alabama southern accent    and a cheap imitation of anything asian  good grief  i am not surprise that one day i will see dr martin luther king jr being played by one of the boys from the black and white minstrel show  would love to see that  and laugh the whole roof off    cheers
