i m not sure this film could ever match the first one  even if it starred the original seven  notwithstanding the fact that four were killed  it just doesn t have the spark and chemistry  all the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecks   it s interesting how yul brynner is  magnificent  in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel  yet when he stars in westworld and futureworld in the  s his character  in the same matching black pants  shirt and hat  evokes the same mystery and presence of the   film s chris adams   there s nothing in this   flick to make it worth watching  even on cable
