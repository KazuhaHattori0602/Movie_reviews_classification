why is guy working for buddy  probably because ari was not around in   why does dawn want to be with guy  for access to buddy  why does she stay with guy  i am not sure   there are bunch of things about this movie that i am not sure about  but  kevin spacey is an excellent  verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman   and totally believable because he is a great actor   frank whaley s guy is certainly out of his element working for buddy   he wants to write and make meaningful movies  not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting equal instead of sweet   low    michelle forbes  dawn  who also wants to make meaningful movies  seems way out of guy s league   the ending leaves a lot to be desired
