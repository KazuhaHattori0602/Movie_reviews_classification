i bought this  film  from a gas station in the   bin for one reason  billy drago  who is one of my favorite actors  he is terrifically creepy and good  but that s where it stops  the movie itself is a dirt cheap  gratingly awful attempt at a horror western  and manages neither  never mind a successful merging of the two genres  the acting besides drago s is so bad i wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears  the production values are nonexistent and the script   i don t even know where to start   avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard drago fan like me   terrible  shameful unforgivable
