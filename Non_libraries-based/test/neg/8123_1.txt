i don t care if this show is suppose to be communicating profound messages about human existence   the show is crap how can anyone derive pleasure from watching it  yet it was received so well  this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there   i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it  the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry   it is beyond belief that people can watch this show  yet i guess the creators had the last laugh making themselves wealthy by taking the p ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this   i would wager they are laughing all the way to the bank
