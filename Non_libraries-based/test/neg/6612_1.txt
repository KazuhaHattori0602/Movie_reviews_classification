this movie is trash from the word go  first  it gives an account of a season that took place   years ago  who cares  this movie had about as much depth as a bottle cap  it makes a complex person like bob knight into a cartoon character   swearing doesn t bother me  but i m still amazed that espn showed a movie with more cursing than a kevin smith movie on a basic cable channel  the f word was dropped at least   times before the first commercial break   this movie was terrible and anyone associated with it should be embarrassed  i rate this on the same level as jaws iv   the revenge and everybody wins  movies that are in the crapfest hall of fame
