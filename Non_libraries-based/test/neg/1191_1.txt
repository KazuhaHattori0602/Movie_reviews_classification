am i right in thinking i went to see the same film as everyone else   this film was terrible  i m a fan of all   series of the league of gentelmen and have always respected the originality of the writers  even when the format changed in series   this film however was a blatant half effort  the plot was extremely poor having the characters going into the real world made this film see more like the last action hero  there was about   moments in the film that got a mild chuckle but the rest of the time i was wishing it would end  this would have been better as a   minute short on the dvd   it was more of an explanation of what they planned to do  and looked like some of the writers disagreed on the fate of the characters and they made a joke of this by killing him off in the first   minutes   if your a true fan of the league of gentlemens ability to stay fresh then you ll hate this film  if you only watch it cause there was nothing better on tv then u ll love it   someone back me up
