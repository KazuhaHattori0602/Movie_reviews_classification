here s a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game  turkey shoot  gymkata and the running man   certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work  generally bland action sequences  a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout   take for example towards the end of the film  when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains  he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep  upon discovery of the said corpse  the villains response   bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all    they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit    however  i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode  even if his screen time is very limited   not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b movie enthusiasts
