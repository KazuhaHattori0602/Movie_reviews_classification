dear friends  i ve never seen such a trash movie as night of the demons   it seems that the director kevin tenney had the intention to copy classics like the evil dead by sam raimi   or george a  romero s return of the living dead from the same year  the cinematography was lousy  the movie was very dark  so i had to turn the brightness control to the maximum  indeed  horror pictures have to be dark  but not the way like night of the demons  the entire movie was ridiculous  no suspense  worse actors except alvin alexis in the role of rodger  and horrible make up effects  an average vote of   stars for that movie  i can t believe this  perhaps the users were pleased about the tits  asses and pussies of the actresses  they were indeed worth   stars  regards  hans dieter
