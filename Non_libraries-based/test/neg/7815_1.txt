this is by far the most awful movie i have ever watched  i have never before rated a movie   out of   my advice is don t watch it  this doesn t even classify as a movie   you d be better off sitting on the couch bored rather than watching this movie  acting was terrible but what was worst by far was the storyline  highly unlikely sequence of events which aren t even funny  they are actually very lame and stupid  very foolish choice by ashton kutcher and tara reid to act in this movie  might even upset their careers a little   when i walked into blockbuster  the main focus was on this movie   so i decided rent it  i sincerely regret it   once you re   or   minutes into the movie you could basically predict what was going to happen  i was hoping it would get better   but instead it got worse   i am not exaggerating this  the movie is terrible  don t watch it  hope this helps
