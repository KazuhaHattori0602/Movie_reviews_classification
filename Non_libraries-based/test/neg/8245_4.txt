i m racking my brain  but i can t seem to think of another movie quite like the valley of the gwangi  a western with dinosaurs  what could be more natural  you gotta wonder why john ford and or john wayne never tried it    the plot   while searching for a mythical miniature horse for her circus  tj breckenridge  gila golan  tuck kirby  james franciscus  and the rest of the cast characters enter a strange  lost valley  there they find not only the miniature horse  but some other  more fearsome creatures as well  dinosaurs rule this place  now wouldn t that be an attraction at tj s circus   a caged t rex    it s not that i find the valley of the gwangi a bad movie  i just don t seem to have enjoyed it as much as many others who have posted comments on the movie  there are some parts that i actually find almost unwatchable  for the first half of the movie  there just doesn t seem to be much going on  i wasn t necessarily bored  but i did want something to happen  plodding would be an adjective i would use  to top it off  the movie features a very contrived love story  it feels forced as if the writers decided that the male and female leads just had to get together  but the valley of the gwangi isn t a total waste  there are moments i really enjoyed  who doesn t get a kick out of the scenes of the cowboys on horseback trying to lasso a t rex  you just don t see stuff like that every day  ray harryhausen s creatures are impressive  there are some really cool shots of harryhausen s miniatures interacting with people and horses  it might not represent the best of his work  but the effects are very nice  still  at least in my mind these good moments aren t enough to overcome the negatives  as much as i hate to do it  i ve got to rate the valley of the gwangi a
