okay  when i bought this flick i though this gotta be the ultimate b movie  space monkey landing to the earth and starts right away to kill people    well  it was almost everything what i expected  typical low budget scifi movie from the  s  acting has to be the worst i ve ever seen  especially the girl playing the lead role and the girl that played the waitress made me laughing my ass off    so why  night fright  doesn t fall in to category  so bad that it s good  reason why is that some of the scenes were just too long and boring  for example the scene were the police officers are searching clues in the woods it was just minutes of walking without purpose  and then the grand finale  the people s waiting for the monster about   minutes and when the space monkey appears it get wack d in   second  end of film   yeah   night fright  is boring  but it got couple of funny moments  i can recommend this movie to all who liked films like  zontar  the thing from venus  or  curse of the swamp creature   i give  night fright    space monkey slaps out of     rob gruesome
