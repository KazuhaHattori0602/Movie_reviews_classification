this film is definitely up there with the worst films i ve ever seen  probably in my top   of worst films  i laughed once and that was when   evan   im building something  evan s secretary   i hope its a barber shop   that was literally the only time i laughed in this  comedy  awful compared to bruce almighty which as a big jim carrey fan wasn t even that great    this movie lacked the humour of having god s powers and was more about family bonding  id class it solely as a family movie  definitely not a family comedy    seeing a bird poo on someone s shirt is not hilarious  neither is a beard that grows back instant   i didn t even think the special effects were great  the animals looked really stuck on  it was like watching a film which hadn t been  glued  together properly    film   avoid
