please  if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves  i think i missed his entire point  because i walked out feeling like reggio relied on cold war era footage of space exploration  and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology  trails of   and   denoting technology and math and science   done that  anyone out there see the matrix  and motion studies of people in motion  ever heard of edward muybridge  at least he uses exact clips of muybridge s photographs of human motion studies   this film was derivative  and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he s done in the past   years  avoid this film at all costs
