boring movie  poor plot  poor actors  the movie happens in a room supposed to be in morocco but actually in some american city  the  arab terrorists  are the patriots the blonde patriot is the  arab terrorist damn   there is something good about this movie though  that s why the score is   out of   the director turns the ridiculous stereotype about terrorism the media feeds us every day into the real thing  the terrorists are americans  or western people if you like   the movie is divided into two parts  the first part of the movie concerns the dutchman travel   seconds  while the second part is about the staying in the amazing dark brown room   hour and something   the dutch guy is going to deliver money in morocco to some  charity organization  gets off the plain  takes the bus and ends up kidnapped in a dark brown room  he is kidnapped with another guy that is shot after telling  they will not shoot at us  the dutch survivor is forced to play chess with a morpheus like arab guy for so long that you ll learn how to play chess too  at the end the dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four of his fingers off but because he is tricked by such a lame game you should watch the movie for   good when you are so tired you can t sleep
