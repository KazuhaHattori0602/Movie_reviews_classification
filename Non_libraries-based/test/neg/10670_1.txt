first things first  how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this  i saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head  what exactly is director trying to say   if its a thriller  there are no thrills  if its action  there is no action barring a chase sequence  there is no drama  and the much touted love story  it actually never takes off  no passion  emotion nothing is there   actually i never expected wonders from the movie  however after the bumper opening it took  i thought of giving it a chance  i have no problems with himesh reshamiya whatsoever  and i am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity  i went in with an open mind and came out with a closed one   let s not put the blame of himesh reshamiya  he is just a debutant actor  but direction  screenplay  writing  makeup  everything has gone for a toss   himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve  he can do the don kind of roles  hansika is just a kid  and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks   the only actor who was good was the friend of himesh in the movie  i don t know his name  but he looks promising   watch it at your own risk  not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing     strongly recommend to avoid this movie
