like anyone else who bought this  i was duped by the   pieces of extreme gore  and  banned in   countries  or whatever it says in the box  i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it  tom savini  rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business  the revolutionized make up effects in the  s  today  you don t need them as everything is done on computer  but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up  but i digress   watching fantastically gory films like fulci s gates to hell or even savini s crowning achievement  friday the  th the final chapter  you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film  you can t tell the difference between reality and magic   i can t imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film  if that is the reason you seek this film  then you are wasting your money  as many other reviewers in here have noted  most of the gore is an aftermath  you don t see the torture  or the bloodshed as it happens  you see whatever it looks like afterwords   the gore  well  it s here  but not as much as one would hope  or expect  a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts  but other then those two scenes  and one involving a scalping  there is nothing really much else to this film  the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned  are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for  maybe it s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre  but i was expecting a bit more  call me sick or twisted  but isn t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place  i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places   cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film  while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film  it is much better than this tripe  if you go out of your way to buy this for   you will feel cheated
