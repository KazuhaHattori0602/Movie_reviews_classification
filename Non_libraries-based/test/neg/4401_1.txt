  won t be long on this movie  the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i ve started watching movies  the story didn t advanced  nothing was explained about any of the characters  it felt like a non movie   a lot of people had already left the audience at this point   a lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained   the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence  each scene  has to make the story go forward  he never did that   the supposedly funny moments were contrived  and only a few people laughed  people with a weird sense of humor  i guess   prize of the jury in cannes  don t know what the jury was thinking about probably the  politicly correct effect   i would have loved to love it  the disappointment was therefore even bigger   you have to see it to believe it  but wait for the video
