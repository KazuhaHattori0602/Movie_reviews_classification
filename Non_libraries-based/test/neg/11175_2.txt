ring  ring  have been horror directors hotline  how may we help you  um
yeah
pronto  i mean hello  my name is rugge
 err  call me by my initials r d  okay mr  r d  what seems to be the problem  well the reviews on my latest movie  dial  help  were all negative and harsh and  frankly  i myself feel like my career has seen better days as well  okay mr  r d  and why do you suppose that is  well  i gained fame and a well deserved cult status thanks to my controversial and shocking movie about savage tribes of cannibals devouring a film crew and another one about relentless thugs terrorizing wealthy people in a house at the edge of the park  for which i borrowed the idea from wes craven  but  dial  help  revolves on 
 err
 never mind  no no  mr  r d  go ahead and tell me what the film is about  um  it s about a spiritually possessed phone line stalking a sexy model and killing the people surrounding her  ah  i see  that premise does indeed sound a little silly and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists  but i suppose there are deeper themes in your film  right  oh yeah  sure
 um  what do you mean by that  well  isn t the phone line symbolism for another kind of terror  or perhaps it s all just happening in the mind of your female heroine  um  nope
 it s just about a phone going berserk and murdering people with the cord  vibrations  electricity or even ordinary coins  interesting  mr  r d  but how do you explain all this supernatural stuff to the viewer at the end of the movie  you see  i figured the slowly unraveling phone mystery plot wouldn t be that important or relevant  so i just concentrated on processing all possible phone gimmicks i could think of  phone gimmicks  what do you mean  you know  like wind blowing through the horn  mind penetrating dial tones  and turn tables catapulting into the air  very original  mr  r d  but not exactly horrific and as an experienced director you must know that  in the end  people expect a reasonable clarification of all these events  oh  but there is  it all has to do with negative and unreleased energy  if i remember correctly  it s all a bit fuzzy  i admit  hmm
 i see  oh well  as they always say  a good motion picture relies on more elements than just the story  did you at least process some of your regular trademarks into the film  so that your fans at least recognize your style  i tried  lord knows i tried  but the murders and bloodshed are simply not shocking anyone  that s a pity indeed  mr  r d  but what about sex  everyone likes a good portion of sleaze and nudity in their horror films and you said yourself the film centered on a sexy fashion model in peril  yes  but 
 but what  mr  r d  well  to tell you the truth  we kind of promoted  dial  help  as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of charlotte lewis on the cover  but in reality there s no sex in the film and charlotte even refused to go topless  mr  r d  now i m really disappointed  that s just shamelessly ripping people off and lure them with false promises  i know  i know  and i m ashamed  but i just wanted everybody to rent  dial  help  and love it  well  to round up i can comfort you by saying that every major director is entitled to a few erroneous decisions without it affecting his her career immediately  but be more cautious next time and do some research first  okay mr  r d  i will  thank you  you re welcome  tell me  have you got any ideas for upcoming movies already  yeah  as a matter a fact  i do  i was thinking about making a giallo with a murderous washing machine  doesn t that sound fascinating  hello  hello
