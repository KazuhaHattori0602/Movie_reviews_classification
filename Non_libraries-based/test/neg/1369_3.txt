i was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters  and i saw it in japan  the film s plot wasn t my cup of tea as a high school sophomore  but i went to see it for the  d process  it had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it  though it never screened at the post theater   the film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience  which was taken to absurd levels with later  d films   i don t know whether this qualifies as a spoiler  but you ve been warned if it is  in many films of the time  actors would often work in front of a  rear projection screen  where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment  such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage  this works well on regular films  but when seen in  d  they look like a flat scene behind the actors  there were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used  and it didn t work well in the theaters  if seen in  d  it will constitute another disappointment   the film s only importance is historical  since it was the first of its kind
