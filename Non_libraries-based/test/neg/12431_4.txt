 it s just bad  he tries to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialog and body hair close ups  but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic   simply put  wassup rockers is a teenage boy s fantasy  what  year old boy doesn t want to be a skater who gets in trouble  crashes parties  drinks  s  and is told by the hot  rich  white girl that his uncircumcised penis  looks dangerous  besides that demographic  i really don t know who s going to enjoy this film
