i could not watch more than   minutes of this movie  it has set the standard  i will never again give a movie a   unless it was as horrible as this one  i fully agree with the other comments about this film  but  since i m dutch  i watched it with dutch translation  apparently  they didn t have money for a proper translation  so they decided to babelfish it  with sometimes hilarious results   don t smoke  don t drink  don t do drugs  don t watch demon summer   i was surprised that the actors  wow  i can t believe i just said that  didn t hold the script  was there any  in their hands while shooting  i think they also did a good job on  well  uhmm  no  they didn t do a good job at all
