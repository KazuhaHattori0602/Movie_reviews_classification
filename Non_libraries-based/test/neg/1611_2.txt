stranded in space   mst k version   a very not good tv movie pilot  for a never to be made series  in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on earth s evil twin  having a planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth  but on the opposite side of the sun  is a well worn sf chestnut   the idea is over   years old  having been invented by the ancient greeks  in this version the counter world is run as an orwellian  perfect  society  where  for totally inexplicable reasons  everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars  after escaping from his prisonlike hospital  the disruptive earthian is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie stalwart cameron mitchell who  like his minions  wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers   a stylishly evil combination which i fully intend to adopt if ever i become a totalitarian overlord  our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world s three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home   thus setting up one of those man alone in a hostile world making a new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the  s and  s  the fugitive   the incredible hulk   the littlest hobo  etc  the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence  somewhere between  stranded in space  first airing  under the title  the stranger  in   and the mst k version in   it somehow acquired some footage from the   movie  prisoners of the lost universe  so in   the opening credits for  stranded in space  run under a few shots of three people falling into a matter transmitter and vanishing  it s a sequence that has nothing to do   even thematically   with anything that is going to follow   just to add to the nerdy b movie confusion  one of the actors in this nailed on footage  kay lenz  later appeared in a   movie called  trapped in space  knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts   if you could ever work out a way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like a total idiot
