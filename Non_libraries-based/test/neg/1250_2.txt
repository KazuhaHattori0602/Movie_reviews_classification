 e on  how about a little nuance  how about some interesting bad guys  writer director a w  vidmer should be singled out for special notice  not only is the dialogue leaden  the pacing  within dialogue and at either end of many scenes  makes this movie at least   minutes longer than it needs to be  and believe me  it feels like longer  the talents of imperioli  renee faia and some of the supporting cast  steve schirripa  natch  are the only things that keep this from a   rating  all of their good work is nearly offset  though  by the atrocious job of portraying the boy stuey  not sure if it was a casting mistake  hey   it s a mob movie  so let s cast someone from blue s clues who can t do anything but over overact with a big fake grin next let s cast the sullen  brooding kid in the disney flick  or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch   i d be interested in another filmmaker s take on this character and his story  it s a shame imperioli has already been used up by this flick  awful  awful  awful
