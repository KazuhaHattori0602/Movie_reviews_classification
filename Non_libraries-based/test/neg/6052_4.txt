the problem with this movie is that it is trying to compile a   hours movie into   hours  the result is clear  it seems too forced  unclear and too simple minded   the only plus side is the beginning  it explains well why and how hercules was born  the rest of the movie was just mumbo jumbo that is put together  it has a potential to be a great movie like lotr if only it is not forced into   hours   the acting is not very convincing either  ok not all is bad  but most of them are  special effects are stupid and look like it is made ten years earlier  although the  st monster is pretty good  overall  i give it   out of ten for the reasons i described above
