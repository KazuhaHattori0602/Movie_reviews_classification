when underdog the cartoon debuted in   at the age of   i was hooked immediately  he was top dog  pun intended  in my book that is  until batman premiered on abc a year or so later  even when it was clear that disney was going to make a live action version of the once popular saturday morning cartoon  it was equally clear to me that it was going to be a piece of crap  even reading the reviews in the papers seemed to confirm this  however  i made it a point to  a  never attempt to write a review unless i have seen the movie from start to finish  and b  never to spend one red cent on a movie that i m almost certain i will hate   thanks to youtube i  a  am fully qualified to write this review  and b  it only cost me   minutes of my hard earned time   it also proves my point  namely  that this movie is not merely a piece of crap  it s a steaming pile of dog droppings  it resembles the tv series in name only  even though they almost got it right with simon and cad   all in all  underdog is a huge waste of time  and money  which thankfully  i didn t have to spend   rating    out of
