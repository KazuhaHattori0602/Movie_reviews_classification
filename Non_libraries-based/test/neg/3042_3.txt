while babysitting at an isolated colorado house  a teen girl is terrorized by an elusive murderer on the telephone   remake of the   semi classic horror film basically takes the opening   minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an   minute time span  so it s pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin  there s little in the way of originality or interest in this movie  there s a lot of camilla belle wondering around a dark house wondering who s calling her and encountering all kinds of false scares  it all gets repetitious and routine after the first   minutes and never manages to muster up much in the way of suspense or chills  it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film  especially since it wimps out and changes one important plot point from the original  i guess we have the pg  rating to thank for that   on the plus side there s an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere  unfortunately there s not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub par  belle s performance is pretty mediocre too   it s just another unimpressive remake       out of
