this episode sucks   over the past few years i have watched all episodes of  next generation  and  voyager  and am now watching  enterprise   i am thoroughly enjoying this series  until this episode  i stared at the screen in horror at the destruction of character and entertainment  it is more like an attempt at slapstick   it does not build the characters but throws them out on a limb   and leaves the audience gasping  it does little to build the series   why this was ever allowed to go to air amazes me  was it the writing  was it the directing  was it the producer  we ll probably never know   but one bad apple isn t bad i suppose  i say that hoping it is only one
