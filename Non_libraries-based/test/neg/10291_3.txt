this movie was  good  relatively during the first parts of it   we have a story  from   points of view  so let s find some clues and complete the story   oh wait none of that stuff matters because the fbi guys are the bad guys  though that was a great twist it was almost a terrible twist  i immediately downgraded the film from a   maybe   to   based on the last   minutes of it   does anyone else not see why the twist is so bad  yes  it s a good shock  but it is bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the preceding hour and twenty minutes  there s no connection to the killers   the killers are in about all of   minutes of this movie  as killers  and the two fbi agents are only in   minutes of the previous hour and twenty   we get it surveillance oh  the killers are voyeurs  which makes no sense  because they were only described in limited terms as just being psychopaths  and the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the   stories goes out the window as everyone is dead in   minutes   all of this makes the ending even more ridiculous  oh  they killed a bunch of fbi agents in the beginning what fbi agents sleep together  all in the same room  to be found and murdered by amateurs and then impersonated by people who know nothing about being fbi agents  a cop   feet away apparently can t hit either one with a standard police issue pistol that can shoot several shots  i hate movies that try to make you feel like this could be real when they make absurd leaps they think we will believe   the other thing is the movie ends about   minutes after they are revealed as the killers with a girl standing in the field somewhere
