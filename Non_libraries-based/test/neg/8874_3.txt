this movie may bear some historical importance  and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together  the setting  the rocket  the space suits  the surface of the moon  all scream  a classic    but in the end  the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes  and the  ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments  the characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis  but bear too little entertainment value many times   much of this movie seems like a good movie for nine year olds  the mature themes  the human drama and the violence are kept to a level suitale for children as well   the images of the earth and the moon seen from space may actually be more accurate than the ones in   but so what if their use is dramatically inefficient  especially   may seem like a stretched out meditation over themes of this movie  and  has star wars not somehow modelled it s space scrolling opening titles on the opening titles of this film  but then again   the inheritance is marginal   if its a real groundbreaking and mega influential mature  ies sci fi classic you are looking for however  check out  forbidden planet
