persuaded by the   points in imdb  which is pretty good  i decided to watch this movie  however  i found this movie quiet boring  about   hours  and full of clich s  a little girl getting multiple personalities after a childhood trauma etc  tamer karadagli is quiet funny in this movie  dialogs motions etc  you will have to see it  he is kinda the tough cop you see on american movies  perhaps copied too much  i would describe this movie as ordinary american thriller with a little bit of turkish touch  unfortunately yet again i m convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in turkish cinema anyways i gave this movie a   its too boring and full of clich s
