well ok  i ve seen wrath of the ninja   it isn t something that i would recommend to people who aren t seriously into japanese fighting movies  this is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie  with a complex plot  it s about these   old ninja schools that had these    swords of sorcery  i saw the subtitled version  not recommended by the way  it s easy to miss something  and i didn t really keep up with it all  it had some good scenes tough  but in general  it wasn t much to my liking
