michael allred s comic book stories  particularly his work on madman  usually are a great deal of fun   astroesque  allred s no budget indy film  is the opposite of fun   worst acting ever coupled with truly horrible dialog makes for a brutal cinematic experience  pretty certain allred understands wtf s going on  but he s the only one  daring you to watch the entire mess isn t enough defying you to watch the entire mess is more on target    astroesque  is some kind of movie tie in to allred s  red rocket   comic book  which  ironically  is mostly unreadable  so if your  astroesque  experience isn t terrible enough definitely track down the over sized comics and continue the fun   felt sorry for allred  who was totally out of his depth attempting a film  also felt sorry for myself  what an incredible waste of my time and money  please buy my vhs copy  which is available right now on ebay  hurry up
