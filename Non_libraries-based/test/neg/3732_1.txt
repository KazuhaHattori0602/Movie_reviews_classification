j j  jameson  from spiderman   quote   crap  crap     mega crap it pretends to be an homage  un intentional  to the coen brothers   done poorly   there is no real mystery to the plot   diaz s performance is totally uninspired   the quirky characters don t really work   there are a lot of  duh  moments   i love black comedy  but this film isn t funny   in my view  it wasn t worth the electricity   there are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining   i hope you find this review helpful
