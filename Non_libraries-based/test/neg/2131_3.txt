i wish i had something more positive to say about devil fish  but i honestly can t seem to come up with much  i can t even come up with many of those  so bad  it s good  kind of moments  devil fish is just plain old bad  the plot is completely derivative  jaws  anyone  the acting is wooden  the characters are uninteresting  the special effects are beyond bad  and the score is annoying  add to that the seemingly inept direction of lamberto bava and you ve got one stinker of a movie  i think  however  that the film s biggest sin is its lack of a budget  it doesn t appear that bava had much to work with  by   the italian film industry was in full decline   especially as far as genre films go  the funding available to bava was most probably very meager  film s like devil fish that rely on special effects just never had a chance to be good  it s not the only italian film to suffer this fate  there are a number of italian movies made in the mid s whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could realistically have expected given their budgetary limitations    however  having said all that and noting the film s many weaknesses  i can t bring myself to rate devil fish lower than a   i ve even considered rating it higher but can t because i realize how bad a movie it is  why don t i rate it lower  well that s hard to explain  despite the many problems found in the movie  there s something about devil fish that i inexplicably enjoy  it could be as simple as my love for low budget  cheesy  italian movies  maybe my taste in movies is horribly skewed  but i enjoy what i enjoy   the mystery science theater   treatment of devil fish is actually very enjoyable  i rate devil fish a   on my mst k rating scale  the guys do a fine job of poking fun at the movie s many flaws  one very astute observation comes very early in the commentary when tom servo notes   just because you can edit  doesn t mean you should    highlighting yet another of the many weaknesses to be found in devil fish
