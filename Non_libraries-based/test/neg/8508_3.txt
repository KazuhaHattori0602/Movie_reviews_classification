first off  i am a huge fan of tolkien  and as one i will base most of my critic on his books   the movie is a standard adventure movie  well made with nifty special effects  nice sound track and fine acting  now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn t be half this good as they are here   the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from tolkiens books but then it goes and  hollywoods  everything it can  numerous scenes from the book are eighter missing or changed quite a lot  the characters are changed from the book also  a thing that i think should be punishable   what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it  i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book  and it didn t work here eighter  mostly the motivation of the characters is left hazy at best   as a adventure movie it would rate       as a adaptation of tolkien it rates        i mean honestly  what on earth was arwen doing at rivendell ford   and as for the comments that this movie  is the best ever  i can only say that eighter you are very young  or you havent seen good movies   peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings
