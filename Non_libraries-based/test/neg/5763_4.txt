 curse of the forty niner  doesn t really deserve a long and detailed review  so i ll just make some random observations about it     cool opening credits     no plot     is there anyone who s ever seen a horror film before and can t guess  within the first   minutes  who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes     hey  that newcomer  alexandra ford  is pretty hot     richard lynch  made up to look about   years old  and john phillip law have fun  tongue in cheek cameos     karen black has a bigger role  but she s not fun   she s rather embarrassing     martin kove is on screen for about   seconds  but still got his name on the video cover  did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around      i hate cheap computer generated effects in horror films     out of
