this film could of been a hell of a lot better if they didn t use brian conley as a gangster and if they didn t start the film with christopher biggins   when i watched this film i had absolutely no idea what was going on  there were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable  the film deserves a   but seeing as i there isn t a   i gave it a    i wouldn t recommend this film to my worst enemy  i would rather poke out my eyeballs with some rusty scissors than watch this film again  i m telling you  that was an hour and a half of my life i won t get back   if you want to watch a gangster film  don t get this  watch  going off big time  or  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  instead
