this story starts at the end   so the film s opening credits advise us  unfortunately that s not true as we then are treated to around   minutes of a typical b science fiction movie of the  s  the story is dreary  the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget  as was often the case in those days   the story could have covered any situation where people are taking refuge in an isolated house and being threatened by someone outside  it just happened to be adapted to fit round a sci fi story   the scenery consisted of a few rocks  bushes  and smoke    oh yes there was a pool of water as well  someone wore a rubber mask with a beak like face and what looked like feathers   written by lou rusoff  who penned several sci fi stories around that time including the she creature and it conquered the world the filming was completed in a matter of days  not allowing the actors time to develop their characters to better advantage  the low budget restraints also prevented this film reaching its potential  it could have been a much better film than it turned out to be   mike connors and richard denning brought some life to the film  but even they could not lift this film into the category where you could say   i enjoyed that film  richard denning s acting career began in   he starred with gregory peck and deborah kerr in an affair to remember and later became more well known on television in the series hawaii five o and the flying doctor series   directed by roger corman who has many films to his credit both as a director and producer  he has made some good films and is still making them  he became very well known for his direction of films from the stories of edgar allan poe  often starring vincent price  he also made other low budget films  some were good and entertaining for one reason or another  and most were much better than this   i would not recommend this film to anyone   darnmay    th september
