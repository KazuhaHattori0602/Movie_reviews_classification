this is a great example of what happened at comedy central after dave chapelle left  here s the problem with carlos mencia  firstly  his birth name is ned holness  and was known that until he was   when he switched his name to ned arnel mencia  he was born in honduras  though he acts like he s from mexico  he grew up in the united states  as well   i might be able to forgive all that crap  but   he s been caught stealing other peoples material  joe rogan has been his most vocal critic in this way  the stereotype olympics was an idea he ripped off a couple of dj s from miami  he has stolen jokes from bill cosby  he stole george lopez s material in his own hbo special   minutes of it   he thinks what he s doing is so original  but dave chapelle and lisa lampanelli have been cracking on race for years before this idiot  amoung others   this show will crash and burn  the word beaner can t last that long before it gets old  he hasn t done anything new since the first episode    wanna hear a joke  a beaner jumping a fence  that s funny for   seasons  not   awful
