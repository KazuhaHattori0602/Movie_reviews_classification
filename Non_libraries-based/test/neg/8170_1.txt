this movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of indian society  what it tries to show you is only one side of the story  the other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of indian children which this movie does not show    indian parents  are culpable for the following  a  destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age  such children grow up to be adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds  since everything has been provided to them by their great indian parents  they children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parents   b  i can show you so many indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends  going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adults   the reason why they do is the same selfishness  indian parents  expect  their children to take care of them when they grow old  they do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of  they cry out loud we have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the great service of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weak   most of the indian parents at the age of   have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure  most feel that they absolutely have no need to take care of themselves since they  expect  their kids to take care of them   in the west the opposite of that happens  people start planning at the age of   about their retirement and once they retire they are financially secure   indian parents do nothing of that sort since like i said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at that   i am a victim of my indian parents  i am sure there are countless other indian kids like me  who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on their own and they continue to have pestering   year olds who cry out loud for help all the time   this movie shows only one side of the story utter piece of junk
