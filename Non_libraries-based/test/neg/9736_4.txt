despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the  th century  erwin rommel is generally well regarded by historians and world war ii buffs as a gentleman  a soldier s soldier  and a brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare  if only hitler had given him the troops and materiel he had desired in africa  the argument goes  things would have gone very differently  and that s probably true  rommel was  in fact  a military genius  and by all accounts an upstanding  honest man   but this film goes out of its way to portray him as a near saint  he does his job  trying to win the war for hitler  but constantly the fuhrer interferes and gives him ridiculous orders  which rommel  james mason  expresses amazement with but rarely actually questions and never  ever disobeys  only when it s patently obvious that hitler is leading germany to ruin does rommel think of treason against him  this dilemma plays out as the main theme of the film  a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing   mason is fine as rommel  but it s hardly a memorable performance along the lines of  say  george c  scott as patton  of course  rommel wasn t as colorful as patton  but this film is so intent on making him look like a decent human being that it forgets to make him interesting  he occasionally lapses into some warmth when with his wife lucie  a young jessica tandy  well cast  but usually mason is called upon to give a stiff british performance   as if the brits were trying to claim rommel for themselves  though in all fairness all the nazis have english accents except hitler   done on the cheap  with any battle scenes swiping stock footage  and the beaches of southern california doubling for tunisia  there s nothing to particularly recommend this film  a remake could be interesting  i d pick ed harris only because of a slight physical resemblance and  well  harris can act  were it spiced up a little  but this movie mostly demonstrated to me how much more demanding we as viewers have become in the last fifty years  a biography this bland would never cut it any more
