this  in my opinion  is a very poor movie that advertises arnold schwarzenegger as starring  despite him being the co star  only to sell more copies  obviously taking influence from the similarly themed  conan  movies  this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all   bridgette neilsen stars as sonja  a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged  her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of queen gedran  sandahl bergman  gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by sonja s sister to do it  after discovering what has happened sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of gedran  kalidor  schwarzenegger  the master of the talisman  sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not   the first major problem with this movie is the beginning  the events leading up to the point where sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film  however  the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one minute `previously on
  segment from a television show  had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn t  i wonder why director richard fleischer has only currently directed two movies since red sonja   this film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like tarn  ernie reyes jr  who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie  which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably  he was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for  red sonja   for all it s faults there were some good fight scenes involving both neilsen and arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey  the acting is about as good as it gets for movies of this quality and even arnie didn t seem too bothered about his performance  i don t recommend this film at all  to me it s a waste of an hour and a half  my rating for  red sonja
