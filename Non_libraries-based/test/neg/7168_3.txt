oh god  book ii is more of a bad remake of the original than a sequel to it it is not all that funny its plot plays too much  like a rejected situation comedy pilot and the use of the slogan  think god  is a different variation on the idea that worked so much better in the original john denver had not returned for this movie and that made a big difference george burns as  wonderful as he was playing god does not have the same chemistry with the little girl that he did with john denver   i would give this movie a rating of   out of  but only for  george burns the rest of the cast is nothing special   if you loved the first one don t bother to see this one
