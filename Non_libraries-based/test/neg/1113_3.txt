if you described any of the scenes  nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep  your infant daughter talking to ghosts  searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night  so petrified with fear that you can t move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above   then i d say you had a horror movie  but some how  wicked little things  just wasn t scary  i am a horror fan and i loved the location  the plot in principal and i liked the three leading ladies  i didn t want to see them come to harm  i wanted the  bad guy  to get his just desserts  the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so i was indifferent either way with them and it played out every clich  in the book   even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you   i would still recommend that you watch it  but unless you are new to horror movies or under   years  you will have seen it all before
