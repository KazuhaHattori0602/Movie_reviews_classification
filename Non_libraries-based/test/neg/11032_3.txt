taran adarsh a reputed critic praised such a dubba movie  the film has a weird story wherein a lover sells his love to a brothel cos he wants money to save his mother and then also gets forgived for it lol  the movie is crap  the entire first half has it s focus on romance  comedy which fails to work the twist shocks but the entire second half is a mess and the climax is clich d  direction by aditya datt is bad music is typical himesh  emraan does his serious role well but his wardrobe  his way of walking through songs etc is similar to his previous films geeta bhasra annoys ashmith patel fails to convince this actor was good in murder only so far and then a downhill mithun some screen time and he is okay but his breaking down into a song is forced ranjeet is okay
