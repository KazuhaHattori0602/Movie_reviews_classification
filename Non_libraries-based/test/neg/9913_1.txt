anyone who complains about peter jackson making movies too long should sit through this cbs  event  there s about   minutes of story padded by   hours of unnecessary subplots  featuring bland by the book tv drama clich s  bad science is a staple for crappy weather disaster movies  so i m not going to complain about that  silly science can be fun to watch if it s executed in an amusing fashion  what kills this movie is it s   subplots  all of which could be excised without destroying what is supposed to be the central plot  the one character that is entertaining to watch in category   is tornado tommy  despite being a very annoying stereotype   note that i also didn t bother commenting on special effects  their quality should come as no surprise   not recommended
