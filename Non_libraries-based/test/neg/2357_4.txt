human traffic is purely a `been there  done that  experience   only this time it s quite limp   major themes explored are paranoia  male impotence and jealousy   but only mildly and poorly   a lot of the movie seems to want to imitate trainspotting  drug   `clubbing  culture    but it fails to include the low times   come downs that trainspotting deals with  eg  issues with death   dependence  etc  it even tries to come up with a similar monologue to ewan mcgreggor s classic `choose life  speech   but `the milky bars are on me  yeah    what the fudge is that all about   the characters try to analyse their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so shallow   their analysis becomes boring and repetitious   the soundtrack  for a movie that is trying to be cool  is pathetic  it includes the likes of fat boy slim and cj bolland   come on people   good dance music is be better than this   the characters become grating and annoying  especially half way through the movie  and the lack of care for the characters soon dawns   there are a couple of funny scenes   but they are few and far between  the mother catching the son in the bedroom was quite amusing   but please   i m sick to death of the star wars analogy scenes  i thought it was much more sharper in a couple of kevin smith s movies  ie  clerks and chasing amy  according to the characters   yoda is a drug fiend hence that s why he is short and bald   huh   my score     out of     do yourself a favour and see trainspotting or go instead
