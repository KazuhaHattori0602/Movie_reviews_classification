pinocchio s revenge is not a good movie  nor is it terrible   the acting was wooden at least on pinocchio s part the puppet had all of   expressions as did most of the actors except strangely enough the secondary characters most of them were enjoyable over the top   the special effects in this are pretty  b  and as i said earlier the puppet really blew   the   best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand looked pretty good i think they spent about a   of the budget on that and the shower scene wow i think they must have spent the other  rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it outstanding   seriously this is a slightly below average  b  horror puppet movie rent chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill   the story had a few interesting idea s  enough to keep me watching it to the end
