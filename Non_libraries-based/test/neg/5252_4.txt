the future of fantasy never looked so dark  christopher lambert gets to fight the evil demon grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy epos   epos  i said  er  there s only one location  so you can t really call it an epic adventure  can you  the location is a medieval futuristic   inch tall castle  so how did they manage to cram in all the actors  oh  i get it  those where special effects  a miniature  silly me   here s some reasons why you might want or not want to watch this motion picture     lambert gets to do his sword swinging tricks over again like he did in highlander     the sets and costumes are amazingly cool  if you re a  year old     rhona mitra has a voluptuous pair of knockers which she likes to show off through out the whole movie      er  christopher lambert has white hair     every time they start fighting  this over the top raving techno soundtrack gets going  so why are these medieval slayer dudes fighting while they should be dancing     they don t have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed which seem to work fine  so where s the amplifier  i guess they borrowed it from the techno dj who delivered the soundtrack     watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous demono d cgi creature coming straight out of any playstation   survival horror game   if all this got you interested  then go watch it  at your own risk  but don t tell anyone i told you to  i strongly suspect pinhead visiting the set while shooting  because this movie has no soul  anyway  if you want to see beautiful rohna mitra really show some skin  then watch paul verhoeven s hollow man
