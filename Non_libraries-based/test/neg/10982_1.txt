it s awful   pretty succinct review i know  but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state   wondering how the hell a film like that gets made   the last time it happened was last years turkey  mission to mars   salvatore coco is an ex con   trying to better himself through self help videos  endless seminars and betterment courses  he lives by the catchphrases these courses expound   he stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer  played by nikki bennett  and has an epiphany  his new career is going to be that of a talent agent   with the singer as his one and only client   financed by his gospel singing  paraplegic girlfriend  played by sasha horler   he sets up shop and tries to relaunch nikki s career  with disastarous results    walk the talk  is the reason why australians are so contemptuous of australian cinema  it is poorly constructed  lame and way wayyy too long   minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the   minute mark   every scene is too long  and are very repetitive  the audience is not given a character to empathise with  a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an  underdog  giving it a go   the downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of   minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure   this film is a failure on all levels   made worse for queensland audiences by its liberal and innacurate use of various gold coast palm beach location  and its laughable use of brisbane suburb names like norman park and caboolture
