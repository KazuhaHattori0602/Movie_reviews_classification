i saw this movie years about   years ago when it first came out  and the only memories that i have about it are     that it was awful    that in one scene linnea quigley applies suntan lotion to her arms and legs repeatedly for about   minutes straight  it seemed that long anyways    one scene where a character gets a sledgehammer rammed into his head  in this scene  when the hammer connects  the head smashes like glass  it s quite bad
