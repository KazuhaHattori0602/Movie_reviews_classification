if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors  eating non ants  and conquering the world with a voice over narrative  then this is the movie for you  basically  a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants  the most intelligent actors in this film  in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination  throughout the movie the two scientists  and a girl they rescued from the ants  use everything at their disposal  computers  green dye  and horrid acting  but to no avail  i guess they just couldn t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly   the title of the movie  phase iv  is something of a mystery  this is not a spoiler  but  phase i  starts right after the opening credits whereas you don t reach  phase iv  until the end credits roll  apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases       throughout the movie as a kind of progress report   hang in there buddy  only   more phase until final credits  as a mst k episode  this one wasn t very good for two reasons    this one is from the season   on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons  and   this movie is so bad not even j tb can lighten it up  there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing   gamera movies   the movie does have a trick surprise ending  but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me
