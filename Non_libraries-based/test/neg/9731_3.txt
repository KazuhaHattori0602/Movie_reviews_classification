let me say first off i didn t go in expecting much  and watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped  i believe it would have  had there been more than   people in the theater    it sucked so hard  the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last   minutes of the movie  i guess that was their way of twisting the plot  keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plot   unknowns until the end of the movie   what the eff is a dark ling  the cg was cool but i want to understand   why cant powers be willed  especially if mass murder is the ultimatum   why is willing away powers so bad  your just normal after  right   who farted   roughly   of the minutes with just men on screen  were shots of them in wife beaters  sleeveless t s and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured  i swear you could see the start of the one guys  well  it was close to soft core  and of course there was a shower scene  and to mix it up it was of the dudes  butt cracks were abundant  a sausage fest in progress  but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around   minutes  then there was a girl talk pj party  the other thing i couldn t get over was the amount of driving that caleb did in his super cool ford mustang gt  it was a ford commercial for around  th of the movie   don t see it  or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies  then it could be worth it  but don t expect anything breathtaking
