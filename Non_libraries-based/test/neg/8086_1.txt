this movie  quite literally  does not have one redeeming feature  the characters are one dimensional  cliched  incredibly misogynistic and stupid  the script looks as if it was cobbled together from   other movies  the acting is horrible  and some of the  gross out  humour made me feel nauseous   shame on you  gregory poirier  for thinking any of this would be funny or interesting   the worst movie i ve seen in several years
