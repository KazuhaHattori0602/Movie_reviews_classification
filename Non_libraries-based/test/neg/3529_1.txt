hi y all   i bought this on dvd from england  you see  i have one of those multi region players  i thought it would be fun to get a cool movie to show to my friends  well  surprise to amy jo johnson  she s barely in the movie  although she is on the cover  it s really difficult to imagine how a film this bad got made in the first place  perhaps someone has a trust fund   oh  it s about vampires who live at the beach
