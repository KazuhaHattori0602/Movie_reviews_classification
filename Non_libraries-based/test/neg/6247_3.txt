hmmmmmmm   cheerleader massacre  let me think   high school girls get sliced up  except the cute one survives  got it  next movie   i was actually surprised this one was made in   i really thought they quit making these movies in the  s  this was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy  dumb male horn dogs  even dumber male adult  and hot teacher  it continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods  we have seen it all before   however this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me too slashers  so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and   hours to kill   you could do worse
