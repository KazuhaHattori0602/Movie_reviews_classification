i too am a house party fan house party i is my favorite movie of all times  house party   is a disgrace to all of the hp s and to kid n play this was supposed to be part of a series really there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a house party movie b c its kind of focused on teens but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance   you can tell how good it was b c it didn t even make it to the movie theaters  immature was in house party   so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy but they should have represented right they should have left it at house party   i am   years old and i have been watching house party i since i was   when it came out in   years ago  and i have been a fan ever since  when i first seen house party   i was like what are they really thinking about there was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous   movies  i thought it was a black ferris bueller days off
