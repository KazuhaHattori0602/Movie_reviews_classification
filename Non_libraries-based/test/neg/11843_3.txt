i bought a dvd collection   movies for   euros  where this one was included  it turned out to be the  uncut version  whatever that means  beside the low average quality and short scenes there was one thing that was really strange   the soft sex scene  it started with a close up of   bigger breasts  after around   minutes i had an expression on my face which fitted the term  boooooooooooooring  quite perfectly    minutes of not even bouncing concrete like tits  at this point the term breasts is a bad choice  is far beyond from entertainment   the rest of the movie was more like  people aren t  that  stupid  are they    lucky me  the dvd was scratched and i got my money back
