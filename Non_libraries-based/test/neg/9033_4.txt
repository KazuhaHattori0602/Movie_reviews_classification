so seagal plays a dea detective named john hatcher who lost his partner on a drug investigation into  surprise surprise  colombia  not to brag or anything  but my father was born and raised in colombia  hence my last name  and now he s a doctor in california  so no matter what the movies would have you believe  there are some things other than drug dealers and cocaine that come out of colombia   at any rate  in a drug bust gone bad  hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked colombian prostitute  inspiring him to go to confession  somewhere that i have never seen him go before in any of his movies  before or since  it was actually pretty interesting  seagal has a tendency to come off as almost asexual the way he never gets much involved with women other than as a plot device and the way the occasional seduction attempt  whether by a stripper or by a lover  never piques the slightest bit of interest from him  he s all get the  bad guys all the time    but in the confession booth  he confesses to having lied  sold drugs  falsified evidence  and even slept with informants in order to get the information he needed to put the bad guys behind bars  i hope i m not getting in trouble with god by telling you this
  the priest tells him to go to his family  so he decides it s time to retire from the force    the next third of the movie is an exercise in the paper thin characterization characteristic of seagal s films  marked for death is the story of seagal against a band of mystic jamaican drug dealers  and these guys have no discretions about pushing their products in broad daylight   hatcher goes back to visit his old high school coach  max  a minimal effort by keith david  and right in the middle of practice there are some of these dread locked crackheads sitting right there in the bleachers peddling crack to some bookworm looking high school girls   maybe i just had a sheltered experience in high school  but i didn t know crack dealers and crackheads hung out at school in the middle of the day  at any rate  it s not long before hatcher learns how evil these guys are  they re not just peddling crack to high school kids  but the coach has been losing football players regularly to their drugs  they engage in smartass stare downs with max  and since that s not enough  his  year old niece died in their crackhouse   ah  ok  we get the picture  i m sure they also torture puppies and beat up old women  and maybe steal candy from children too  just for good measure  is it really this hard to establish who the bad guys are   year old niece died in their crackhouse  wow   anyway  not only does the movie not know how to develop villains without resorting to what basically boils down to movie name calling  where evil deeds are shallowly assigned to them through dialogue  but they also don t know how they should act    the leader of the drug dealers  is named screwface  and i suppose that alone should tell you something about the kind of movie this is  screwface is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright  bizarrely green eyes  which i am guess must be an important part of his character because he spends a good majority of his screen time with his eyes half bulging out of his head  his favorite means of intimidation is to scream really loud in his wildly overblown jamaican accent with his face quite literally less than an inch away from whoever he s yelling at  this guy likes to get so into guys  faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don t touch  all i could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath   man  they do not want you to forget that these guys are jamaican  by the way  their accents are so exaggerated and overblown that for most of the movie it s nearly impossible to understand them  not that it matters  it doesn t matter what they re saying  all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouths is some kind of evil drug related thing  they re just the psychos that peddle drugs and kill people  the movie must have been a huge hit in jamaica   my biggest problem with the movie is that the theatrics  particularly of the bad guys  as i ve described  are spectacularly goofy  even for a seagal film  they are so cartoonish and weird that it s impossible to take them as anything other than a goofball b movie creation  something slapped together to provide fodder to whom seagal can distribute his characteristic brand of smack down retribution    but there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the movie that just makes it all come off as weird  for example  a mystic  i guess you would call her  at one point puts some kind of curse on screwface by  if i remember correctly  spitting mouthfuls of bacardi onto a live rooster that s hanging upside down before beheading it and dripping its blood onto a picture of screwface  hmm  interesting    sadly  it s this same woman that warns hatcher that his family has been  marked for death  by these people  meaning they ve got some voodoo hex on them  not to belittle anyone  but if i was told that my family had been cursed by people like that  i would just laugh at it  hatcher doesn t strike me as the kind of guy to take much stock in freaky voodoo curses    but the set up  as you can see  is pretty standard for a seagal film  unique villains  i guess you could say  although not very impressive  definitely the weirdest film of seagal s early career
