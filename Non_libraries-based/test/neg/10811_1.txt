that s how i was when i walked  staggered  out of this  film  i couldn t leave  because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people  i was stuck in the middle  trapped   the tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen  the daughter was a stand out performance   stand out in the bad sense   thge cinematography was hideous  consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting i ve witnessed   as for the stock footage  well at first one   wait   why am i reviewing this film  why do i acknowledge its existence  please  don t watch it  do something useful with two hours of your life and go watch some paint dry
