i am a huge fan of the farcry game  huge fan  it still holds a place in my top  games list of all time  the story line was new  fresh  a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on  or so i thought   farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise  see doom  the movie  and many more   the video game begins as the player  jack carver  awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier  jack then finds a communication device where  harlan doyle  guides him across islands  shipwrecks  jungles  installations and volcanoes  to find his  lady friend   valerie constantine  all the wile battling mutated super soldiers  and genetically enhanced animals   the movie plays out very  very differently    there s a needless   mins   of the movie  of  backstory  before we even get to the  boat blowing up  scene    jack then walks onto the beach  kills some goons  then drives off  nothing like the game    there is no communicator with doyle on the other end    the  modified soldiers  look like albinos with singlets on  and there was no mutated  monkey like  creatures jumping out of the bushes  a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot    there is no sun filled beach scenes  no aircraft carrier  no communications stations on huge cliffs  little reference to any in game contents  characters items vehicles  in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all    the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building    there s an ending scene  where everyone  except krieger  live happily ever after  what the   i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs  if you are a gamer  you will hate this movie will all your soul  it is a movie clearly intended for males  so girls  stay away  so if your a male    years of age  have never played farcry  and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books games to the cinema  then this is for you
