in terms of historical accuracy  this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen  the list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three hour film  but just to give you an idea   julius caesar and augustus are presented as liberal democrats  taking the side of  the people  against  the nobles  this is patently absurd  the caesars were as noble as you could get  their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by   years of civil war  there had been reformers  notably the gracchi brothers  who lived about   years earlier  and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens   there are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous  if you know anything about the period   cleopatra  with richard burton  will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded  fanciful though it is   historical accuracy is one thing  acting and dialogue are something else  and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production  i burst out laughing several times  especially when julia  the daughter of augustus  meets a lover  they clutch passionately  as she breathes   my father   ah  your father  your father  your father would disapprove  peter o toole is at his worst  forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines  the actor who plays augustus as a young man is such a nebbish   and the character is written as such   it s impossible to envision him as the cunning  crafty  machiavellian politician who created the roman empire  here  he s just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time   charlotte rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as livia  augustus s wife  with dignity  had she been given a fuller role to play  she might have rescued this production from absurdity   there is some nice photography and battle footage  helped by plenty of standard issue cgi  oddly  this was made for british tv  and appears to be a british italian co production  but is labeled with an  r  rating   the dvd picture is excellent and the dolby digital soundtrack is very nice  although you only notice it during the few action sequences  as the movie is mostly talk   almost any roman movie  even  cleopatra  or  the fall of the roman empire  has more historicity   to say nothing of compelling drama   than this bizarre classics illustrated  jr  adaptation  this one gives new meaning to the much abused phrase   based on a true story  in this case they could have said   suggested by real events
