the storyline seemed fine  the actors seemed fine  the movie should  have been fine  but it sure wasn t   it didn t lead us anywhere  the  scenes are weird  maybe it was meant to create something new  to make  us think  that atleast it did  where is the rest of this film  to me it  was waste of money  time  and talent  someone might want to see this  for curiosity  to see if they can figure it out  other i personally  wouldn t recommend this to anyone
