egads   i used to think keannu reeves was the worst actor in hollywood  i not so sure anymore  willy gives keannu some stiff competition with his  i m made of plaster  performance in this movie   combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot  and not a single likable character  and it s pretty hard to recommend this turkey   natasha tries her best  but even julia roberts couldn t save this flick from obscurity   avoid it unless it s really late and there s nothing else on   oh heck  in that case just read a book
