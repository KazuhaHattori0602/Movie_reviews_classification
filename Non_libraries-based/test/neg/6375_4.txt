don t get me wrong  the guy s a success dynamo  but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats  so i get a little peeved when he looks at comic book fans as an extension of that same market   see   the invincible iron man  wouldn t be bad if it were slotted on a saturday morning and geared exclusively toward undiscerning children  but it s not directed exclusively at children  periphery characters are killed every five minutes and there s enough bloodshed and semi nude bodies to make network censors squirm  so it isn t quite cut out for children s television   so what audience is this video aiming for then  it s the audience that enjoys nigh intelligible story lines about reviving a tyrannical chinese emperor with   arcane rings  that s who  and i think that audience is restrictively small   a lot of great writers have passed through marvel s leathery yoni over the decades  so it s a shame that marvel would risk their pricey animation investments on so many questionable storytellers and scribes who  like mr  arad  are better accustomed to peddling action figures during saturday morning cartoons  how many lukewarm receptions do marvel have to endure before they come up with a better strategy       animation  just passable cels  some segments are better than others  a low budget look all throughout   this ain t no bakshi  ralph  and it ain t no bluth  don  cg animation s okay  but far from impressive   story  a litany of clich s  all over the place  convoluted  contrived  and uninspired   characters  so why is rhodes even here if all he does is add to stark s sexual ambiguity  hmmm  her dad s in a wheelchair  tony misses his mom  asian chicks are hot and  apparently  little else  the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the feature s end   performances  can t blame competent voice actors for a bad script   art  very western musculature  very clean lines  faces are very derivative of eastern art  very boring mattes  very bland cg   conclusion  not great  but worth a watch for the fans and those who enjoy superhero myths  a  must buy  for collectors  a valuable  what not to do  course for junior animators
