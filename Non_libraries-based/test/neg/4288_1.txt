terrible psychological thriller that is almost painful to sit through  every aspect being awful   the combined talents of top actors kevin bacon and gary oldman are totally wasted  and though they give good performances  one wonders why they bothered  the script from mark kasdan is a complete mess  and martin campbell has the narrative jumping all over the place  but if you re unable to follow it  take it as a blessing  there are far too many pointless  crazy scenes that just don t make sense  jerry goldsmith s music is not much help either   even if there was potential in the plot  director campbell s approach has utterly ruined it  avoid at all costs   monday  february       video
