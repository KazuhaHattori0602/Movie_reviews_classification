the movie was supposed to release in   and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in   after the producer died  the movie is good in parts but overall isn t great  the scenes between rani and ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled  the film is too similar to bollywood hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost  milan luthria disappoints overall after kachche daage  music is good but too many songs  ajay devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too rani is good sonali is good too rest are okay
