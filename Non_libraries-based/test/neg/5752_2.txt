for many months i was looking forward to this release  the previews looked good  early reports on the net were encouraging  and golden eye and timesplitters were excellent shooters  by the same people  it turns out i was greatly misled  haze had the potential to be up there with call of duty   and other next gen shooters  however it looks  plays and feels like something from   years or so ago  i played haze on a   tv and was initially disappointed that the game s developers had limited the graphics to   the haze universe lacks detail and atmosphere  the feeling of  they must have really rushed to finish this  is always there   the controls are sluggish and cumbersome  and i have yet to find an adjustment for x y axis sensitivity   there are many parts of the single player game that are very dark  visually  to the point where you can t actually see where you are going  why not add a torch function like in halo  or even better  night vision  the use of the performance enhancing drug  nectar  is interesting  however just as you get used to it you switch sides and don t use it again  why bother  i could go on with many more haze faults  but instead i ll just say don t bother  wait for killzone   or play call of duty   and try to unlock the gold ak
