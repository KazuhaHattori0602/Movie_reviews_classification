this movie doesn t even deserve a   this movie was a scam   i swear that at least   minutes of the film were deliberetly copied from carnosaur        the whole movie  raptor  was based of the movie and that was really a pathetic attempt to be a  thriller  action packed  dinosaur  copy  i loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that cant even afford or willing copy it without doing there own models is what america is coming to i recommend you see the carnosaur movie first  all of them  and then watch this  and you will know what i mean     spencer
