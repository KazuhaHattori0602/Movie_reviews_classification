rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains  more or less  acceptable
bloodline is a rather short  which is a good thing in this case  escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box  who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it  we re introduced to   generations of the merchant family  all played by bruce ramsey  one in  th century paris  one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far  far away
 opinions on this storyline may differ a lot
either you think it s very idiotic and far fetched or
original and dared  the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished  yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling  hellraiser  bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead  doug bradley  still is an extra horror value  pinhead   accompanied by a pet puppy this time   still knows how to kill
too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly  best aspects in this production are the newly introduced `cenobites  and the occult parisian portrait  giant turn offs are the weak script  the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barker s initial masterpiece    although not highly memorable itself  bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film  after this sequel  the series went downhill completely  so far    more sequels came out   more are still in process  and neither of those is worth seeing  hellraiser bloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smithee
meaning he doesn t want to be remembered as the director of it  who could blame him
