laughable   clich d   overdoses on style to compensate for poor writing   remember when mtv actually used to air music videos and other shows besides reality shows  aeon flux   is based upon one such show   a cartoon from the mid s   featuring a superhuman female protagonist in black latex clothing  aeon  played by the lovely charlize theron in this adaptation  is a cold detached rebel who is as dexterous as a line dancer and as deadly as a viper snake  she needs to be  if she expects to kick the asses of the totalitarian government   i love science fiction  but hate the sudden influx of half assed futuristic dystopian technology overdosed films like the island   and equilibrium    bottom of the pile  aeon flux has all the problems that are present in these films  but amplified  that is  there is nothing original left to show so they compensate for it with the sleek style that matrix   catalyzed  the special effects are therefore sensational in aeon flux which earns it a few points  but scratch the surface and there is literally nothing there   to make matters worse  all performances in this film are atrocious and some actually wound me to watch  charlize theron s character aeon flux is interwoven with the most cheesy tough chick schtick and it seems as though the director karyn kusama cannot quite decide where to go with her next   should she make her more detached or more emotional  she doesn t know  let s go both ways  imagine you take a shotgun  load it chock full of character developments of different sorts and there fire into a random mess  this is the character of aeon flux   the film aeon flux puts forward all the  mandatory  ideas in a dystopian society   individual vs  society  nature vs  science  emotion vs  cold reason  etc  you ve seen all of this before  and better done at that  go read orwell  bradbury or huxley  or even watch logan s run   or blade runner   anything  avoid this viciously uninvolving cheese fest for as long as you can
