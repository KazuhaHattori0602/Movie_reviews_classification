though not a complete waste of time   eighteen  really wasn t all sweet as it pretended to be  nor are the ages of the actors they re portraying     my butt  mckellen could have actually shown up in the film telling us he was   and ask us to believe it  even michael j  fox was more believable as a teen in  back to the future  parts ii and iii  okay  maybe not  they re probably equal believability  if you can get past the obvious age flaw  you ll have either the complete void of acting or simply overacting  paul anthony s so called anguish  clarence sponagle s lifetime moments  and even though i do favor brendan fletcher  it s best to just watch him  and more  in  freddy vs  jason  incomprehensible scenes  a faster than britney spears marriage  incest to prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate  but still has one hand free   i m guessing this was the writer s fantasy  an entire movie of despicable characters  anthony might be playing someone that s   but acts like he s   and some odd  john  thrown in so anthony s character pip can save the day   was there really a sex scene in front of a baby  and practically every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions scenes  on the positive side  i did enjoy ian mckellen s voice over  seeing a  rarely well portrayed  straight gay friendship  puppy love  from someone who collects stuffed puppies  that is  good score  some decent dialogue  love the separation of gays and pedophilia   wish more people would realize that  and acting from the female leads  as well as cumming  i can t really recommend it as it s really trying to be too many things   gay tolerance  gay hustling  homelessness  wwii epic  priesthood  first love  flawed judges  etc  etc  etc   on a shoestring budget
