the tv show was slow moving and the  offbeat  characters were sometimes irritating  only through the miracle of fast forward was i able to make it through the first   hours    the write up indicates that it s some kind of comedy mystery but i didn t see much of either    if it really picks up after the first   hours  please let me know  because i doubt that i will watch the rest without a recommendation   this review is supposed to be without spoilers so i will continue in a vague  non spoiler  fashion  i found the two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic  i found myself asking  would a normal adult do that  the man with the hedge trimmer looking out the window was irritating and when the male lead interacted with him  he looked pathetic  would a normal adult put up with someone as irritating as him
