being a huge street fighter fan and thoroughly enjoying the previous film  street fighter ii  the animated movie  i was really looking forward to this one   however  it seemed that the film had no real sense of direction or purpose  most of the characters i could not associate with and it just lacked the intense action that made the other mentioned street fighter film so superior   there are some good points however  the animation is superb
