i see that c  thomas howell has appeared in many movies since his heyday in the  s as an accomplished young actor   i bought this dvd because it was cheap and in part for the internet related plot and to see how much older c  thomas howell is  i do not recall seeing him in any movies since the  s   in just a few words  what a very big disappointment  i give some low budget movies a chance  but this one started out lame  within the first   minutes of the movie  this elusive woman is chatting with an asian guy in a chatroom  they basically stimulate themselves to their own chat  she then insists on meeting the participant in person  she meets him  has sex  ties him up and then murders him in cold blood  the plot then deteriorates further   the plot is thin and flimsy and the acting is very stiff  do not bother renting it much less purchasing it  even if it is in the   dvd bin  i plan to take my copy of the dvd to goodwill  i am truly amazed that any of the prior reviewers here gave this movie a bad rating
