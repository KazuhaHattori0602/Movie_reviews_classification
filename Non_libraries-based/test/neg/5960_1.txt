you want the worst horror movie of the  st century  el chupacabra is it   manos the hands of fate  is the worst movie of all time  but el chupacabra certainly is the worst movie of this century  it also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever  eric alegria  the actor in the lead role  has never done another film other than el chupacabra  gee   i wonder why   apparently the monster is attacking people  but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid  and  there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives   hello  cops show up on the scene of homicides first  then the detectives come  and  apparently the monster only attacks in one person s backyard  and some deserted area by the docks  or thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film   this  film  is the reason why imdb must allow us to give negative stars  this easily deserves   stars  or at least   they should allow a   rating
