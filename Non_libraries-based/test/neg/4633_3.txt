i m rating  the decline of the american empire  just about below average since it wasn t terrible  but also not great  i liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out  that was probably the most original aspect   a dialogue laced sexual small film with people who are extremely far from models  that aside  it seems ironic that these french speaking canadians have a movie about a neighboring society that  well  is in  decline  when their own actions are their own demise  a group of women friends and male friends spend half the movie laughing it up on their infidelities and acceptance of such behavior and the other half  intellectually  speaking of how powerful they are for their speech and actions  these are the normal targets in typical sitcoms the main characters make fun of at parties occupied mainly by college professors  sadly  it s not their  intelligence  or mastery of  history  that disturbs me  it s their pedestal made of ego and mightier than thou attitude that pushes me away and not one character could i relate to  nor like  when one cries  i couldn t care less   it s your bed  when one complains  i barely flinched  what made me skirmish was one character  uh  peeing red   another example of playing with fire  sure  i understand it happens to some people  but it was hard to watch  and i sincerely hoped the he washed his hands as he had no problem going right back to cooking for everyone  on the complete opposite end of the noses up educators  they introduce a stereotypical nomad  this made me cringe as no one seemed real  everyone was as shallow as their laughter on society  unfortunately  with no one left to root for  you re left as empty as these character s souls
