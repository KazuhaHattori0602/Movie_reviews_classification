i am easily pleased  i like bad films  i like films featuring attractive young women in small amounts of clothing   this film gives all the above a bad name  yes  you know going in that what you re getting is not high art  or anything like  but  even for the type of movie it is  beach babes from beyond isn t very good   some people have given it   i can only assume that these are people who have had the organs which enable rational thought to take place surgically removed   it isn t very good  it simply isn t very good     out of   solely on the grounds of a  novelty value for the famous relatives and burt ward and b  some of the girls are cute   oh  by the way  did i tell you that it isn t very good
