i think it s the first time that i go inside a theater and go out so disappointed  there were two reasons why i went to see  ast rix et les vikings  first as a film buff  and second as a big ast rix fan   in the end  the film doesn t satisfy any request  it s simply a big animated mess and it proves that the ast rix franchise is going from bad to worse   in fact  it has been this way since the death of first scenarist ren  goscinny in   his faithful collaborator  illustrator albert uderzo took his place  but the following books were clearly lacking of the quality that was present during the goscinny years    ast rix et les vikings  is based on the book  ast rix et les normands  which was published during the goscinny reign  the basic story is the same  goudurix  abraracourcix  nephew  arrives to the village and ast rix et ob lix must turn him into a real man  while the vikings come to gaul in order to discover what fear is  because it seems that fear gives wings   the similarities end here  what follows in the book is a non stop series of laughs  gags and hilarious dialog with the result that the vikings do discover fear and they flee gaul  the movie is silly  unfunny  fast paced  corny  well  just name a default and it has good chances of being applied   the difference between the book and the movie could be more acceptable if the movie was good  but the new ideas simply crashes it in a bottomless pit  even older ast rix movies such as  ast rix le gaulois  which almost transferred the lines one by one without changing them are easily better   animation has the quality of other  st century movies  but it has its faults and any film beginner could find the mistakes  the greatest example is the continuity mistake  where the day follows the night after a fraction of second  in the same sequence   imagine  they took animation studios from numerous countries and they still can t get adequate film making   the changes of the original story are simply unbearable  and they still could be even if there was no original story  goudurix  in the movie  has a pet pigeon named sms and who act as his cell phone   grossebaf  the viking chief  has a rebellious teen daughter named abba   and she constantly defies her father s authority  there s also a stupid viking wizard  his cartoonish dumb and muscular son  the faithful bride of grossebaf who is obsessed with decoration  her name is vikea  and  well i can t stand that much longer   we re far from the original gags from the original book  the biggest problem is the difficulty of transferring the images to the big screen  mainly because the greatest laughs in the books come from the verbal jokes and visual gags which do not have the same appeal on a theatre screen  i remember that the greatest moments in the book were ob lix laughing at the invaders  names  which all finish in  af  and goudurix tries to scare them in ridiculous ways   and if everything wasn t enough  somebody in the publicity staff decided to write on the movie poster that there s an already existing c line dion song which would be featured in the final credits  if it was a new song  i could have understood  but using an old song is only another proof that the movie is so badly made that they re ready to do anything in order to attract film goers   the only good point for this movie is that it is so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can t walk out of the theater without being left cold  in a summer release  it just can t hurt   the only other acceptable point of the movie is how goudurix becomes courageous  his psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not credible  while it s better pictured in the movie and the motivation point is more believable   so if you haven t seen the movie yet  don t waste your money on it  grab the book instead   oh ren  why did you leave us
