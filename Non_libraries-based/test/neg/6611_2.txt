when just days away before the film s premiere  its screenwriter backs out of the project  and demands his name to be removed from the credits  you know that this does not bode well    the books  on which  wiedzmin  is based on  have great potential for a vivacious fantasy film    geralt de rivia is a witcher  his sole purpose is to destroy the monsters that plague the world  but not everything monstrous looking is evil  and not everything fair is good
  but all that didn t matter  when a polish film crew  with a low budget  and no  or little appreciation for sapkowski s work  decided to make a  part mini series out of it  the two hour film is a by product of their actions  to maximize the profits    it s not hard to point out in this case  what makes people label this film as bad  plot  incoherent  thanks to cramming it with too many stories  acting  below average  with exception of zebrowski  dialogues  bland  editing  choppy  special effects  unbearable  and choreography  poor  add up to the film s overall bad experience  only the soundtrack  done by grzegorz ciechowski  brings out the beauty of the world of  wiedzmin  which was never brought to the screen  even poland s grandiose flora and fauna  where part of  the chronicles of narnia  the lion  the witch and the wardrobe  was shot  a crucial element in almost any fantasy film  were not used up to their full potential  the more i think about this dead loss  the more i m running out of words  at least  it s a comfort to know  that marek brodzki  the director of  wiedzmin  has directed only one film ever since  in addition  in germany    for now  we re left with top notch fantasy stories and a fantastic computer rpg  released in   referring to the wiedzmin books  but i m sure that one day  justice will be done for the wiedzmin saga  and we ll be treated with an equally good film adaptation soon enough
