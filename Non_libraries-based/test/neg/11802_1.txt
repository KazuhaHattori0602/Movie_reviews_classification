okay they tell you it s real  they don t list any screenwriters or directors  but one viewing of this movie will prove to anyone   it s not real in the way you were hoping for  the speaking rarely sounds like real natural talk but also down not sound to be scripted   possibly loosely scripted  to me it sounded much more like they were always trying to ad lib   which they almost always did poorly  therefore  they knew they were making a  movie  not just collecting real natural footage  so i m sure these people knew what was going on  knew they had certain spots to look for things that were set up and they were just told to ad lib around it all    major spoilers     okay  it s so lame  every item  spot or thing that could be strange or use d as a scare  is magically stumbled upon by these people  let me list off the ridiculously obviously faked things that happened that i remember     less than   minutes of entering the house  they turn a light switch on   the light sparks and a chandelier almost falls on a guy     they happen to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife  in it  while exploring the cellar     they hear a noise in an armoire  so they open the door slowly   bam   a cat happens to be in there and jumps straight at the camera while shrieking     then they happen to notice there is a hole in the wall  so let s stick our hand in wow  they pulled out a doll of a baby wrapped in mummy tape     let s go to the attic  uh oh it feels  heavy  up here boom   a chair flies across the room     time to eat  oh no   the girl that was scared of bugs had a roach in her sandwich   lol  ridiculous     let s get out the ouija board oops one of the legs on the planchette fell off the side of the board  that couldn t be because the people were pushing it could it    they find out a ghost there is named charles     wait   what was that noise in the chimney clink   oh my shackles fell out  i think she  kept people up here     now wimpy girl is going to brave looking up the chimney shaft oh  what s this she sees something and is asking people who aren t looking up the chimney what it is  swish   it falls off straight at her   perfect camera shot  she moves just in time  it was more chain     now we have to separate and each  cleanse  our designated rooms   wouldn t it be something if things started happening one by one to these people now okay   chick   wow  suddenly her room is shaking but no one elses does   dude   actually says to himself  charles  is that you charles it can t be you because you re just a figment of my imagination aren t you charles  well guess what  he gets knocked over and dragged across the floor  another lucky camera shot   chick   hears things try to communicate  and is standing there getting abrasions or something   dude   he was in the attic  reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter i don t remember what else     dude   runs  gets chick  they hear chick and dude   screaming they find them chained to a wall and strapped to a table  they leave  cut to black  final text tell us they escaped safely  were treated for minor cuts  they have since had nightmares and insomnia  we also find out the next day a   call was made by they name a someone named  charles    major spoilers   over   okay  when i first heard this movie was being made  i couldn t wait  i thought it was going to be real  real  real    and more professional  with more professional type people  i love the idea of this type of thing  i d love to see real haunting footage  before this movie was released i saw couple reviews of it by people online  they both claimed how fake it was and how stupid the people were  time passed i forgot about the film then i realized it was never released at theaters  so i found out it went straight to video  rented it found that every brutal review was completely true  it s too bad  i really wanted this to be good   random thought  the house didn t seem to have tvs  radios kitchen appliances that i recall which would make me think no one has lived there for a long time  especially the house is truly known for being haunted im pretty sure no one lives there  but it looks so clean and tidy and what was a cat doing there   the property does not have near by neighbors   all in all  you ll only want to rent this if you and your friends wanna sit there and make fun of it or if you heard about it a long time ago and it intrigued you   you will will be disappointed if you are expecting a good film or real film   random thought  i believe the producer says  the  footage  you see is real  well technically it is real footage isn t it   real footage of fake hauntings   maybe that was his loop hole   i give this this movie one star   strictly on the fact that they told the story of madame lalaurie  a real new orleans story   the best performance was by the guy who teaches the participants about the ghost hunting equipment in the beginning  he was obviously actually real or a good actor
