can i just start by saying i m a fan of bad movies  and this is a really bad movie  it states on the front   passengers    snakes  but i think it s more accurate to say   passengers and about   snakes   the snakes don t do anything particularly interesting  the whole movie in fact just blunders on with little happening  although there is occasionally a great gore shot of pulsating arms and green goo puke  bad movies have to have green goo don t they   but then the ending comes along and will quite literally smack you off you seat in hysteria  and for that  this movie gets a boost up to a   rating   there are certain movies about in the world that you will want to show to your friends  just so you can watch there reaction when a certain event happens in them   for example the arrival of  big man  in r kelly s  trapped in the closet   the line  in  shark attack    you ll know it when you hear it  the arrival of the mama shark in  shark attack   almost every scene of  troll   the ending of  dracula    just for utter disbelief and confusion  and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category  it s worth sitting through just for that  so get drunk  stoned  whatever your poison is and watch this movie with some mates   quite simply  if you like bad movies  get this  but don t get it confused with  snakes on a plane    there s no relation   and don t pay more than a fiver for it either
