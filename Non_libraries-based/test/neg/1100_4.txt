wicked little things  known in australia as  zombies  is a rare find   a film that promises one thing but delivers another  it is one of the few genre films to be made by millennium pictures  a european film studio known for making various b grade action films   thrillers  some featuring action star jean claude van damme   karen tunny   her two daughters sarah   emma arrive in the pennsylvanian town of addytown in order to move into a large house that karen s late husband owned after finding a miner s deed in his effects  once arriving  they find that the house is very old   in need of repair  but the house s condition is the least of their problems  as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances   karen is confronted by the area s owner   ordered to move out  once night falls  the tunnys find out the reason behind the vanishings  a group of zombie children  killed in a mine collapse in the area more than   years ago  come out to kill anything that goes in the woods  with the help of a grizzled neighbour  karen attempts to end the curse before her   her children become the next victims   i bought the dvd expecting a film with flesh eating zombies  but was let down by one thing  the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick  with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods  taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night  although the internal logic is somewhat flawed   the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals   are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic   mirrors   aren t these kids supposed to be zombies  the plot as such would not be a problem   would actually be entertaining  but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film  only to fall flat on their faces with this effort   as such  a film like this would be okay as a ghost story but  due to a poor script  becomes nothing more than an entirely routine effort  the film s greatest strength is the acting  with the cast giving better performances than the film deserves  of particular note is scout taylor compton  who does her role quite well   it s a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the halloween remake  or maybe it s just rob zombie s script
