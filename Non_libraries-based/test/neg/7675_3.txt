 oh  you pilots are such men   they don t call it the cockpit for nothing  honey  dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why the concorde
 airport    or  if you saw it in the uk where it dragged its heels getting released there  airport   the concorde  was the last and by far the least of the series  the disaster movie was in dire straits in the late s  what with the swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and beyond the poseidon adventure  when time ran out and city on fire simply offering much boredom  and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here  this time it s a conspiracy plot  with susan blakely s news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend robert wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the north vietnamese  naturally  she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public  but  he fobs her off by explaining  i m a very rich man  i have everything in life i could ever want  why would i jeopardise that by doing something so incredibly stupid  just in case she doesn t buy that line  rather than  say hire a hit man to kill her on the ground  he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the concorde while she s flying to moscow via paris   i ve done a lot of things i ve been ashamed of  but i am not a murderer  he insists indignantly on his way to reprogramme a guided missile to destroy the plane  so  nothing incredibly stupid there  and when that fails  he sends a jet fighter after it  and when that fails
   don t even think of looking for anything resembling logic here  this is real bottom of the barrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and marketed as a comedy in the us after critics laughed it off the screen  where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy big budget entertainments  this small screen friendly effort  the only one not to be shot in   widescreen  doesn t even manage to make the concorde look good  which is quite a feat  tv veteran david lowell rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast  cheap and had previously directed tv movie sst  disaster in the sky where peter graves  supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and senegalese flu  which was not  intentionally at least  a comedy despite the presence of a young billy crystal in the cast  and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a  m tv movie that somehow escaped into theatres when no one was looking   cast like a bad episode of hollywood squares  stars are in very short supply this time round  and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from rehab clinics and busted sitcoms  alain delon gives the hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot   happy fish   don t ask  george kennedy moves from the executive suite to the co pilot s seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies  while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of the towering inferno  wagner and blakely  a soft porn star  sylvia kristel  trying to go respectable  an ingmar bergman regular  bibi andersson   and she s the one playing the hooker  david warner s navigator on a diet having nightmares about being chased by bananas  the voice of the devil  mercedes mccambridge  charo and her seeing eye chihuahua  dohn miscon screw me  martha raye and her weak bladder  jimmie walker playing the sax in his seat and smoking weed in the john  in the few moments its not occupied by martha raye  cicely tyson kissing her credibility goodbye as the obligatory mother with critically ill child and a frozen heart in the overhead locker  airline owner eddie albert and trophy wife sybil danning occupying the best seat in the house  ed begley jr in goggles  and the russian olympic team and their lovable coach val avery and his deaf daughter  ahhhh  on a goodwill tour of the states  who knew about the boycott  just to add a touch of the simpsons to proceedings  harry shearer voices one news report in the same tones he d later use for smithers   highlight  despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing  it just has to be george kennedy diverting a heat seeking missile by opening the window  sticking his arm out  at nearly twice the speed of sound  and firing a flare   while the plane is upside down  and then alain delon turns off the engines so there won t be a  heat source  for the missiles to home in on
 yes  someone actually got paid for writing this  and that someone was future oscar winner and screenwriter of munich and the insider eric roth  hey  everybody has to start somewhere  although in his defence it was producer jennings lang who came up with the plot  still  what do you expect from a film that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of the concorde flying off into the sunset  amazingly  in one of those won t admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to  universal shot another   minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network tv showings  not included on the dvd  sadly its box office failure led to the fifth entry in the series  the laugh riot that would have been airport   ufo  never getting off the ground  even more genuinely tragically  it was the concorde used in this film that crashed in france   years later    oh  and if you re wondering what charo says to her chihuahua in unsubtitled spanish when it s not allowed on board  it s  what do you think  don t worry  when the revolution comes  i promise you will fly on anything you want  i promise  what a shame  my love  what do they think they are
