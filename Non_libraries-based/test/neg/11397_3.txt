they said it would be a film greater than turks fruit  how dare  they  it s not even   of this classic  bad acting  the only character i felt sympathy for was the one  played by angela schijf  her acting was the best in the whole film  the story could ve been interesting  but it wasn t  some scenes were very beautiful filmed  lights and camera   the  opening scene for example  but the bad acting made the magic  disappear   i really don t understand why so many people voted this film so  good
