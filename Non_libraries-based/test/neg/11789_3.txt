i really wanted to like this movie  great cast   walter pidgeon in a role that reminds us of his iconic  forbidden planet  barbara eden and robert sterling as young lovers  frankie avalon as a musically inclined sailor  is a guy on a submarine a sailor  even peter lorre as a scientist with a fondness for sharks  maybe it s a good kiddie movie but i had trouble staying awake  lorre was severely underused  i guess he was a red herring  like pidgeon   you expect him to maybe go nuts and try to throw the hero or his gal in the shark tank  no such luck  by the way  why is there a shark tank on a submarine  it s typical of the movie s lack of ambition  they explain why lorre is walking the shark back and forth  because we re seeing it  but just expect us to accept the fact that there s a shark on this sub for some reason   research  yeah  scientists are always doing that research stuff  who can understand them  of course  if there wasn t a shark  who would kill the evil psychologist lady  joan fontaine  i m sorry but even kid s movies in the  s are capable of being less predictable and frankly idiotic  not to mention exploitative   the first   or   minutes really got my hopes up  great theme song sung by frankie avalon  pidgeon leading floyd the barber  howard mcnear actually  sorry howie loved ya in  blue hawaii  and joan fontaine on a guided tour  careful to skip the room with the huge  warning  sign on the door  past peter lorre with aforementioned sharks  and then we see a full screen shot of eden shaking her moneymaker to avalon s impassioned horn playing  the movie quickly goes downstream from there  there s no real explanation for the firestorm threatening the earth  so there s a distinct lack of dramatic tension and no villain to boot  instead pidgeon s character is made into an unconvincing red herring vaguely of the ahab variety  i guess  the caine mutiny  was still fresh in people s minds  and fontaine s character suddenly turns evil for no reason at the end  oh  i suppose the reason is that it s a surprise for the audience  and it is kind of surprising  since the only negative thing she s done is to talk bad about the captain s mental health and there s still no reason why she did the sabotage after she s revealed to be the villain  very poorly done and unconvincing  the guy who was the pessimistic bible nut was better   at least his character made sense   so what else could go wrong  endless  interminable scuba diving footage  i never understand the appeal of that kind of thing  a giant squid attacks the ship for a minute  just so there s a monster for the theatrical trailer  maybe that fooled some people into thinking it was going to be a fantasy adventure film  instead of a half baked suspense movie about military scientists who are never wrong  yes   perhaps worst of all  it s barely a fantasy movie much less a science fiction movie  it never did anything for my imagination because the whole premise was nothing but another disaster apocalypse and these characters never experience any feelings of wonder or discovery  i m through with irwin allen  i never liked his later movies anyway  but this one got me by pretending to be jules verne when it s really just another formula exercise in disaster escapism  the whole movie is just waiting to see which character will improbably turn evil and die  he always hired an actor actress with a charming and personable screen persona to play these roles and that s the only element of  surprise  to be found since there s no logic to these characters anyway  what a pathetic waste of time for these actors  george pal s movies are   times better  the only one that was lame was  atlantis  which  not coincidentally  was the most allen esquire  full of wonder and excitement and   think of it    ideas  other than a few effects scenes and barbara eden  there s nothing worth seeing here in my opinion  i guess it s good fun for those who are into disaster movies  but i think they are a hollow and dull genre of films
