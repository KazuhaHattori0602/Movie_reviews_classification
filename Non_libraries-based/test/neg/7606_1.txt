i made the mistake of watching  dark star    late one night many years ago  it was one of the stupidest movies that i have ever watched     bad acting     bad writing     scientifically stupid plot   destroying an entire planet because its orbit is unstable or in the way will only make matters worse  instead of having one large  easily avoidable object  you ll have thousands of smaller  but equally lethal and more difficult objects to track     completely unrealistic characters  a painted beach ball as a space alien  the writers must have been doing too many drugs   not surprisingly  the majority of actors that starred in  dark star  never did anything else  of those that did do anything else  the majority never acted again after dark star  therefore  having dark star on one s acting resume was a death star to one s acting career
