the cavern    out of   blair witch meets the cave and gives me a headache   i have something to ask all film schools  could you please teach future directors how to hold a camera steady  flailing the camera around like aunt betty with   drinks is headache inducing   also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to point their camera s in the general direction of the action  film also requires light to work  perhaps a light source should be employed so one can see the action on the screen  i know it is a cave movie but there is absolutely nothing frightening about watching pitch blackness for minutes at a time   for that matter showing the film upside down doesn t indicate confusion on screen it indicates confusion in the editing booth   a last note to the director i m sure there was a good reason to have a horribly fake cgi campfire  i honestly can t for the life of me think of one   now on to the screenwriter  try to make at least one character likable  i d prefer two or more but one decent person i can root for or care about might help  also if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story   if you are going to have a surprise ending it is probably best if it doesn t contradict every single thing that comes before it  and try adding some fancy spelunking terms to a cave movie  you might have wanted to start with spelunking   the cavern is a pretty bad film  poorly shot with a confusing  improbable and anticlimactic ending
