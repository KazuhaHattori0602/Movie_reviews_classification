i m rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving   the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent  if provocative  idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship  but one  if i can judge by the real life examples i ve known  is extremely deep and loving   however  the film is cheaply scripted poorly scripted and although it has a number of very pretty looking shots  i didn t find it to be anything special   probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly composed to give its audience time enough to invest  emotionally  in the characters  we don t really care about any of them  and so their stresses and obstacles don t really touch us   i think a remake from the screenplay up with some character development by some really good writers could improve it greatly  it is instructive to compare this film with brokeback mountain  which the screen writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay screen writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy  and carried out their task with care  planning  and superb craftsmanship  however  people only seem to remake those films that don t need it  you re not really missing anything if you skip this one  i found it very disappointing indeed  and it is only saved from getting a  star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject
