i probably have to blame myself
but i sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title  black dragons  and revolves on secret wwii conspiracies  nazi plastic surgeons and revenge  this film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure  the actual plot  which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing  only becomes clear during an explication near the end  but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before  we see how horror icon bela lugosi infiltrates in a society of prominent american politicians and kills them one by one  the story is timed right before wwii and   especially after witnessing the ending   it surely is a premise with lots of potential  so it s quite a shame it isn t elaborated more proper  there is however one great dialogue that i can t resist sharing  man towards woman   do you want to marry me   why   so i can beat you up
it s the only way you ll leave this place  it s the only highlight in an overall very boring movie  bela lugosi is lovely   as usual   but his spooky performance alone is hardly worth purchasing this film  if you re interested in seeing other ghoulish performances of his  in movies with decent screenplays  check out  invisible ghost   the corpse vanishes   white zombie  and of course the   dracula version
