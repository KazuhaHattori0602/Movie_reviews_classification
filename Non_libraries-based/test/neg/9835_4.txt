the girl in lovers lane is one strange little low budget film  on its surface  the movie tells the story of a tough drifter named bix  brett halsey  who spends his time looking out for a young kid named danny  lowell brown  and the girl  carrie  joyce meadows  that bix meets who would like to look out for him  nothing overly interesting happens  bix goes out with carrie  bix gets danny out of trouble  carrie s father drinks a lot  etc  until about   minutes to go in the movie when carrie is murdered  her father blames bix  pulls him out of a jail cell  and just about beats him to death  now their roles are reversed and danny has to save bix   until i read the reviews on imdb  i thought that maybe it was just me reading more into bix and danny s relationship than was really there  but i see now that i m not alone  it was quite obvious to me early on that bix and danny had more of a relationship than you usually see in a movie from   the homosexual nature of their relationship  while never openly expressed  is still quite obvious  their living and sleeping arrangements  bix s reaction to finding danny in bed with a prostitute  bix s inability to commit to carrie  and that phone call at the end when danny tells his parents he s  brining home a friend are a few examples of moments that lead to the inevitable conclusion that there s more to their relationship than initially meets the eye  i m sure they exist  but i can t think of any movies i ve seen from the  s that scream homosexual quite as loudly as this one   as for the movie  i don t know any other way to put this   it s boring  as i wrote earlier  nothing much at all happens for   of the run time  the characters are dull and the actors aren t good enough to give the girl in lovers lane much of a spark  the lone exception is jack elam  his crazy jesse is the one character interesting enough to be worth watching  elam had creepy down pat  but i guess the biggest problem i had with the movie was with character motivation and logic  carrie is killed and bix is immediately blamed  what about crazy jesse who has been stalking carrie for probably her whole life  anyone think to ask jesse where he was that night  her father has seen him bother carrie at the diner  yet he never considers that the leering jesse might have something to do with his daughter s death  not a lot of logic there  and what about jesse s confession  danny grabs jesse by the lapel and this is all it takes to force a confession out of jesse  real tough guy  huh  why would he confess so easily  and after he confesses  no one thinks to grab him  it s awfully nice of jesse just to stay put and not run off  in any other reality  he would have never spilled his guts and would have run like a rabbit if he had been fingered for the murder  the fact that the girl in lovers lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions on the part of the characters is something i m not willing to do  overall  i m giving the girl in lovers lane a
