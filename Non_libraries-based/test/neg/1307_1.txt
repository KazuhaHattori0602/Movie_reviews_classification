i usually like these dumb no brain activity movies  but this was just too stupid  there were way too many clich s and the plot didn t really make much sense  there were a lot of loose ends and the ending was extremely poor and abrupt  we didn t even get too see if the big master plan worked  we only got too see the main character sob over his dead farther  the professor  that died because of stupidity  see below   one scene annoyed me particularly  why did the professor only have about   minutes of oxygen in his container when he went to manually override the dam  and if they only had oxygen containers containing   minutes worth of oxygen  why didn t he bring two or three of them  then he would have survived
 that was bloody stupid  the movie is pretty full of such stupid things  i can not recommend it at all
