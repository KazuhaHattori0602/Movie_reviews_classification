possible minor spoiler  it s not a terribly objective review but i just found this movie horribly depressing  like a lot of russell t  davies   work  it asks more questions than it can answer  his best work  bob   rose  doctor who  revels in hope against the odds and perseverance even after apparent defeat  these uplifting themes seemed strangely absent here  i suppose the fact that i m still thinking about it days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program but the resolution was just too bleak for my tastes    i would  however  disagree with the reviews i ve read complaining that the end feels  tacked on  i think each conclusion follows logically from its premise and the ending represented a sound personal belief that neatly resolved the primary theme of the show  while i never really questioned the progression of events  i felt like there was much that could have been expanded upon  i ve also read that it was originally conceived as a four part series instead of two  and it s possible that the truncation has done some harm to the completed piece  however  these flaws appear throughout  in sequences and themes that sometimes feel rough or sketched in   to his credit davies is totally unafraid to write big  and you have to admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project  the premise he tackles here is the stuff of movies or novels   it is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it in the medium of television  strong points include christopher eccleston  who is positively mesmeric in the lead  for me  he was and remains the best reason to watch  the depiction of the messiah s humanity was brilliant  thought provoking and engaging and a real credit to both davies  writing and eccleston s acting  i also thought the depiction of the modern world s reaction to the second coming rang true    so  two stars simply because i personally want my entertainment to be entertaining  i would rather be uplifted or  at least  distracted by my fiction  i have a whole big real world around me   as filtered through cnn or the newspapers   if i choose to be horribly depressed  there are definitely less subjective reasons by which to judge this piece but i m afraid my judgment in this matter is clouded by my emotional response
