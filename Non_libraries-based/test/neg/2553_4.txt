i must say i was disappointed with this film  although it is well acted and directed  the underlying story simply plods along too slowly   granted  in another mood i would have liked it better  i did chuckle a lot  but rarely laughed out loud  and there was actually a sense of suspense to discover who won  but in contrast to another movie that my wife picked up the same day  one neither of us had heard of before  this one paled in comparison   if you see lots of movies  then by all means see this   it s distinctly better than your average fare  but if you  like me  have limited time and want to watch only the best and most entertaining  save this for later   [rate   ]
