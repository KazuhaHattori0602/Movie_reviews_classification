i ll start by confessing that i tend to really enjoy action movies  military or other  i m a guy  but this dreck was awful  i saw it for free  showtime or hbo and still feel i paid too much  it was a prolonged episode of general hospital    i gave it a   only because   or   was not possible  how or why   others would give it a rating of between   and   boggles my mind  unless they are all family of the cast or crew    it might be  this movie was so bad many bailed out and as such  were too uninvested to bother   i m sorry for repeating but the   line minimum seems silly  for what essentially boils down to a warning in hopes of saving others the   hr black hole  this movie represents  trust me  stare at a blank wall  they ll be more action
