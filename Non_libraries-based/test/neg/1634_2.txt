another in the long line of conan wannabes that tired to cash in on that movie s success  this italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came  you know it s a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasn t money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people  i won t even bother going into the plot as i defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline  maybe it s the television cut i watched  but i can t imagine any version being that much better  it all seems so random to me  evil sorcerers  cavemen  giant snakes  medieval castles  grenades  and hang gliding   none of it fits together  it s as if director joe d amato had an epileptic fit while making cave dwellers  or any of the other half dozen names the movie goes by  and threw everything he could think of onto the screen regardless of how unrelated it was or how it fit into the film s already puzzling plot  the acting is sufficiently bad  miles o keeffe could never act his way out of a wet paper bag and he proves that once again in this movie  the rest of the cast is equally atrocious  then there s the       well  you get the idea  it s late  i m tired  and i ve already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage  take my word for it   avoid cave dwellers  or whatever you want to call it  at all costs
