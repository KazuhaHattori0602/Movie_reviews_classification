this is a fine concept piece and the acting by brando is a fine piece of work  dean martin isn t bad and montgomery clift is quite good as well  unfortunately  it s a very disjointed  very long piece that really should have been edited down to something closer to   hours  it s almost   hours    we follow the lives of   men from   through the end of wwii and watch as they discover who they are and what they might become as they discover both the world about them and what they re made of  for some  it s the women in their lives that brings about this realization  for others  it s the broader general circumstances  all too often however  i found myself asking what had just happened or what the import of a particular scene was
