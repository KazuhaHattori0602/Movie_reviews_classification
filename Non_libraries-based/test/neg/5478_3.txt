sure  the concept had already been done with alf and the charmings  thrust modern society onto one or more out of place characters  but i loved both shows and watched them religiously until they ended in   when i learned about scorch  i was actually very hopeful for something new  as new tv in the  s so far hadn t impressed me  but at least star trek  tng and the simpsons were still going   what i got was a big disappointment  the acting was awful  but considering the ridiculous dialogue and wholly unbelievable writing  i can t blame them too much for what they had to work with  there were a few humorous moments  but most of the deliberate jokes seemed forced in their delivery  the whole production work on the show seemed too low budget for what was on tv at the time  in the  s it would have fit right in   still  it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and establish the entire premise of the series  so i gave it the benefit of the doubt  the second episode wasn t as bad  and i started to get my hopes back that once it got into its stride  the show would improve  sadly  my vcr ended up not recording the third episode aired  i never got to see it  and the series disappeared from the tv listings after that  all i have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air onto a vhs tape
