oh boy  oh boy  on the cover of worn out vhs has a picture of sandra bullock and her name written on top  i think only reason they had chance to sell the movie in nineties  was because of sandra bullock s name  bullock s fans don t have to disappoint  sandra is only thing to watch in this movie and her performance is the only you can call acting  rest of the movie
 it s fun to watch in first fifteen minutes because it s bad but after that it s going worse  much worse  directing is awful  acting is awful  script is awful  dialog is awful  action is awful  music is quite good actually  typical score for eighties action movies  this movie is so bad that it goes close to anything andy sidaris has ever produced  it s so bad that there isn t proper word to describe this poor attempt to be a movie  but still  there was sandra bullock  and super cool  sarcasm  jake lamotta who tried to be marlon brando    i think they can now bring the film out on dvd  it could be cool  and they should write on the cover  academy award winner sandra bullock in hangmen    out of
