i think it s two years ago since i have seen the movie and till this day it s the worst film i have ever seen  the only thing i thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason  so after all this time i finally spilled my gut   and now imdb says i have to fill   lines with comments    sorry  you must provide at least   lines in your comment  please return to the edit window  or use the back option if this isn t a new window   please there is nothing to say anymore   sorry for some bad english
