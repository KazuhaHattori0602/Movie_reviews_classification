i saw this film shortly after watching moonlight   valentino with elizabeth perkins  gwyneth platrow  whoopi goldberg and kathleen turner  there are a lot of similarities between the two films  they both have great casts and good acting  they both have stock characters of sisters who are very different  an offensive stepmother  a woman friend confidant  an emotionally unavailable father  a dead mother and a surprise lover  both films have the characters experience life changing realizations and both films suffer from a kind of  love conquers all  sentimentality  they both add a little titillation with cameron diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of gwyneth paltrow naked   both films seem contrived  as if the writers of the works the films are based on did market research and said   ok  there s a market for stories about relationships between women  so i m going to write about two sisters with an offensive stepmother
  in other words  instead of the drama emerging from the truth of the relationship  the relationship is invented to fit the dramatic situation  it seems forced  the characters don t seem real  the relationships are unbelievable   the resolution of the tensions between the characters is simplistic with simple apologies completely whisking away years of acrimony leaving everyone feeling warm and fuzzy ever after  it s just not real  romantic fantasy   the characters in in her shoes are a little more overblown than moonlight   valentino  especially the stepmother part  sydelle feller is so evil that it is difficult to believe that the father would stay with her  or even marry her in the first place   if you liked moonlight   valentino you will probably like in her shoes as well  enjoyable performances in both  in fact  the actors bring depth to their parts that goes way beyond the contrived sentimentality of the scripts
