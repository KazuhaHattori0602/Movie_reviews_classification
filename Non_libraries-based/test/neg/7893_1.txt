i ll be honest  the pimped out purple plane with snoop dogg at the helm is an amusing visual gag  it would have been a decent concept for a   second commercial  or maybe a   minute music video  but the producers have committed the age old concept comedy sin of stretching   seconds of material into an hour and a half of film  and the results are predictably lame  the remainder of the   minutes are filled with the typical gamut of racist and sexist humor and fart jokes  offensive and  worst of all  painfully unfunny  the threadbare plot screams under the weight of its contrivances  best to be avoided unless you are drunk or stoned
