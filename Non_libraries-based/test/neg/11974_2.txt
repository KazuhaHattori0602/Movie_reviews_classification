  with a   budget and a bottle of ketchup   if you are a fan of c movies with no talented actors whatsoever  a ridiculous story  cheap effects and lousy camera work  this film delivers   all others be warned  you could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder   the film is good for some laughs though  watch it with some friends and discuss how not to make a movie     for unintentional comedy   why the hell do you have to write   lines  i have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler
