very disappointing  th chapter of this slowly dying series  very evident that the budget was extremely low  this movie was made for one reason and one reason alone  to sell puppet master toys  fans  such as myself of the series have decided  from what i have read and heard that the only one in the series worse than this is curse of the puppetmaster  in turn  turning us away from the series    opting to make this a pg  film  for whatever reason  did not work in the films favor  the plot seemed almost to be there  but was easily lost in the steady stream of nonsense    the only film in the series worth watching  also directed by decoteau is part     toulon s revenge   granted  i do favor the scenery in the film    yuck
