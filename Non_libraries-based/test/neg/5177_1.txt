blame guy ritchie  the late  s success of ritchie s clich ridden lock stock and two smoking barrels triggered a series of pitiful gangster movies from which the genre never really recovered  sadly rise of the footsoldier   the true story of essex hardnut carlton leach   isn t likely to reverse that trend  despite a decent lead performance from hartnett  the film falls victim to all too familiar east end stereotypes  they re either busy blowing someone s brains out or shagging a scantily clad blonde   from fearsome football hooligan in the eighties to a key figure in the criminal underworld during the nineties  footsoldier charts leach s rise through the ranks of thuggery  leaving the terraces for nightclubs  leach becomes a bouncer where he s given carte blanche to kick the crap out of anyone  here he gets in with notorious gangland leaders pat tate  fairbrass  and tony tucker  stone  and begins to realise gang warfare ain t what it s cracked up to be   there is fun to be had deconstructing writer director julian gilbey s laughable join the dots yob patois  as every sentence seems to start with an   i m gonna fackin 
  or  you fackin 
  or  on occasion   so then i only went an  fackin 
  typically concluded with a mandatory  caaaant  the direction  too  smacks of sadism  especially the obvious glee gilbey gets from filming violent scenes in close up and  in the case of the bloody shotgun to the face denouement  in triplicate   director gilbey s use of the classic rise and fall gangster narrative isn t what will condemn footsoldier to big screen obscurity  nor is it the fact that half way through  the film annoyingly sidelines leach in favour of the events culminating in the infamous shooting of tate and tucker  it s gilbey s sickening appetite for scatter shot violence that ruins the film  whether it s a brick in the face or axe in the head during a vicious attack on a train  it s all unnecessarily prolonged  footsoldier doesn t so much pack a punch as leave you feeling violated and more importantly  robs you of two hours of your life you won t get back
