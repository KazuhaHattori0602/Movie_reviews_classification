this takes place on fire island back in the  s  a couple peter  craig dudley  and buddy  j  will deane  are throwing a  th of july party at their house  unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests  the rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between peter and buddy   ok i m a gay man but i was   back when this was made  if this is a true view of what gay life was in the  s  i m glad i wasn t around  from the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand   this movie slides slowly into disaster  there s a guru  robert case  who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance  i wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first long speech  there s the young kid danny who is there for his first time  there s the lesbian couple  who do nothing except one strips for no reason  there s the leather queen  worst of all is the effeminate man named jimmy  jimmy foster  we re introduced to him and his friend  whose name i never got  when they get a flat tire  they basically scream and screech for   minutes and have no idea how to fix a flat  i know some people find this funny but i found it offensive and pretty sad  the party itself is full of people you would never want to know  it s like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people  with the sole exception of dudley no one can act   this may be valuable as a portrait of what fire island was like in the  s but it s pretty dull viewing  this gets a   only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies
