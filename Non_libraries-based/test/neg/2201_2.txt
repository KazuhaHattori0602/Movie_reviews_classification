spoiler alert   i don t go into  high tech  movies expecting them to be   accurate on all things computer related  but somehow  even the average  i have a computer  user is supposed to believe that     a computer professional with a top secret  special data    is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a   floppy    and make absolutely no backup of this special secret data  even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake   also this is the worst represntation of a computer nerd ever  even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends  neighbors  extended family  or coworkers who can identify her  even the unabomber had a family that could turn him in   end spoiler  these aren t just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie   these are the major plot points that fueled the storyline  the characterization was awful  the plot wholly unbeleivable  and if you haven t seen this  don t bother
