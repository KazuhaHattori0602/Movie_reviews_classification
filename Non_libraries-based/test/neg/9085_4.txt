during an eight year stretch of the  s when charles bronson made nine films  only one was released by a company other than the cannon group   the evil that men do  a tristar films pickup from sir lew grade s itc entertainment firm  bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director j  lee thompson  which ran through numerous actioners until  kinjite  forbidden subjects  in    expectations should run pretty high with bronson and thompson working for a better funded outfit like itc  but  the evil that man do  is a great disappointment on many levels  while still from the low budget  b movie mold of the  s   evil  has tantalizing potential for a great film  everyone in the production department  however  took an easy way out and sold hack work undeserving of bronson s imprint   the evil that men do  had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of bronson and thompson s best films  but instead will go down as one of their most average   this   political thriller actioner opens in brutal fashion with clement molloch  joseph maher  a british doctor  holding his special training class for political leaders in surinam  the gray haired  passive molloch is an expert on torture methods who is employed by numerous political regimes  in the opening seven minutes  we witness molloch using electrical current to inflict unbearable pain on jorge hidalgo  jorge humberto robles  a dissident journalist  as you may expect  the scene is awful to watch and was cut from the original vhs release   hidalgo was none other than a friend of holland  bronson  a retired assassin who is enjoying life in the cayman islands  holland was approached by the journalist years before to rid humanity of molloch  but turned the offer down  a mexican professor named hector lomelin  jos  ferrer  visits shortly after hidalgo s death to talk holland into finishing the job  bringing videotapes of testimony from the doctor s victims  while in denial at first  holland eventually agrees to the dirty work  targeting molloch and his doting sister claire  antoinette bower  in guatemala   holland enters guatemala city with help from an adviser  max ortiz  ren  enr quez  he poses as a tourist with hidalgo s widow rhiana  theresa saldana  and young daughter sarah  amanda nicole thomas  in tow  as with most of bronson s later output  his character knocks off molloch s henchmen one by one  crossing paths with a sleazy american diplomat  john glover  and his supporting hit man  roger cudney  along the way  a brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal mine  where the doctor gets just deserts from several of his victims    the evil that men do  is based on a forgotten novel by r  lance hill and jumps at american political dealings in latin america during the  s  indeed   evil  is hard boiled in every sense of the term  as it uses sensationalism and doses of brutality to cover up huge weaknesses in plot and character development  for every plus this film has  there are three or four minuses  resulting from shod craftsmanship   while  the evil that men do  has a great concept  the film is never truly more than an excuse for bronson to wipe out foreign based scum  in the style of bad pulp fiction   evil  is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand  holland  despite being played strongly by bronson  never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him into becoming a killer for hire  rhiana  a terribly weak part for theresa saldana  is disgusted by holland for much of the way but later feels an affection for him  where does her love come from  especially after watching holland kill several people and wanting to go home just a few scenes before   the most interesting characters are actually molloch and his sister claire  because so many questions can be asked of them  naturally  we never find out what has brought them so close together  how and where their torture dealings started  what claire s exact role in their business is
these plot holes can go on forever  especially with the paint by numbers storyline that seems to make things up as it goes along  why is hidalgo s daughter brought into such a dangerous situation  other than for her to be conveniently taken hostage by molloch  if molloch s bodyguard randolph  raymond st  jacques  clearly saw holland and rhiana in the cockfight arena  why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords  is his memory that short  and what really was the purpose  other than cheap theatrics  of holland throwing molloch s chauffeur cillero  jorge luke  off a window ledge when the murder could have been handled more discreetly in claire s apartment   the overall acting is decent and somehow bronson gives one of his strongest performances  j  lee thompson s direction is lacking at points  but may have been compromised by limited time on site  besides evil s filming in mexico  the presence of itc is clear through better production values  cinematography  and music  rural locations are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of latin america and cinematographer xavier cruz provides rich color and clarity  the orchestral score by ken thorne  murphy s war  is refreshing in an era of synthesized junk  oddly enough  these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that is screaming to come out  peter lee thompson s editing is better than usual  although with more laughable continuity errors    the evil than men do  was perfect grindhouse material for the early  s and i find it hard to recommend for  st century action fans  the dvd from columbia tristar entertainment is an okay presentation  offering widescreen and standard format with four language subtitles  while the video quality is well above average   evil  was originally recorded in plain mono audio  the theatrical trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel  with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality     out of
