some years back  this film had been scheduled for broadcast on tcm uk as part of a tod browning retrospective   but what they actually showed was the   remake  my brother had watched it  and  in hindsight  it followed the original pretty much scene for scene  even down to the set design    though no classic  he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version
   this being the first collaboration between browning and bela lugosi  i had high hopes for it   but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the film s main concern was to appease the still novel sound technique  and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static  the thriller plot isn t exactly exciting either  even less appetizing is the ostensible british indian setting  with the characters  affected accents and upper class demeanor   not to mention the over use of corny idiosyncratic idioms such as  i say   rather  and  now look here    rendering the whole risible more than anything else    apart from this  there are a few unintended howlers  margaret wycherly  as a fake medium  pleads with police inspector lugosi  if anything  his undeniable screen presence is already evident  to give her some time to  work out  who the culprit of the double murder really is  the evidence points to her own daughter  played by leila hyams    she hears a tapping and is deluded into thinking that the spirit world has genuinely made contact with her
but then lugosi enters the room and  in his unmistakable accent  straight facedly tells her  i knocked twice   you didn t hear me  at which my brother and i almost fell to the floor in convulsions of laughter  the editing is really sloppy  too  during one high angle shot of the main set  a mike is seen being rapidly pulled up out of camera range   and even worse are a couple of instances where a person walks off screen  ostensibly into the next shot  to another part of the set
but each shot is held on the other actors for an absurdly long time  so that it appears to take forever for this person to walk just a few paces    the thirteenth chair marks the third non horror browning talkie that i ve watched   even if both this and miracles for sale   deal with murder and occultism and could  therefore  still be linked to the genre  much has been said about the director s apparent slackening with the coming of sound  however  flawed though they may be  the   straight horror films he did throughout the  s are infinitely better than the rest   which i ve always found stylish and bizarre enough to suggest that browning wasn t as much at sea during this period as has been suggested
