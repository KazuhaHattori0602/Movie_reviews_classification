i went into this movie hoping for an imaginative twist on the second coming  boy  was i ever wrong  bbc are dullards at pacing a movie  total idiots at creating suspense  fools at building intensity  and this movie is no exception to the rule of how much bbc sucks   ugh  the pacing and time wasting laborious dialogue was just painful to sit through  the first   minutes felt like   hours  i kept looking down at my watch wondering when the pointless  monotonous drivel would end  they wasted a perfectly good actor in the lead role  because the material is so lazy  and sloppily  written  everything that happens is just to kill time   out of   minutes  only   minutes are interesting  the controversial ending  what a shame  reading the plot summary is more interesting than watching the movie  the preaching  the  am i god  endless blah blah blah ing  the dumb as doornails boring miracles  ugh   do not watch this crap
