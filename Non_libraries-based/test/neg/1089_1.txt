we have given this film one star for awful  however  it really depends on how you look at it  we are currently watching this on channel   at  am  and we haven t stopped laughing  so perhaps we could give it a   just for the entertainment value  right from the outset  with the  manic  thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion  we were laughing  is it me or does that chick from knott s landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystal   i m not going to spoil it for you  however  you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming  i don t think its clever enough for double bluffs   this has to be the worst best film we have ever seen  if we d been playing the  spot the clich  drinking game  then we be wasted by now
