 spoilers within  what a dull  predictable  non scary snore fest  the movie had no character development  i felt no empathy towards any of the characters  except may be the small boy  and did not care what happened to any of them  the movie had so many clich d bits  or elements stolen from other horror movies   the movie was so predictable  many times i would be saying to myself   let me guess   fill in guess  happens next  yup  i was right  even in the opening scene  i predicted that the  attack  on the family was by some man  probably the father  because only the wife and children were attacked  sure enough  that is what happened  of course  you have to wait   minutes to find out for sure  and  of course  another  evil man  scenario  why was he evil and killing his family  because he s a man  duh   as someone else stated  this movie may be scary for someone under   years of age  or for a movie from the  s  but it is far from being a  scary  movie by todays standards  and  like so many other crap horror movies  a lot of the scares were  fakes  scary music  scary music  scary music  and a crow suddenly flies at the window  wow  scary   how did the old bank guy manage  a few times  to walk across an open lot without the father seeing him  i thought  for sure  that the old man was a ghost  nope  just a crappy movie   i rated this movie a   out of   because it did keep my attention enough to sit through the whole thing
