a colleague from work told me to watch this movie  since he considered this movie to be one of the best movies ever  so i did watch it  first i have to admit that i dislike mainstream movies and prefer to watch movies with a real meaning   and this is the point  why i dislike this movie  it doesn t have any meaning  it s just a combination of funny  stupid  boring  entertaining  absurd and thrilling pieces   at first i thought that this movie could be a real mystery thriller  as the german packaging read  but the movie was too mysterious for me   david lynch may be able to make a combination of the most different images  but the composition tastes to me as awfull as a combination of milk with beer  both for themselves are pretty good  but together
