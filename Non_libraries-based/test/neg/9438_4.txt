i know this film was shown on local tv when i was a kid  but i can t remember whether i watched it or not  seeing it now  considering how utterly forgettable it is  i still don t know   so i counted it as a first viewing  there have been several films featuring the title character  a creation of visionary french author jules verne  these include    leagues under the sea   with james mason in the role  master of the world   vincent price  mysterious island   herbert lom  captain nemo and the underwater city   robert ryan  and the mysterious island of captain nemo   omar sharif   this version stars academy award winner jose  ferrer  however  even if the premise itself isn t half bad   awakened from suspended animation in his submarine   the nautilus  and finding himself in modern times  nemo adopts all his ingenuity to aid the u s  navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist burgess meredith   it emerges as easily his most infantile adventure yet  for instance  five seconds into the film  meredith s assistant   donning a steel mask   rants that  the world shall be ours  equally hilarious are the zealous gesticulations of the similarly decked out midget  whose task it is to fire the professor s all important  delta beam    and how about those android type minions aboard meredith s vessel who never seem to do much of anything    ferrer manages to maintain his dignity throughout  but meredith is an embarrassment  in what is virtually a retread of his penguin characterization from the  s batman tv series and film  where the budget was so tight   mostly invested in bland production design and shoddy special effects  no doubt  and both evidently influenced by star wars     that  apparently  they couldn t even afford him a decent costume  he looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in a sub  the supporting cast includes mel ferrer  playing a saboteur in the vein of joan fontaine from another irwin allen production  voyage to the bottom of the sea [ ]  and who engages in a swashbuckling routine with his namesake inside the engine room of  the nautilus  lynda day george  unsurprisingly  she s the only female character around  and horst buchholz  as the king of atlantis   for whatever reason  nemo is obsessed with locating the famed lost continent   by the way  having been reduced from a three part mini series for theatrical exhibition  the film obviously feels choppy   though one is still able to discern where one episode ended and another began
