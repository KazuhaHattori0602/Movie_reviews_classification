i have never seen this movie on its own  but like many others who have already commented  i saw it as an episode of mst k  really terrible  s television schlock  but someone saw its potential because it s just been turned into a   million flop called the island   and to the person who asked whether there were any good movies made in the  s  i want to remind her that it was a golden age for american film with directors like robert altman and martin scorcese first coming into their own  not to mention little things like star wars   just a reminder that the  s were far more creative than the  st century has been so far
