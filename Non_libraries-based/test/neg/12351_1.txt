i saw this in a preview screening and have to say that this documentary style movie is the biggest load of tripe i have ever seen   completely unfunny  low budget  boring  rubbish script  terrible acting   the entire audience  young and old  sat through the film comatose without laughing for most of it  there were literally only about   places you will laugh in the entire movie  many people left halfway   can t blame them  i stayed thinking that the film would pick up  however  it never did and i wish i d left    the humour was really lame and i am surprised that this ever made it on to the big screen  i am not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all   it just wasn t funny  the people who made this movie really don t deserve your money  so please don t pay to see this film   this isn t even funny enough to be shown on tv  let alone cinema   i wanted to give it   out of   but the system won t allow it
