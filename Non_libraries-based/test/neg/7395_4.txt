imagine a gilligan s island set in the african desert in modern times  add people nowhere near as jaunty as the skipper or marianne and enough angst to fill a german psychiatrist s office  throw in a plot that manages to be interesting only episodically and literary parallelism that never delves deeply enough to truly satisfy  season with a truly morose topic that s been exploited since the first world travelers found themselves very  very lost   if the king is alive weren t a product of the reigning czars du jour of dogme   would this film be garnering as much attention  dogme   is to hollywood as danish modern is to rococo  a byproduct of digital technology  this scandinavian movement seeks quite dogmatically to strip away artificiality in film making  by using more natural elements and returning to the essence of storytelling  pearl harbor  for instance  is the dogme antichrist   director co author kristian levring s saga ponders interpersonal relations and human nature when placed under the fire of a life threatening situation  eleven people aboard a bus riding through the namibian sand dunes suddenly find themselves stranded in the remains of an abandoned town  an african local who does not speak their language serves as observer and narrator  whose insights are among the film s most trenchant  as the strongest heads off for a five day walk to the nearest village  the others stay behind  surviving on dented canned carrots and circumambulating their likely future as vulture chow  former thespian henry decides that this rather unappealing crew needs a diversion  and hand writes king lear from memory  he assigns roles  and the group passes many days learning lines and rehearsing  in an effort to divert their attention from the seemingly inevitable   gradually the cast begins to lose it  and the savageries of their nature or  william golding might say  human nature begin to surface  if you ve ever seen lord of the flies  you know that these things can get ugly  that being in a lifeboat situation can turn even mother teresa into the pmsing termagant of calcutta   the film was shot using an international ensemble of american  english  french and south african actors  who  the dogme dogma dictates  develop themselves and their roles quite organically  the king was also filmed chronologically  adding a sense of realism to the ever increasing desperation of its characters  after up to three hand held cameras shot in digital  results were transferred to  mm film   the performance that compels most comes from jennifer jason leigh  who plays a boho pop tart trying to bolster the spirits of the group in any and every way she can  henry  david bradley  is another finely played character  whose passion for his life s work ultimately saves the gang from utter despair  it s hard to feel too sorry for the others cruel wives and their oafish husbands  hirsute old womanizers  sulky french intellectuals  wealthy men who have more important places to be than marooned in the namibian desert  beckett might hate this question  but why is this group riding a bus together through remote africa in the first place  life threatening morbidity  utter despair rendered in graphic detail  a relentlessly tedious pace  enjoy
