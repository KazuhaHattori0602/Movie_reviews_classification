this is not a good film   i can usually sit through a van damme movie if i have to  as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don t require much thought  this one has no redeeming features    it has a distinct lack of plot  humour  acting  direction etc etc  a real stinker on all levels    i have never walked out of a cinema during a movie  although i came damme close here    avoid at all costs
