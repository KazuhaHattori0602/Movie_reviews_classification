like a lot of the comments above me  also i though this was the average scifi movie  but unfortunately it was not  i found it rather patronizing  and indeed  preaching   but that is not the only comment  the scenes are very  artificial   not as in scifi  as i will explain a in a few moments   the next sentence is a small spoiler  the movie more or less represents a discussion between two groups  the physical setting of a discussion typically involves two or three men standing next to each other  the middle one typically speaking  in the worst case  the other party is represented by one person   also the interviews the reporters have are very artificial  sometimes even unprofessional  for example sometimes the discussion is between the reporters  i mean  from a point of the interviewed   akward  moreover the interview persons always stay calm  they say everything without normal emotions  i e  you cannot tell whether they lie or not  are mad or not  they show almost nothing   this is also very unprofessional  the  christian  reporters always believe everything they are told by the people they interview   bottom line   all conversations contain     facts    pro con arguments  there are no lies  nobody lies   the next sentence is a spoiler  ignore if you still plan to see the movie  the only lie happening is to demonstrate how  bad  non believers are   this makes me conclude that the movie is a b movie  it is very similar to  plan   from outer space   from the  s  but this movie also has an annoying  wrong set discussion about aliens and christian belief   note  i have no intention to insult christians  people who believe in aliens or whomever else  this is a thought i have about the movie  not about people   moreover i would like to note that i don t know whether the actors are bad or were just given terrible scripts
