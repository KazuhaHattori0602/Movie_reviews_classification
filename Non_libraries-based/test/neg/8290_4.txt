 graduation day  is a result of the success of  friday the  th  both of those films are about creative  bloody murders  rather than suspense  if you enjoy that type of film  i d recommend  graduation day  if not  i wouldn t  there s nothing new here  just the same old killings   even though i ve given the film a   out of   i will say that it s not a repulsive film  it is watchable if your curious about it  just not creative
