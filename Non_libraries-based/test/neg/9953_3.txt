for reasons i cannot begin to fathom  dr  lorenzo cameron  george zucco  begins injecting wolf s blood into his dim witted handyman  petro  glenn strange  the result   petro is transformed into a hideous  as hideous as someone with a bad wig and pointy teeth can be  killer beast  dr  cameron uses petro to get his revenge against those in the scientific community who scoffed at and ridiculed his ideas  and why wouldn t they  dr  cameron s nuttier than a fruitcake   overall  the mad monster is one dull and poorly made poverty row thriller  there s really only one positive i can come up with to write about in the mad monster  george zucco can be fun to watch as he plays the mad scientist about as well as anyone  his dr  cameron is a regular loony  he has no qualms about killing  he has entire conversations with people who aren t there  and  as with most mad scientists  he messes in  god s domain   actually  i m not sure anyone accuses him of this  but it fits  but beyond zucco  there s nothing here to recommend  everything else from the monster effects to the supporting cast to the music is plain old bad  there are far better examples of poverty row horror from the  s than the mad monster
