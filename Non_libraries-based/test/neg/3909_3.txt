if you re one of those people who doesn t really like sci fi because of their sometimes far fetched ideas and surreal world perspectives  you better stay away as far as you can from stuart gordon s space truckers  it truly is an absurd space adventure  stuffed with eccentric characters  colorful kitsch and ludicrous plot twists  in all honesty
i probably never would have cared for this film  if it wasn t for gordon s name on the credits  this guy comes pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre  with undeniable milestones like  from beyond  and  re animator  on his r sum  apparently  stuart gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible  he already went completely over the comedy top once  with re animator  but  with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there  something that isn t really the case for space truckers
most of the gags lead nowhere and the entirely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses  in the end  all that remains is an occasionally amusing but completely unnecessary mess  dennis hopper and charles dance  or at least a semi charles dance  are always a joy to look at and the still stunning barbara crampton has a small role near the end of the film  crampton was stuart gordon s regular heroine in previous horror films  the story of space truckers is as silly as they come  dennis hopper plays the self made loner who s fed up with his job  who wouldn t be when you re transporting pigs across the galaxy for a company named interpork  he sees his change to flee while bringing his muse to earth  they float into space pirates and find out their cargo is meant to wipe out half the universe  stuart gordon wisely returned to making horror again after this little escapade  since space truckers  he already made the sublime `king of the ants  and the absolutely brilliant `dagon
