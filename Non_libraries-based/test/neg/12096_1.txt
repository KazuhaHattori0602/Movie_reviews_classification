this is perhaps the worst movie i have ever seen  and i have seen well over   movies in my lifetime  the acting atrocious  the only bright spot seems to be judging the anatomical prowess of the female castmembers  after watching this movie  it is suggested that the viewer not operate heavy machinery or go driving for a period of at least   hours  also a bottle of valium would be recommended so you don t feel so bad for the   wasted minutes of your life  the plot is nothing original  the dialog excruciating  and even the weapons seem sub par  do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn whatever copies they have of this horrid film
