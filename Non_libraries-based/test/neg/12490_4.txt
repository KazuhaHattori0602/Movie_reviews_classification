dear mr ram gopal varma  i don t know in which capacity i am writing this letter to you  i am a never say he s finished amitabh bachchan fan  having sat through his cock chasing act in jaadugar  i also demand some important designation in the godfather fan club  having watched the coppola classic more times than you have delivered flops from your factory  and  of course  i have been a big admirer of yours  right from the time you had nagarjuna wrapping the cycle chain around his knuckles in shiva   when you announced sarkar and called it your take on godfather  all one wanted to know was the date the first look would be out  the sunday the promos would go on air  the friday the film would be released  it was sheer wish fulfillment at work knowing that you  and not someone hovering between the mustard fields of amritsar and the tulip gardens of amsterdam  had taken up the task of recreating the puzo pages on the bollywood big screen   your cast couldn t have been more you   working for the first time with the legend  casting abhishek as his screen son  giving kay kay a role he has deserved for years  bringing back forgotten faces like supriya pathak and rukhsar  and picking complete non actors like katrina and tanishaa to join the list
 before july   you had made sarkar the most awaited film ever for any godfather freak who worshiped bachchan   the opening credits stoked the hope that your stunning sepia tinted promos on the telly had kindled  but now  you labeled sarkar your tribute to godfather instead of the word  inspired  which you had been using all along  probably you don t want the two creations to be compared but when the medium is the same  then a kaante would be compared to reservoir dogs and a reservoir dogs to a city on fire   also  when your first and last sequences   the heart of any screenplay treatment   are all about the establishment and the transfer of power  you can t keep the nagares and the corleones apart  even if you replace the american mafia moves with maharashtrian political power play   but you got it wrong  mr varma
 you wanted to show amitabh in his  s avatar  as rustled up by the pens of salim javed  you wanted him to lurk around larger than life  you wanted him to be his own brand o  then how could you steal his voice in the name of using silence  how could you keep him rooted to his chair in the hunt for interesting camera angles  how could you leave him stranded without his voice and stature  the two things that have made his b so big  coppola s godfather cameraman gordon willis masked brando s eyes throughout the movie because it didn t have the power to match that drawling husky voice or that sudden snap of the fingers  but you tried to repeat the malik act from your very own company  but bachchan is no ajay devgan   his forte doesn t lie in the stagnant stare and the suffocating silence  you made the man look like a comatose patient  who s reminded from time to time to look at the cue cards and mouth those predictable one liners  for that  agneepath s there  any given saturday   which bachchan fan would go and watch kay kay menon stealing the thunder from under his nose in the scene where sarkar asks vishnu to leave his house  which amitabh aficionado would go and watch him focus on achaar and carom  in a film that talks about power with a capital p in the promos  we can t handle so much in the name of restraint and understatement  you don t even allow the camera to rest on him for five seconds when he learns that his son wanted to kill him  give me the old school camera only on bachchan style  any given saturday   kudos to you  of course  for making an actor out of abhishek  first in naach and now in sarkar  you also allow him to show mallika sherawat that he can run as well as his father  even in the short prison sequence  you really make the bachchans come out of the text  an opportunity shaad missed in bunty aur babli  wish the film could have been more a father son story rather than a chaotic conflict between caricatures in the name of characters  who pop up like the ad windows on the internet   you also let the women more into the script than puzo and coppola did and again  you deserve all the brownie points for squeezing them in so effectively  pathak is a welcome return as the mother in the middle  tanishaa lovable as the lovelorn girl  katrina a revelation as abhishek s confused lover and rukhsar s silence speaks volumes   but sub plots do not a classic remake  when your free flowing camera tries to make every frame look hatke and your loud background score irritates incessantly  we keep getting reminded that we are in a factory  well  maybe not a nino rota score but sarkar certainly deserved better than those govinda  govinda chants and uncalled for flute interludes   mr varma  some of your factory directors tell me that you are involved with every project  from overseeing the shooting schedules to supervising the editing sessions  perhaps  in the middle of all the various storyboards  the bhiku matre scream is being muted by the subhash nagare silence  perhaps  you need to bring the shutters down on the factory and work on a single homemade product  otherwise  your products would remain products  to use and throw  not treasure  and movie buffs like me  for whom there are no hits and flops  only good cinema  would rather choose a film without factory finish  any given saturday
