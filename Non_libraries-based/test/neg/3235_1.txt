i still find it hard to believe that a fine   if overlong   novel by dean koontz was transformed into this utter excrement   this movie is so bad it s disgusting  boos to all who participated  shame on you   p s  the fact that sequels have appeared just goes to show how little taste and discretion remains in silver screen land
