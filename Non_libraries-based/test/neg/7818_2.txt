for years i hesitated watching this movie  now  i know why  it was even worse than i d expected  ashton kutcher makes the worst movie mistake of his career  since  dude  where s my car  tara reid co stars as the girl of ashton s dreams  who asks him to babysit her father  and his boss s pet owl for the weekend  the rules    no shoes in the house    no people in the house    the boss  son stays out of the house    don t touch the furniture   well  you can pretty much guess by the end of the first twenty minutes  how the rest of the film is going to turn out   you know  there are films like   meet the parents  where bad things happen to someone  but it s entertaining to watch  and it s delivered in a way  that you can t wait to see what happens next  this  is not one of those films  you know right from the start that bad things are going to happen  and they re mostly stupid things that would never actually happen  it s an extremely frustrating movie to watch  and there were about three times when i nearly turned it off  because it was so bad  but  i paid the rental fee  and figured i had to watch it now   tara reid was good  and i would like to see her in more films  though  i m not surprised if this had a hand in hurting her career   the end result is a happy ending but of course with the kind of film it is  you would expect nothing short of that   don t watch it  you ll sincerely regret it
