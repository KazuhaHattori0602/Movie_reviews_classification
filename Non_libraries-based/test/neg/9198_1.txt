if you pack all the clich s about city firefighters into   minutes  you have ladder    it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clich s  it turns it into movie that with every event  becomes so predictable it s not worth watching  there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial   it looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious  the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obvious   it doesn t compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel
