sorry randy  i love your comedy but in this case you really laid a  golden turkey  egg   the plot was thinner than a single layer of my skin  the acting more wooden than a giant redwood and i think the direction was non existent   there certainly appeared to be pathetic attempts at take offs of other films  jaws and european vacation to name but two   if memory serves me right eric idle played the same type of character in nat lamp european vacation  but much better   i am wondering if chevy chase and beverley d angelo were approached to make this sequel  if so  they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down   in my opinion no one can better chevy and beverley in their roles as the griswolds and randy quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier movies   randy quaid should have quit national lampoon whilst he was ahead
