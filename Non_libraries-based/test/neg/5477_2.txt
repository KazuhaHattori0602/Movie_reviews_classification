this should have been a moody  gritty  movie which lingered in the memory as an exposition of relationship where the dominant personality only survives because the personality being dominated sees no hope of change   the acting was intense and skillful  the dialogue worked but the movie was irritatingly ineffective  too many distance shots that suggested lack of focus rather than a broader picture  poor flow  the first   minutes could have been missed out altogether   i suspect that  with a different edit  this movie could have been compelling   in its current form it is flat  formless and tremendously disappointing
