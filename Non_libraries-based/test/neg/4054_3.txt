the tender hook  or  who killed the australian film industry  case no    this sorry excuse for a period drama takes a cast and idea with potential   rose byrne  pia miranda  hugo weaving  in a jazz era gangster drama   and turns it into a sloppily paced and executed soporific  mcheath  weaving  is a boxing promoter and gangster and functioning illiterate  for no apparent reason he s given to singing bob dylan and leonard cohen songs before bouts  how post modern  how stupid  anyway  there s a boxer  art  matthew le nevez  who becomes mcheath s latest prot g  over his unfortunately aboriginal stablemate alby  luke carroll   mcheath s flapper moll iris  byrne  makes the goo goo eyes at him  sexual tension squelches under the surface  miranda plays daisy  a friend of iris s  these flower girls stick together  who keeps turning up in scenes unannounced  they practice dancing together and talk about  hooking up  with guys  in the  s  i stopped counting anachronisms after that  there s a subplot involving japanese beer and a backstory of broome pearl fishermen  i don t know what it was all about  for some reason that is not exactly  at all  explained  byrne puts cocaine in art s lemonade  mcheath thinks he s a drunk and sacks him  byrne plots and schemes to help him out again  she s a big one for the plotting and scheming  most of which causes trouble  mcheath s two gunsels  portly ronnie  john batchelor  and russian donnie  tyler coppin  debate bumping off mcheath when he realises their part in one of iris s schemes  but ronnie wimps out when he sees mcheath crying  a lot of practically incoherent scenes get in the road of the film finally ending   director jonathan ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer geoffrey simpson creating some pretty images  but utterly fails to generate a sense of style  which might have compensated for and decorated the wispy  pathetically underpowered script  unfortunately ogilvie s sense of film grammar  the lack of structuring of the scenes and exposition  is stunningly incompetent  in an early scene  daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists  how she got there  and indeed who she is  seems to have slipped ogilvie s mind  there are many more examples of this sloppiness  where he chases poetic sparseness  he achieves only wan irritation  he gains awkward performances from actors who are normally reliable  badly miscasting weaving and leaning on byrne s ability to project a kind of haunted doll like humanity whilst saddling her with an incomprehensible character   it might not matter so much if the story had more substantial characters and stronger plotting preferably not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with witlessly sprinkled pop culture quotes  but it doesn t  it s boring
