who the heck had the  bright  idea of casting lucille ball in this film  it should have been angela lansbury s baby all the way  at the very least lucy should have had her singing dubbed    there is some compensation in the fact that jerry herman s score is pretty well kept intact except for  that s how young i feel  and we do get performances by the original broadway cast members jane connell and bea arthur    i suppose robert preston had to be given a song  hence the inferior  loving you    overall  i think in this one the wrong redhead was cast
