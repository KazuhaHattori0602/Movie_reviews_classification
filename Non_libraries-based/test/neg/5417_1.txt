wow  i thought  eskimo limon was the most awful and embarrassing first sex movie ever  but i had forgotten that germany always tries to compete  in this case  the well known german film producer bernd eichinger was successful in producing even worse crap  harte jungs is stupid  not believable and predictable  and above all  not funny  it s almost a tragedy that so many kids went to see this in germany  and  i m afraid  also austria   tobias schenke    looks too nice to have no girlfriend and too ripe to be   and his character is too dumb to be true  schenke tries real hard to make us believe that he doesn t know anything about sex  but that doesn t help  harte jungs seems to be made by someone who watched al bundy and took him too seriously   the best actors in the movie are sissi perlinger and stefan j rgens who play schenke s semi liberal parents  perlinger and j rgens are stand up comedians who are not particularly talented in movie acting  still  their performances are the `best  and `funniest  in comparison   a complete failure
