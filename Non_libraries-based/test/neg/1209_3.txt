it s hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn t produced once  but four times  most movies require a certain `suspension of reality  to enjoy  but this one takes it just too far  the basic scenario is an air force pilot who is shot down over a `middle eastern  country  the us government drags its feet in recovering him  leading the pilot s son  doug masters  to attempt a rescue mission   the problem i have with the movie is that it depicts the us air force as one colossal joke  in the movie you ll find that doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two f s  all the munitions  the fuel  the intel for the mission  and so on  security on this base seems to be a joke  nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteen year old kid is fully qualified to pilot an f   if that wasn t enough  you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right  since people like to see things `blow up  not so  several times in the movie  doug fires off aim  missiles on ground targets  aim stands for `air intercept missile  meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the air  he also fires off   missiles  where the maximum an f  can hold is   aim s  the movie also lacks continuity  you ll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions  and in the next scene  it has a totally different munitions package  also   mm doesn t just completely destroy anything it touches  an f  will hold   rounds of  mm  and it s mostly used for self defense   i could go on forever with plot holes  flaws  and outright wrong information from the movie  but i won t bore you  if you re in the mood to see a good air force movie  your choices are rather slim  most military movies deal either with the army  navy or marines  until hollywood can come up with an air force movie on the lines of `saving private ryan  or `a few good men  we ll be forced to watch movies like the `iron eagle  series
