we found this movie nearly impossible to watch  with such a super cast  it s a shame that the writing and direction were so awful  the excruciating pace at which the story was told was maddening  the flash backs were clumsy  the characters were one dimensional  the heavy handed metaphors   the river  the cat   were repeated way too often    the movie nobody s fool  based on another novel by russo  was infinitely better  probably because it was more tightly written and directed    the photography in empire falls was lovely  too bad it wasn t a travelogue   i read the novel and enjoyed the writing style but had some quibbles with the novel itself  i would give the novel   out of   stars  perhaps the screenwriters and director were so awed by the novel s reputation they felt they had to include every darn thing in their movie  this was supposed to be a television movie  guys  not books on tape
