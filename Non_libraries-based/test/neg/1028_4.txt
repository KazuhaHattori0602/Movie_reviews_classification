i guess only a selected number of audience members really had any interest in watching how a male hustler in new york operates but i d be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by the irritating patchwork technique and deliberately muffled sound recording on display here  the fact that these inherent  defects  were a direct result of the film s low budget underground experimental nature is  i d say  beside the point  anyway  for those so inclined  the film features extensive male nudity and joe dallesandro  understandably  became an underground   and gay   icon    the episodic structure showing the day to day routine of the hustler protagonist offers a couple of mildly interesting scenes  his meeting with  and eventually posing for  an eccentric elderly artist  the one where dallesandro expresses his views on his unusual line of work and delineates his particular modus operandi to a couple of prospective  colleagues  including perhaps the unlikeliest of hustlers   a bespectacled nerd  perhaps mercifully  the film ran for only   minutes against the imdb s claim that its complete length is    but the latter could well be a mistake    i had watched a few other of warhol s  movies  and this one is decidedly not as satisfying as the most tolerable example i ve run into yet  bad   and only slightly better than the likes of my hustler   which were mostly a strain to sit through  the fact that this was only the first part of a trilogy did not augur well but  as the saying goes  you gotta to do what you gotta do and the other two  chapters  had to follow in quick succession    despite my generally negative reaction to it  flesh is nevertheless still valuable as a  s time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that era  both cinematically and in real life  for the record  an image of dallesandro from this film adorns the sleeve of the smiths  self titled   debut album and transsexual candy darling  who appears here rather unremarkably  was immortalized in  candy says  the opening track of the velvet underground s eponymous   album  although the latter band is my all time favorite  and one of the reasons for this is that  through their sheerly unique and ground breaking music  they described a lifestyle so utterly different from my own  this is truly a case where i d much rather experience something aurally instead of visually
