this movie deviated from the bible and fell so below the bar of the   movie  i hate that they replaced the   movie over the traditionally seen   commandments  moses looked like a criminal in this movie  not like the kind looking man charelston heston in the   movie  i will not waste my time again watching this movie  they tried so hard to modernize this movie in order to keep you on the edge that it was more like a soap opera  and not a good one at that  i m pretty sure that younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original   commandments may disagree with me  but to each his own  also  it took them   years to make the first   commandments  it probably took them   months to make this one  the special effects were not as amazing as the first one and after all these years with so much technology  you would have thought they would have done better now
