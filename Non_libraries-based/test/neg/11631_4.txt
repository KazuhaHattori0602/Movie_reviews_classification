oh my god  after having such a promising start  critters   reiterated the karmic rule of what goes around comes around  clearly  very few things were thought out when this movie was made  and what was up with scott grimes wearing an earing  this should have been the last expedition into the critters saga  but more garbage was on its way  this was the big reason why i didn t watch critters   and why is every bad film series has to have an episode in space   critters  friday the  th  leprechaun in space  hellraiser  etc
