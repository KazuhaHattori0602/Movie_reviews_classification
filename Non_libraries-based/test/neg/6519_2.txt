this film attempts to cash in on the success of richard curtis movies  particularly  love actually   which i loved    a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples    it s a great idea poorly executed  the script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn t resonate  most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors   the version i saw  on a plane  was called  scenes from a park  which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a  sexual nature   i was so looking forward to this movie  but ultimately it is disappointing  don t bother
