this is a woeful hollywood remake of a classic british film  everything that made the original  italian job  entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie  scripted  by donna and wayne powers and listlessly  directed  by f gary gray  i am amazed that troy kennedy martin  the screenwriter of the original film  allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig s ear  martin has worked on some of the finest film and tv projects of the last  odd years  even being vaguely associated with this stinker is not a good thing   the humour is forced  the drama is laboured  all the characters are cookie cutter likable crims  with the exception of charlize theron s implausible  beautiful safe cracker rally driver and the plot only matches the original on the following points     three minis  the modern bmw made versions  but minis nonetheless     use of the names croker and bridger for   of the main characters    disrupting a city s traffic control system to provide a safe route through it     er  that s it   otherwise  what you get is a bland and implausible american by the numbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate  believe me  it feels like an awful long time before they do  the cast do their best with what they re given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turd polishing exercise after reading the script  none of the original film s quirky nature and distinctly british flavour has survived being fed into the hollywood hamburger machine    do yourself a favour and watch the original   movie instead of this sucking chest wound  it s a wonder that noel coward hasn t done an aunt nelly  jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats   italian job  more like italian jobbie
