  news forum  it is about a page and a half long  some things in the movie i can let slide  but others were unforgivable  the three stooges were geniuses  and a lot of today s comedy is based off of what they did  don t believe me  check out the simpsons  and more so ren   stimpy  but this film fails to capture their genius  it more so inaccurately captures their hardships  which is important  but if the title of the film is gonna be the three stooges  it has to portray their ingenuity and originality more than anything
