bad plot  bad acting  bad direction   it had possibilities but just didn t achieve anything   this film looks like someone started with an idea  googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music   others had to stop watching because they were scared   of the way through   i had to take a break purely because i just didn t care anymore   reminded me of an episode of days of our lives with marginally more suspense   just bad
