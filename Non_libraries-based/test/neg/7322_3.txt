this film makes about as much sense as an  ozzie   harriet  or a  father knows best  episode  an old copy of reader s digest  circa   would provide more insight into modern life  or the relationship between a father and a daughter  than this weird concoction   i was surprised with diane keaton  she appears to sleepwalk through the film   given the film s title  i realize that hers was a supporting role but even martin short managed a distinct  supporting character   i can understand the attraction of an imaginary world created in a good romantic comedy  but this film is the prozac version of an imaginary world  i m frightened to consider that anyone could enjoy it even as pure fantasy
