what a shame that some good talent was wasted  this is a tedious and overly self conscious movie  that could tell its story in half the time  is that derek jacobi under that beard doing two roles  gosh  who would have guessed   the emotional payoff a the end was weak and unsatisfying  certainly not worth enduring the padded length of the movie for  i felt quite let down   the sound was dreadful  first  they used stock music  second  it was so loud during some of the dialog  that the words were hard to make out  only three sound crew  and a trainee  there were more people listed in the credits for either the accounting or the legal   some of the camera work was quite good though  and the actors did a good job with a mediocre script   not a good use of viewing time  at least for me
