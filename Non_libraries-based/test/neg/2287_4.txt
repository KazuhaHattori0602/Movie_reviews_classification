this is more than just an adaptation of bond  it s a plain rip off  with mediocre character sketches that ian fleming would not have approved of  this film goes down as the worst   movie  an older  even haggard  connery tries to relive his past   years later  the result is a humourless  tacky version of the classic hero  give me roger moore any day
