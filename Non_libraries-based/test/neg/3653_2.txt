i had looked forward to viewing this movie  it seemed anyone who had seen it loved it  i was completely disappointed  the acting was so overdone  the script seemed like the writer had gathered   different scripts from various movies and randomly chose dialogue and pieced them together to form one plagarized script   spoilers  was any cliche omitted in this movie  there was a mobstyle hit  homosexuality  prostitution  a serial killer  a fire  numerous godfather wannabees  the main character in love with the prostitute  cross dressing  torture by the police  hannibal lechter style mutilations  i could go on and on   line s like  the godfather wannabe to the prostitute    ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum   i don t want u to work anymore    ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek   who would pay the rent if i didn t work   unrealistic scenes  we never saw a single policeman during the serial killer scenes  yet when the main character disappeared his father was taken in by the police and tortured for weeks   the only way i can make sense out of this whole movie  is if the version i had scene was severely edited from the original  i definitely do not recommend it  and would greatly enjoy discussing it further with anyone who would care to do so
