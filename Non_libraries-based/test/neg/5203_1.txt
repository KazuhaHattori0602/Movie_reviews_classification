as a huge fan of the original operation delta force  i thought i d pick this film up  i figured it couldn t be too bad  however  here s a list of things i learnt from watching operation delta force   deep fault     the delta force  despite being the elite in american armed forces  are mostly mildly overweight men in their late  s and early  s     the delta force  despite being the elite in american armed forces  carry standard police issue pistols or ak s on their most important missions     the delta force  despite being the elite in american armed forces  haven t learnt that during stealth missions  wearing bright red ski jumpers and running around in open spaces aren t exactly going to keep you out of sight     when you drop a molotov cocktail into a tank  it explodes externally like a grenade     when you get hit by tank fire  you can run away  although the smoke caused may present minor difficulties for breathing     you can die from one standard gun shot  but you can also live despite being hit multiple times by a sniper rifle  and a few times by an ak     in hand to hand combat  members of the delta force  despite being the elite in american armed forces  are regularly pummeled by railroad attendants     if bad guys are approaching you while on a slow moving train  there s nothing to worry about   between the   of them  they can t manage to figure out how to get an automatic weapon to fire automatically  let alone hit anyone from   metres   feet  with at least   attempts between them     if you re short on actors  just recycle them   the bad guy from operation delta force   plays a good guy called mac in operation delta force   and the guy who played mac in operation delta force   now plays skip lang  a different good guy     it s not ok for the delta force to shoot an unarmed terrorist  even if he s attempting to reload his weapon to kill you     grenades explode on impact with the ground when thrown by members of the delta force  when thrown by non delta force personnel  they explode at exactly the point where the delta force members have thrown the grenades back at the bad guys     tanks can drive faster than standard trucks     militias and personal armies use the exact same chopper that the un used in operation delta force      when a chopper arrives  a bad guy in that chopper cannot see you if you lie face down     shooting someone multiple times in the chest will cause minor damage  stabbing that person in the knee will kill them inside   seconds     the delta force steal cars from old people to get around when in foreign countries  because the us military do not provide them with any means of transport  this may also explain why they caught public transport   as you can see  this is not really the finest moment in film making  but it s good for a laugh
