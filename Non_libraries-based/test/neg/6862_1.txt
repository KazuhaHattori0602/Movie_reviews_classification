i remember seeing this film when i was about   one of my friends had it  at the time it was just a film as i was about  ish and just thought of it as another action film   when i look back now as a complete film buff this is quite a shockingly bad film  whoever produced this film i am sure had a short hollywood career  although the lead actor seems to have done a few films according to imdb  albeit i haven t seen any and don t really remember him too much   anyway  just to say that this film is really bad  in all ways it could be  i would love to see it again though  od
