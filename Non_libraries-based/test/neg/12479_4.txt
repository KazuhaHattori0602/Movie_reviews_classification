there are certain horror directors for whom i ve built up so much respect   admiration over the years  that they can t possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film  lucio fulci is surely one of them  but damned  he s trying to disappoint me with his later efforts  you can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films fulci directed or produced during the late  s and simply watch  cat in the brain  instead  because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than seven other fulci flicks  including the sickest murders sequences featuring in  when alice broke the mirror  as a whole  this movie definitely ranks among our director s weakest and most pointless achievements  the script is incoherent as hell  the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there s absolutely no suspense to enjoy  i love the title  but it s actually quite meaningless  there is a character named alice in the story  but it s only a supportive role and she certainly doesn t break any mirrors  i suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice  as she s an opera singer  but she doesn t  the plot revolves on a middle aged and gambling addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money  lester parson butchers the ladies  as well as unwelcome witnesses  in gruesome ways  makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat  there s also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him  the difference between  when alice broke the mirror  and some of fulci s greatest horror films  the beyond   city of the living dead  
  lies in the fact that he totally doesn t bother to create a horrific atmosphere  the characters  lester included  are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted  like it s the most common thing in the world to put a woman s head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car  the lighting is poor  the cinematography super ugly  the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable  if i didn t know any better  i would think lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it  the obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore   bloodshed  because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn t work properly  as long as lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women s feet   when alice broke the mirror  is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment  but other than that  there s isn t a whole lot to recommend
