this is only the second time i have been moved enough to write a review  unfortunately  both times they have been for movies that can be described with several   lettered words that can be defined as faeces or excrement  the other movie of such calibre was masked and anonymous   anywa  onto the review  there are several key things wrong with this movie which i will describe below     steven has lost the plot  i e  in all his other movies  family   friend gets killed  steven gets angry  steven kills people  the end     steven has run out of money  there was a good car chase scene at the start  but i think he blew his budget on that and couldn t afford a decent script writer or editor     steven no longer appears to do his own action  instead  the  from memory    fight scenes were shot neck down and from the back  so you couldn t actually see his face  most likely a stunt double  i m guessing chuck norris   in summary  worst seagal movie ever  second worst movie i have seen in recent history  and i ve seen a lot of bad movies
