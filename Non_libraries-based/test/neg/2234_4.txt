this is the second addition to frank baum s personally produced trilogy of oz films  it s essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures  although i consider it preferable to the others because it s shorter  as in the other films  there are performers in animal costumes  an adult woman pretends to be a boy  and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camera work is static  this time  at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes  and the boy played by a woman is made a king   most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning  fairies are represented by multiple exposure photography  and  there s a man in the moon that looks just like those made by georges m li s years before  most famously in  le voyage dans la lune    m li s  imaginative fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early cinema  and the films he made around the turn of the century were far better and even technically more advanced than this trifling oz series
