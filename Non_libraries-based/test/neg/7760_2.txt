yes  i couldn t stop yawning  nor could my partner  incredibly boring     minutes seemed to stretch to at least   hours   and i m not even a fan of action films  but this just falls asleep on its feet   unless you are a  s polo neck sweater fan      some spoilers follow   if you were expecting anything to happen  don t hold your breath   it doesn t    but seriously  it totally fails to convince or involve the watcher  it s like a long  boring and rather disjointed dream  frederic floats through it  able to leave work whenever he wants  and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and messages constantly  obviously not real life  and an office with virtually no paper or files   just a giant calendar to let you know that the film really is taking   months to watch    frederick never seems to be touched by any real emotion  neither does his wife  and the children behave like rag dolls   in stark contrast to any real life  even chloe  despite her strong views  never gives the appearance of really feeling anything  the only   seconds of any real feeling occur between a couple overseen in a cafe  and have nothing to do with the plot   okay  so maybe there are some moral considerations  but if it s entertainment  or even good cinematography you are looking for  i think this film is incredibly over rated by most other viewers
