completely agree with other review   i watched this movie for about   minutes  i looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn t even a real sequel  this was after i slowly backed away from the tv with remote in hand  jaw dropping lower and lower    the quality of the filming is beyond low budget  it doesn t even look like a freaking movie  if i were watching  home video  footage from a documentary i would expect it   in summary  avoid  avoid avoid  boooo lion s gate   completely ashamed of myself for watching   minutes and i hope that i ve saved others from renting or owning it
