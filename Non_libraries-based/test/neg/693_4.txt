wrestlemania   is the only wrestlemania thank god  to be held at three different locations  and while it was an interesting idea  it didn t really work  there are only really two matches that really struck out  with the rest being decent  or most of them  pretty terrible  there are some entertaining celebrity s on hand  like susan saint james  ray charles and cathy crosby  but the experience was a waste of time for the most part  the british bulldgos vs the dream team match  is worth the price of admission itself  but you can honestly see that anywhere   matches   nassau coliseum   paul orndorff vs the magnificent muraco w mr fuji  for the time it had  and despite the crappy finish  this was surprisingly bearable stuff  with the crowd being really into it  crowd chants  bullsh t  at the end  that being said it did nothing for either s career  match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring     intercontinental championship match  randy savage c  vs george  the animal  steele  not that great wrestling wise  but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved  and some great comedy from steele  besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting  savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes  for leverage          jake  the snake  roberts vs george wells  for a throwaway match  this was better than it should have been  but it s too short to make any impact what so ever  roberts wins with the ddt  pulling out the snake afterwords  which disgusts saint james          boxing match  mr t w the hati kid joe frazier vs roddy piper w lou duva bob orton  a huge failure in my opinion  i was bored senseless throughout this  and while it may have been a marketing success  it certainly didn t succeed at entertaining me  lot of rowdy chants are noticeable as well  t wins by dq  when piper slams t      rosemont horizon  women s title match  fabulous moolah c  vs velvet mcintyre  ends too quickly  before it even gets a chance to start  making a record for quick pin fall  as far as woman s matches are concerned  moolah wins when she takes advantage of velvet s missed splash from the top rope     corporal kirchner vs nikolai volkoff w classy freddie blassie  big pop for the corporal  stupid match up  with boring offense from both involved  while being much too short to matter  corporal wins when he whacks volkoff with blassie s cane      battle royal  william perry and andre get the biggest pops  this is pretty entertaining stuff  despite all the nfl talent involved  it s also noteworthy for bret hart s  st ever wrestlemania appearance  andre wins when he chucks the hart foundation out          tag team titles  british bulldogs w lou albano ozzy osbourne vs the dream team w johnny valiant c  absolutely tremendous match  that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time  you won t have time to catch your breath  with all the maneuvers on hand  and the excellent in ring psychology  this is pure wrestling at it s finest  you cannot call yourself a wrestling fan  if you dislike this match  bulldogs win when dynamite kid collide s heads with valentine     los angeles memorial sports arena  ricky steamboat vs hercules hernandez  pretty decent match up here  with both men putting on solid performances  hercules is a nasty brute  with above average skills  and it contrasted well with steamboat s high flying style  steamboat wins with a high flying cross body off the top rope          adrian adonis vs uncle elmer  terrible match  with annoying comedy involved  the fans love uncle elmer  but i do not  adonis wins with a top rope maneuver      the funk brothers vs tito santana jyd  pretty solid match here  with a lot of memorable bumps taken from terry funk the one through the table was something else for that time  i would have to rate this as my  nd favorite  funks win with help from jimmy hart s megaphone      wwf championship  hulk hogan c  vs king kong bundy  decent pop for hogan  one of the most over hyped matches in wrestlemania history  hogan can t wrestle worth a lick  and bundy is not that great himself  the violence was brutal for the time  but hogan s superhero act is kind of annoying  and there are too many boring moments  hogan wins when he escapes before bundy      bottom line  wrestlemania   is a failure in most aspects  die hard wrestling fans should see this once  but you really don t have too  there isn t enough here  to satisfy a true wrestling fan  vince blew it on this one  don t be fooled by the hype of the main event  it really is a boring affair  like most of the card  not recommended  and ranks as one of the worst wrestlemania s  outside of the brilliant tag title match
