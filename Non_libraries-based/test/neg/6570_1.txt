when i first saw it   years ago  when i was   i thought it stunk  i m   now and i still think it stinks  i mean geez no special effects or anything  it was boring and kinda anti climatic  my cousin watched once and george takai  sulu  kept talking about how it was supposed to be so much better  but they kept cutting to the budget  it would have been a great episode  but it was a terrible movie
