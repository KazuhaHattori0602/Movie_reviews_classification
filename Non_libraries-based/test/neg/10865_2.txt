okay  so writer director larry bishop obviously has some important connections and knows the right people in hollywood in order to produce his own film and fill up the cast with eye catching names  good for him  now what he really still needs is inspiration and talent in order to come up with an actually worthwhile scenario rather than the overly pretentious and wannabe convoluted crap he penned down here   hell ride  isn t a movie  it s a hectic and hopelessly inept fan boy endeavor to bring homage to the notorious biker flicks of the  s and to the recently revived grindhouse cinema formula in general  with  hell ride  larry bishop embarrassingly fails in his set up and there are many obvious reasons for this  he hasn t got a story to tell   or at least not a very interesting one   but gravely tries to cover this up through numerous redundant plot twists  loads of gratuitous and very women unfriendly sleaze  overlong and piteous dialogs aspiring to be cool and giant amounts of senseless violence  the plot looks complex but can actually be summarized in one sentence  the ancient vendetta between two rivaling biker gangs flares up again with the arrival of a new member  a boy who may or not be the long lost son of a double crossing wench that got executed back in   that s it  seriously  all the rest  going from betraying gang members over to the recruitment of old timer members over to toying with his nymphomaniac informant girl  is all completely pointless and confusing padding material  another major problem in  hell ride  is larry bishop s very own tremendous and seemingly insatiable ego  he definitely shouldn t have rewarded himself with the role of tough and relentless gang leader  as that only comes across as incredibly pretentious and narrow minded  especially when there are so many other and more experienced stars in the movie  granted  bishop starred in a couple of genuine  s biker exploitation movies  like  the savage seven  and  angel unchained  but that was a long time ago and he honestly isn t any good as an actor  maybe it simply was bishop s life long dream to play a character that always outsmarts his enemies and for which every hot babe sexually craves  and just wrote a whole screenplay around it  the veterans in the cast  like dennis hopper and michael madsen  don t really bother to leave a plausible impression and i can t say i blame them  this whole production is lame and pathetic and i can t bring myself to recommending it to anyone  regardless of many beautiful babes parade around with bare breasts and naked butts
