one commenter said if you like austin powers you will like this movie  i liked autin powers and was disappointed with this movie  the film works hard  maybe too hard for laughs  maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny  i get where they were trying to go with this flick  a cross between zorro and the scarlet pimpernel but it just doesn t work  austin powers if silly but intelligent  zorro the gay blade lacks the savvy of austin powers  the big lebowski or kingpin   i kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script  my   year daughter also thought the movie was flat  my   year old who selected this flick on it s title  walked out after   minutes   it seems many people on imdb liked this film  but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy
