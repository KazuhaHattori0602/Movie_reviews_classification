a formulaic story with all the tired cliches  i was shocked that the horrible script became a movie  what a waste  how many original scripts are scattered around without being produced     at the climax i could predict what will happen in every single shot    oh  and don t even get me started about the idiotic sexual tension between the gorgeous female cop and the paralyzed cop who can barely move a finger  yeah right  i can buy that  what next  fingers porn
