after seeing the movie in a class of mine and having a talk with the filmmaker  i found out exactly why the film bombed the way it did  the creators of the movie had no intention to call the film  mm   originally  the film was called  the velvet side of hell  but was changed at the last minute by sony pictures to  mm   without letting the filmmakers have any say in the matter  by doing that  it screwed them out of theatrical releases and doomed it to a straight to video release with minimal advertising   again  this is from the filmmaker s mouths  not mine  so i really can t say what is truth  and what is hype   if you look at the film as  velvet side of hell  it isn t that bad  it isn t great  but it is not god awful  it would basically just be a b movie that likes to show boobs  but as a sequel to  mm  the film fails terribly
