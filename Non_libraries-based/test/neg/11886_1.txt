this film tells the true story of escaped black slaves who found their own mountain top commune as free men in  th century brazil  the story is interesting and edifying  however  this film   as a film   is terrible   the soundtrack is not period music or tribal music  it is afro brazilian pop music from the early  s  battle scenes are fought to the sounds of cheesy pop rhythms best left to the disco or bad cops dramas  admittedly  the lyrics are folk ish tales of the slaves  heroism  the special effects are absurd  rather than invoke the mysticism of african religion and atavistic beliefs  they merely make the film look cheap  they are completely unbelievable  and i don t mean merely in a sense of verisimilitude   life within the commune of palmares could not have been the way it is portrayed in the film  for this society  as shown in the film  is one part kibbutz  one part afro pop festival  moreover  it is almost embarrassing to watch the director play upon the clich s of blacks as talented singers and dancers who simply want to be happy  he portrays daily life as a series of dance parties in which the freed slaves paint themselves bright colors and whirl around to the strains of  s pop music  on the other hand  they have an abundance of beautiful food  but the viewer hardly sees any work being done  the king inveighs against private property in a hackneyed and clich d way  when a man complains that people are taking the vegetables that he has grown over many months  the king says   what comes from the earth belongs to everyone  as the earth belongs to no one  if they need food  they have a right to take yours   i am glad that i learned about this episode in history  but i am relieved that a film with such low production values and that trades upon such worn stereotypes would likely not be made today
