i hated the first movie is really boring and we only get see the octopus at the end    the plot dead bodies are being found in the new york harbor  the police have no clues nor suspects until nick and his colleague realize the killer is a giant octopus  everybody  especially the police captain  refuses to believe nick s story  and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for the  th of july celebrations   in this movie we get to see more of the giant octopus and special effects for this movie are really good for it s time   the acting is this movie not bad but not great too but okay and watch able    the are some really cheese scenes to movie but if can get past that  you should enjoy the rest of movie
