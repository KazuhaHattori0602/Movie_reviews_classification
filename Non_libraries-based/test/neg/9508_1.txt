  the play has been heavily edited and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed up  the acting is appalling  especially by helena bonham carter  and the cinematography poor   the result is a slow  confused  boring film which will put those new to shakespeare off shakespeare instantly   if you can t see a stage play then at least see the olivier version   instead of this drivel
