thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption i ever made   drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough   not only is the plot thin  but i get more emotional acting from my pet fish   it was a shame to see pete postlethwaite  whom i respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with   i think that a cardboard cut out of stephen baldwin would have done a better job   and in fact have been more animate   avoid at all costs  this could really be hazardous to your health
