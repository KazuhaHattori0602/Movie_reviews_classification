i couldn t help but look at the time every   to   minutes because i found this movie a total drag  childish humor  cheap looking sets  cheap looking effects  a plot that makes  legally blonde  look like  the usual suspects  and so many coincidences that i can now officially say that robert rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after   the only thing he left as his trade mark are some cool camera moves  but there s where it ends  ok  so the guy decided to do something new for a change  a children s spy movie  well if i were   i d feel insulted  the best thing in this movie is the absolutely amazing carla gugino that just stole every scene she was in  sadly  there weren t many
