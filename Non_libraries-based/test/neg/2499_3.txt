d amato s hardcore horror hybrid doesn t really live up to its extraordinary title and intriguing premise  wherein various vapid contemporary types are attacked by a monster on an atoll previously used for nuclear experiments  but for the most part the film is so slow  the action so dreary and the cast so clearly repulsed to be having to have sex with each other that the film becomes a chore to watch   this is a pity  because the film sets up a promising idea  a group of scientists are taken to the atoll by a naval officer in a small vessel  the scientists   three women and two men   are an intriguing cross section of sexual types  suffering to various degrees from nymphomania  co dependency and frigidity  there s even an intriguing foray into the world of female sex tourism  where one of the women stops off at a brothel to get serviced by two hunky caribbean studs for hire  the creature himself   a mangled native islander with a horribly scarred face and an unfeasibly long pizzle   bears some affinities with the old creature from the black lagoon and is the kind of nuclear nightmare that has hovered over postmodern man since the cold war commenced  despite those of us in the west having retreated into hedonism and relativistic science   porno holocaust certainly is a film which shows the post sexual revolution westerners coming across their mirror image in a nuclear monster  yet the torpidity with which it unfolds really lets down the fierceness of the idea  there is a promising interplay of action shots with pov shots  which suggest that the monster  who looks stalks on as horror monsters from their pov position tend to do  is akin to the voyeur in the audience getting off on the sex between the  beautiful people  the sight of the monster forcing a gorgeous young woman to suck his over sized member certainly throws the target audience s ugly fantasies in their face  but d amato has developed similar ideas better in other films  and porno holocaust is a potentially fierce idea let down by the execution  even d amato s usual cinematographic skills let him down with much dreary camera work
