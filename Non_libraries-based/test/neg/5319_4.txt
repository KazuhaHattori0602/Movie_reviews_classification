peter hunt started out as a very gifted film editor and got his first stab at directing when he helmed the james bond film  on her majesty s secret service   considered by many bond fans to be the best of the series  other titles in his filmography include epic scale adventure movies like  gold  and  shout at the devil  both adapted from wilbur smith novels   gulliver s travels  is an odd one on his list of films  it seems strange that a director of hunt s style and expertise would choose to direct a film of this kind  a half live action half animated retelling of jonathan swift s classic satire  the film looked twenty years out of date even when it was made  and in all honesty it simply doesn t work  and there s not a damn thing that hunt  with his usual eye for fast paced action  or star richard harris  who can usually enliven the most stilted of roles  can do to rescue this one   lemuel gulliver  richard harris  is a brilliant medical student living in  th century bristol  his father  norman shelley  wants him to go to london to make his fortune  but gulliver prefers the idea of receiving rather less pay but a heck of a lot more adventure as a ship s surgeon aboard a ship called the  antelope  during a voyage  the  antelope  is blown off course during a storm and hits a reef  the ship sinks and everyone is lost  apart from gulliver
  who finds himself washed ashore in the kingdom of lilliput  when he comes round  gulliver finds that the strange land where he has washed ashore is populated by incredibly small humans  no taller than his toe  to them  he looks like a giant  they persuade gulliver to help them in a war against another race of tiny people who live on an adjacent island  but gulliver doesn t like being manipulated for purposes of war and devastation  so he makes plans to escape
   harris is left to carry the entire film here  his first couple of scenes involve other actors  but once he is shipwrecked in lilliput he spends the rest of the film striding over knee high sets and acting alongside his animated counterparts  the idea of mixing live action and animation was not new at the time  but it certainly hadn t been done a lot  a few disney movies like song of the south  so dear to my heart and pete s dragon had tampered with the idea  but it was still pretty much in its infancy   gulliver s travels  is not an especially well animated film  but the scenes showing interaction between harris and his cartoon co stars are at least competently done  occasionally the film tries to be true to its satirical origins  there s one scene where we learn that lilliput has gone to war with its neighbour because of eggs     and the point seems to be that wars can begin over the most ridiculous of things  but at its heart  this is very much a kids  film and the satirical overtones are barely dwelled upon  everyone involved has done better things during their career    gulliver s travels  might fill an otherwise empty afternoon  but apart from that it is a forgettable and underwhelming experience
