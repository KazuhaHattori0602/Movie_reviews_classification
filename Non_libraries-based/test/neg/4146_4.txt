i cannot believe that this is a film that i did not like      i usually find that i am open minded about all sorts of stuff      but this flick is just  well  bad   i could deal with the subject matter if the script and story were better  i could deal with the acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better established      i think it mostly boils down to script and direction though   it was just bad   i want to give this the lowest rating  but       i don t believe in that  at least this guy got off his tail to make a movie      so he gets four stars  just above the average rating which this has so far
