i saw this film last night  a satire of the reality style programs that seem to be making the rounds at the moment   what can i say  i absolutely hated it  about as interesting as watching paint dry and with maybe one or two only slightly amusing moments   maybe it had something to do with me definately not being a fan of the survivor and big brother type shows  but if this had been a video dvd or if i d been watching at the cinema on my own i would have definately not endured more than the first   minutes
