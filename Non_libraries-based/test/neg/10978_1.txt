i found it hard to care about these characters  who were either annoying or insipid  all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives   the dialogue was excruiciating at times  and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow   was it me or were entire scenes deleted   it felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film  the stereotypes and jokes about  men s groups  would perhaps have been funny in the early  s  as it is  this is where much of the humour of the film comes from   and boy  does it get old fast   apart from the attractive irish man   this film was a dud  and not even in a  so bad it s good way  the last   minutes were particularly painful  perhaps if you ve never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before  then this film might have something meaningful to say  otherwise   darlings  you d still be better off renting the boys in the band or beautiful thing
