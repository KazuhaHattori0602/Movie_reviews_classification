roll up  roll up  it s big gay bruce and his big gay death cannon  plausible plot  unnecessary  decent acting  unnecessary  respect shown to its mighty progenitor  unnecessary  yes it s another offensively stuffed turkey in the butch bruce canon   i mean where do you start with this film  okay  let s begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was  in some way  related to either the book or the original film  the day of the jackal  it s not  in fact it s so different  and so bad  that fredrick forsyth asked to have his name taken off it  now i m not necessarily a stuffy brit who can t hack hollywood remaking british films  well  okay  maybe i am a bit like that  but fortunately it s a redundant point in this case  this film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive   now let s move to the premise  cheesy russian gangster gets killed in a moscow police raid  somehow involving the fbi although no one bothers to explain why  in revenge  brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the us president  although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move   although to be fair it was pre  so he wasn t to know it would have resulted in the us airforce carpet bombing eastern europe  gangster hires  nasty  killer  willis  police hire  cuddly  killer  gere   cuddly  killer tracks  nasty  killer  police fanny around and periodically get killed   cuddly  killer kills  nasty  killer  first lady is saved and we all realise that the ira are just this bunch of real sweet guys y know  who just happen to want to kill innocent people  nice   let s put to one side the distasteful hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of northern ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park  i deal with this point more extensively on the message boards  if hollywood directors want to cast the belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold  that s up to them  i  of course  reserve the right to despise them for it  it s a free country   more egregious  however  is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the irish while trying to support them  that s not politically distasteful  it s far worse  it s incompetent  it s no wonder  for instance  that gere still looks so damn good  given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra p  the fact that gere s accent is not only southern irish  but an appalling parody of southern irish shows that the filmmakers weren t looking much beyond america to make money from this film  then there is that lovely scene at the end where sidney poitier  a complete waste of space in this film  says he s off for a coffee  offers to get our  cuddly  ira man one  then casually says  ah  but then you guys drink guinness don t you  yeah that s right sidney  the irish live on guinness and potatoes   while we re on the subject of poitier  why  in the original film the detective is the tracker  in jackal  gere is the tracker  so what does poitier do  well  he just hangs around and looks like a tw at of course  he s got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end  and he only does this because the nice ira man tells him to   while we re on the subject of gere  why  i suppose it s only a matter of time before hollywood remakes gandhi with vin diesel playing ex mujahideen commando mahatma gandhi beheading his way through  s and  s india  he is  after all  a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a muslim fundamentalist  let s not forget that gere s character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work  and if he s not  why does he know the jackal  if he s not  why does he know all his moves  and if he is  why is he such a limp biscuit and such a  loveable  person    all this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn t be bothered to  a  think about the plot  b  have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character c  avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend   i honestly thought this had turned into a bond movie  d  give the  central  characters something to do  e  credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence   this film is an insult to the british and irish killed at the hands of terrorists  it s an insult to the irish people  it s an insult to not great  but pretty good film it rips off  and an insult to the intelligence  but most of all   and most unforgivable   it is an insult to my a rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish  honestly  you d think with no plot  no characters and no dialogue  it would be over in no time  but they didn t even have the decency to quit early
