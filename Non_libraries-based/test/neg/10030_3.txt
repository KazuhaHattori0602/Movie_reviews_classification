the prey has an interesting history  unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of   you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer   but little else is remembered  the plot is your basic killer in the woods again  but ironically this was filmed before friday the  th  the prey was actually shot sometime in   according to one of the actors in an interview years later  but released for about a week at some drive ins   yes jim  namans drive in showed this in june of   but it has a dated look to it  maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by   now on the story  it has some kind of back story  a forest fire back in the  s leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death  but one of their children survive  our monster  so flash forward to present day which would be   we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster  the tag line for this picture claims its not human  and its got an axe  but an axe was only used in these first two killings  now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid  s camping  we all know they are the prey  and the monster knocks them of one by one  for an   minute movie it seems longer  we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the   mins  overall for being out into an  s horror movie it looks way more  s than ever  hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short  it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end  and we have to wait till the last   minutes to see him  side note  the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the  s
