this is truly  without exaggerating  one of the worst slasher movies ever made  i know  it came out in the  s following a tendency started by  friday the  th   the prey  copies the fore mentioned movie in many aspects  the woods setting  the killer  the dumb teens  the gore  etc   but  the prey  is as bad as you might expect  i didn t even remember about it if it wasn t for coincidence   well  the killer is in fact human so don t expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason  the situations rather boring and lack of tension  gore  violence  etc  it just does not works for a slasher flick   the acting is simply horrid  the score is horrible  a combination of boring instruments with cheesy  s tunes  i won t even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me  it seems that it cost only   dollars   please avoid this one like the plague  it s one of the worst movies i ve ever seen  and that s something to say  thank god it seems to have vanished from earth
