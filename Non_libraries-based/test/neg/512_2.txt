i think vampire movies  usually  are wicked  even if the film itself isn t all that good  i still like it  cos its got vampires in it  but this stinks  it really does give vampire movies a bad name   for a start  the cheapness really shows  i m not usually that bothered about low budget films   one of my favourite all time movies is el mariachi which only cost     but i hate this  the actions a load of crap as well  resorting to a  stylish  wobbling camera which gives you headache   theres not much more to say other than don t watch this  i bought it for   as it was an ex rental and i feel cheated out of my money  even for that low price
