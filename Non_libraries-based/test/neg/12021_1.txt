everyone has their choice for  worst movie they ve ever seen  some like to pick on gigli or battlefield earth  some pick on classics like plan   from outer space  ever since i was   i have been very vocal in saying that to me  it is problem child   and   years later  i feel the exact same way  it s not  one of the worst  it s not just an expression  it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen   how much farting  pooping  peeing  and puking can you put in a single movie  i don t need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist  why is it that i m so hard on this filth  i have nothing against bathroom or gross out humor  heck  i like the american pie movies  having such an excess of it within   minutes is a bad idea  but the true tipping point is to do it with kids  having little kids call each other sexual names  imdb won t even let me post that word on here  yet here it is coming out of the mouths of   year olds  think of the irony in that  and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier  worst line in the movie   i guess i should fart in more people s offices    what other film has  urination into lemonade  dynamite sticks exploding toilets  a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house  and a little girl joking about scratching testicles    however  my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride  says   i m gonna puke  opens her mouth  and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect   degree angle  the puking scene in scary movie   looked more real than that    i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert gottfried  you get the impression that he didn t even have a script  but was just being his usual self  too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him   you know what  thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom  goodbye
