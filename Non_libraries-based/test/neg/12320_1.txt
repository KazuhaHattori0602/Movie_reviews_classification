inappropriate  the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the mpaa  whale rider gets a pg  but this movie gets a pg  please  parents don t be fooled  taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake  there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids  but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary   but all that aside  the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie  the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces  the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable  or hateable in this case  alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this  the kids are conditioned actors and it shows  especially with dakota fanning  fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen   did i mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie  mike myers is absolutely deplorable  i didn t like him as the voice of shrek  and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children s films ever again  his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers   in the end  the cat should not have come  he should have stayed away  but he came  even if just for a day  he ruined   minutes of my life    minutes of personal anger and strife   the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever
