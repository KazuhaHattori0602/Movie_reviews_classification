the beginning was decent  the ending was alright   sadly  this movie suffers from complete and utter shallowness of the characters  unrealistic confrontations fight scenes  lack of anyone intelligent outside of the shuttle  this makes for an awful middle screenplay    stuff to look for  overly obvious foreshadowing  fast healing cuts  overly smoky fires  fun seatbelts  delayed reactions   i did give it a   not a   because the start of the movie had some nice elements of happiness and basic character development  the relationship between the main  dark haired girl and her fianc e is touched upon briefly  and the placement of the blond friend s impact on that relationship is present  though awkwardly so  the business discovered at the end is becoming more mainstream and decently done  though  as another commenter pointed out  not unexpected     viper
