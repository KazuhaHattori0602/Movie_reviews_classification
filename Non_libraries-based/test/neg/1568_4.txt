george and mildred is a truly unfunny film  this attempt to translate the successful tv series to the big screen was a dismal failure  as is so often the case   the wit and clever one liners from the tv shows have gone missing  the plot is a typical english farce of confused characters and mistaken identities  which is neither funny enough nor weird enough to provoke many decent laughs   die hard george and mildred fans might want to see this final episode of the pair s output  mildred died of hepatitis before the film was released  but others should invest their time more wisely
