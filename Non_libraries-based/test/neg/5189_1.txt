about   minutes into this lame excuse for a movie  i realized it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who re always telling really lame jokes or doing extremely unfunny things  because they think it s funny and are trying to entertain everyone    this film is billed as starring traci lords  she s not that bad of an actress  but her lines aren t funny and she s not the star  the acting is some of the most god awful i ve ever seen  except for lords  the girl who plays casey  and maybe the colonel who seems oddly out of place  i can t imagine why a retired military colonel would want to start a snowboarding academy  do those even exist   the budget would ve been better spent coaxing these women into doing a full length porn feature     freddy got fingered  currently has a   score   frostbite  has a   i m baffled these two movies are within a   to each other  fgf is  the godfather  compared to this garbage     stars
