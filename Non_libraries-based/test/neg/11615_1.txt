the most self indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to  rent  unwatchable  much of the movie is obviously improvised   and not well  it looks like toback took the first take of  everything  the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when  robert downey jr  shows up  then goes to hell again real  quickly
