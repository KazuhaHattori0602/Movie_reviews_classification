the worst part of all is the poor scripting  leading to superficial acting   dreyfuss  character is intensely repetitive and annoying  and dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match   holly hunter s character is exaggeratedly self centered  and hunter herself indulges in serious overacting  as usual   brad johnson was wooden  john goodman made the best of it   furthermore  the whole death   ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone  and now appears rather lame    barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes
