this is a poor film  it certainly belongs in the how not to make a feature film category  story  direction  acting and style are all flat as a pancake  story consists of five   yes five   football matches spread out over the film s duration  each one more boringly filmed than the last  as a dysfunctional amateur football team go from strength to strength  that s it  that s the plot  it s hard to know who this film is aimed at  it s too banal for football fans and there s nothing in it for teens nor grown ups  there s nothing in it for women either  there isn t even a single female character  it s dreariness wears you down as the team play game after game after game after game after game  the story  such as it is  dialogue and mannerisms seem lifted from a bygone ireland  with all the actors spouting cod theatrical dublin accents  it doesn t have to be seen to be believed  avoid at all costs  can someone give me back my   minutes  high point the credits at the end  low point too numerous to mention  brendan gleeson is in this film
