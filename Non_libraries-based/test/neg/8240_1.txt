this season lacked real oomf  but  as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again  season   is without highlights and spontaneity   this season lacked its usual sopranos style  and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season  you probably would have had   episodes worth of real stories   side stories like pauly s mom  is she or isn t she  was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character  i would have like to have seen bobby express his anger more at pauly in that carnival episode  but to no avail   and that s just it  these side stories had no real purpose  and lack finishing  if they are going to finish off these stories in the next   episodes  i d rather not watch it  because  its not really worth seeing   disappointing is to nice a word to say about this season and its finale
