as i sit back after watching wong kar wai s   movie ashes of time   more specifically the   re edit and re release with the word  redux  slapped on the end of the title   i wonder what went wrong  i wonder why the film just didn t work out at all  i wonder why the movie failed to score any major points in my book  in particular  what was it about the film which dragged it down  and made it the director s worst film of his career   well it s not too hard to figure out really  let me just say that it truly is a shame that kar wai so abruptly went down this hell hole of mediocrity and poorness in moviedom  especially considering the fact that in the same year he released chungking express  one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film  so   what went wrong  it would be suitable to consider ashes of time as somewhat of an experimental film  our director essentially places his own inimitable style of film making and places it in an entirely different setting  mood and atmosphere  what results is a catastrophic film which is all over the place and simply does not work out  hence  it would be even wiser to call ashes of time a failed experiment  bold  audacious and innovative  but a failure nonetheless   let me elaborate  those who have seen the films of mr  kar wai  a hong kong born film auteur who s made his mark on the art house world since his debut in the late s  will know that there is an overriding aesthetic which binds all of his movies together  essentially and frankly speaking  they re all colourful  thought provoking  amiable  subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life  love and loss  the same formula is transposed into ashes of time  however  the regular setting of hong kong is ridden of  and in its stead we re placed into the setting of ancient china  and the land of the legendary martial arts warriors and clansmen   intertwined into this quasi adventure historical caper is the typical kar wai love story  this time involving an elegiac hit man who has moved to the middle of the desert  and is carrying out contract killings  however  i must stop myself there  description of characters is a useless thing to do  why  because not a single character in ashes of time is worth mentioning or nothing  what a bland cast  and what a waste of talent  the case of ashes of time contains nearly all regular kar wai collaborators   not only that  but the film is essentially endless incessant rambling in a horrendous  almost non existent narrative structure  one of the main reasons why detractors of ashes of time berate it is because it seems to possess no plot whatsoever  let alone a semblance or an indication of one  you can definitely see what they re getting at  even from the first two  three minutes  maybe less  of the film  perhaps it s just the atypical setting of ancient china which is unaccustomed and inappropriate for kar wai s typical film making style  i like to think  however unfortunate it may be  that mr  kar wai just stuffed up big time here   one thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in ashes of time  albeit said compliment being starkly isolated  is another director trademark   wonderful  colourful and blissful aesthetics  what joyous colour is composed on screen  what glorious textures are painted for us  and what breathtaking landscapes and imagery are captured for us throughout the entire movie  we can at least take this as a sign that wong kar wai is still there at heart  and it s just the film which is so atypical  and buries his usually commendable nuance  although the visuals aren t enough for us to fully absolve kar wai for this disastrous venture  they re enough to make the film worthwhile   and at least we don t walk out of the movie in a completely and totally cantankerous mood  now that there s something we can think of nicely   the film is essentially a  wuxia art  film  following in the style of  say  legendary japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa  however  one thing differentiates kar wai s film from kurosawa s best  and that s that in the japanese director s films everything gels together and simply works  in ashes of time  nothing seems to work  kar wai s attempt to make a genuinely profound wuxia film  let alone an intellectual and provocative movie in general terms  is a futile endeavour   kar wai claims that making ashes of time exhausted him  and that he needed time to clear his head  it must ve certainly been a fatiguing effort on his behalf  as his exertions are embodied in the film and transferred to us directly   i mean  just watching the film is an exhausting effort  and now i need time to clear my head of this unpleasant movie going experience
