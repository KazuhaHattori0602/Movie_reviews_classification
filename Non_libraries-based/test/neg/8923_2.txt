i usually spend almost as much time writing my reviews as i do watching the film  but with today you die  i feel that doing so would be a criminal waste of my time   so here is a five minute rant about how bad this film is   there was a time in the mid s when a single look from steven seagal was enough to crack your ribs  a full on scowl could knock you off your feet  if he actually got a hold of you  he would snap you like a twig   these days  although he is still capable of doing considerable damage  he no longer looks the part  he s gone to seed and just doesn t know when to call it quits  he walks like he s dumped in his pants yet somehow still manages to look constipated  and he has put on weight  his trademark long ponytail has gone  but his hair still looks stupid  how this man keeps on working in the movie industry is beyond me   today you die is the usual seagal mix of bone crunching fights  car crashes  gun battles and pyrotechnics  seagal mumbles his way through the dull script  delivering his lines with zero enthusiasm or believability  in this third rate action flick  he plays harlan banks a thief trying to go straight  who is conned into partaking in a   robbery  he gets caught  goes to jail  escapes  and seeks revenge  yawn   there are some pretty good car chases and gun fights which intersperse the boring stuff  of which there is a lot  but reading other comments on imdb has revealed that these were actually borrowed from other better movies  seagal is also body doubled an awful lot in this one   seagal turns in one of the most dreadful performances of his career and that s saying something  considering the lousy  acting  in some of his recent efforts  most hilarious is his totally embarrassing attempt at ebonics  african american street slang   i da man  fo  sho no  actually steven  you sound like an arse  with a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere  this film is a waste of time  money and effort  and the final moment  where harlan banks saves a children s home from closure is enough to make you blow chunks   damn  i just looked at the clock  i was enjoying trashing this steaming pile of dreck so much  i went way over my five minutes  it s time to post this comment and get to watching something decent
