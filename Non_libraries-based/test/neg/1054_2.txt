this is your typical junk comedy   there are almost no laughs  no genuine moments  no memorable lines  no scenes where you think to yourself   that was clever  nothing  the plot is embarrassingly bad    it s ugly to look at and boring as hell  there is no substance here  this movie has nothing  it doesn t matter if farely was in this or not  a crap movie is a crap movie no matter who s involved    also  david spade is a terribly unfunny comedian who plays the same lousy character in ever movie tv show that he s in   this movie was dead on arrival  there is no life here  no fun  no intelligence  there are plenty of other  dumb  comedies more enjoyable that this one  this film is just pathetic
