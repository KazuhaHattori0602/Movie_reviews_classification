frederick forsyth s books are always so intricately plotted  with twists and turns  and usually a great surprise ending  this adaptation had none of that   so much of what was great in the book  the history of monk and the betrayed agents  the plot to influence the outcome of the russian election  were completely missing in this adaptation  instead  there s this completely new plot about bio weapons that was a yawner   forsyth s protagonists always operated in the shadows  forever just slightly beyond the reach of the antagonists  the joys of his books have always been the machinations of carrying out their mission  this film resigned itself to gunfights and car chases early on   swayze s monk might as well have hung a sign around his neck saying  i am a secret agent  for all the attention that he called to himself during the film  and with all of that attention  the amount of time that it took the bad guys to catch up to him was surprising   granted there was some energy to this film  which is why i m giving it a   instead of a   it was also great to see some underutilized pros like patrick bergin  ben cross  michael york  and barry morse   i hope that someday  someone will once again do justice to a forsyth film adaptation like  day of the jackal  did
