i went to this film full of hope  with so many capable and humorous actors headed up by sir ben i thought this is going to be a little treat   oh how i felt like gouging my eyes out as the credits rolled  that i had wasted  mins of my life this film that was clearly doa  there are some real problems with this film and it will probably be easier to list them    no jokes  i am not particularly hard to please comedically   high or low brow   but there really is not one laugh in this film     sir ben mumbles through every single line whether he is supposed to be drunk or not    there is no effort to to begin let alone develop the relationship between the love interests in this    people bumping into each other randomly in the street would instantly have more rapport     all the acting talent that is assembled is completely wasted  don t be fooled into watching this because of the names     for a cold ass hit man he rubbed out more people in gandhi than this flaccid waste of time  a by the way dyed beards look really creepy  i was hoping that this was a slow burner but in the end the only thing that could inject any life   and justice   into this is frank pulling out his   and offing the whole cast starting with tea and ending with himself   sorry it was that bad
