was this supposed to be funny  this is one of those films that just doesn t work  the first one  bruce almighty with jim carey  had some very funny moments  this one had none   steve carrell  who was brilliant in bruce almighty  fails to deliver here  his performance is very ordinary and he can t carry it off like carey did   the one good thing about this is i only paid   to rent it  it s a movie for children very young children who have only seen about   films or so in their short lives   it s interesting to note that where jim carey stars in a film and they make a sequel without him that it s usually a huge turkey  anyone remember son of mask   imdb worst   films of all time  avoid this one movie lovers
