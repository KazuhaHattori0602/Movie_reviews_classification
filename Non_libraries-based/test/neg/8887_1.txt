the chupacabra  according to this mockumentary  is a mysterious  creature that has been killing and eating hispanic goats in latin  america and mexico for years  one has crossed the border into  southern texas  and a cute  intrepid cryptozoologist  no  i did not  make up that word  go to an isolated ranch to find one  her uncle  was killed by the creature  and some grainy video footage of the  monster exists  she takes a badass black guy with a gun and two  cameramen  for easy to edit coverage  and they go ahuntin  for  chupacabras  ten minutes into the film  they find it   the rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting  attacked by the bloodthirsty monster  and stilted dialogue  at one  point  the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them  to the chupacabra s nest for   if only the fbi knew about how  cheaply tex mex witches could be bought as informants  whole  decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a  blank check   in the end  after the bloody deaths of characters you don t give a  goat s patoot about  a chupacabra is captured  killed  and  autopsied  the only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the  makeup department s efforts in such a cheap film   the film is shot on video  just like  bwp  yet the cameraman  characters never reload their tapes or recharge their camera  batteries  the lead actress here is awful  the beauty of the  average  bwp  was its use of improvisation during the production   here  all the lines are written  and are delivered like a poorly  rehearsed christmas pageant   the film is tinged with racism  as well  the only african american  here is a loudmouthed gun nut  at one point  as the crew breaks  into an abandoned house  they find a trio of illegal immigrants who  comically ask them if they are from the ins  chortle  chortle   the monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit  and nothing more  for  such a lumbering and awkward beast  he is able to sneak up on  the cast pretty quietly  whether they have idiotically locked  themselves in a giant cage as bait  or cannot seem to get their  only vehicle started   the gore is gruesome  but when surrounded by this kind of  stupidity  it loses all of its effectiveness  i do not know if this was  shot before or after  bwp  but i can honestly say this is the worst  film ever made in southern texas about a mythical beast  pray  there are not any sequels  i will start a letter writing campaign to  troma   this is rated  r  for strong physical violence  gun violence  strong  gore  and profanity
