granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made in the history of cinema   the script was diabolical  so bad in fact that i was almost crying with laughter at some of the things they came out with  the acting was almost as bad  they would have been better off casting traffic cones to play the roles  they would have done a better job  the murders were laughable  the suspense was non existent  the camera work was ineffective and the  major  plot twist at the end was disgustingly inappropriate  it just gets worse and worse    the granny  is possibly one of the most unthreatening  villains  caught on film  she looks like she is wearing a cheap mask from the supermarket  the nylon hair caused endless amounts of laughter  and a frilly nightgown  would you be scared by that  i certainly wasn t   if you like watching bad movies  see manos  troll   michael bay films     then this is a must see  those who don t like bad movies and don t enjoy laughing at shockingly bad dialogue  avoid like the plague
