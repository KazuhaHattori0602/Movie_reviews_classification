although this has to be the nadir of season six  this schmaltzy episode isn t badly written or acted  it s just that most of us looked to the x files for taut  gripping horror thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies  season   gave us a stream of tongue in cheek comedies that undermined the show s continuity and  frankly  made simpsons  halloween specials look like great thriller tv   in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long suffering girlfriend of a man who sets himself up as a rainmaker  however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town   there s some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none too sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks  it s nothing you d want to see more than once   it s hard to figure out season   x files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole  syndicate conspiracy  story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers
