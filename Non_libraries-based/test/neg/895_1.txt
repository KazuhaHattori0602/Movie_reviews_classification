i know it sounds crazy but yes  i am a huge fan of house party   and    and proud of it  i hated part   and then here comes part   i was like are you kidding me with this  kid  n play are nowhere to be found in this movie  and that would ve been okay  had they not foolishly entitled the movie house party   as if it was in any way  shape  form  or fashion related to its predecessors  every time this movie comes on late at night on usa  i shoot my tv with a rifle  quite frankly  it really is just that atrocious   hurling   as the only remaining fan of kid  n play that will actually admit to being a fan  tee hee hee  i was appalled  remember that stupid little boy group immature  they snuck their way into house party   okay  fine and well but how can part   be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they re not even the same kids from part    confused  house party fans  do yourself a favor and stick to house party   and   and class act  beyond that  everything else is ridiculous
