any evening with jonathan ross now means to me his wit in first hassling and upsetting with carefully chosen words a   year old man by phone and then suggesting he and russell brand should house break and masturbate him while he slept as a way to say sorry for making obscene phone calls to him  kinky  and illegal  for a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well  like his boss  or a follower of abu hamza  would he be amused if someone did it to one of his daughters   over all the years i ve perhaps seen less than   minutes of bbc star man ross s chat show because i find him so loathsome  some of the guests i saw were ok though   probably most of them who ever appeared were ok for all i know  as a chat show it seems pretty poor though   what s so chatty about asking tory leader david cameron on this tv programme whether he ever masturbated to photographs of margaret thatcher  he chatted up gwyneth paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted to f  him  however  ross s yob mentality was finally totally exposed with the above revelations  and i thought i d take the opportunity to warn the few decent folk around the world who might not know just how vile this man is and to steer clear of him and his   unless you think all comedy should be  edgy  ie obscene vacuous  we re not yet all the same here  although bbc and channel   are jettisoning all standards   in october   ross with fellow tosser russell brand made a series of premeditated sexual obscene phone calls to andrew sachs  answer phone  manuel from fawlty towers  had it broadcast as intended on bbc national radio against sachs  request and then tried to get sachs  granddaughter to burn the evidence in case they got prosecuted  a significant number of people over here  probably most of them non bbc license fee payers  found it hilarious and or that the national scandal had been overblown  but many people apparently still knew right from wrong and   eventually complained to bbc about the incident  many unrighteous media fools and others snickered about these   never having heard the radio programme  and never wanting to    using their argument they presumably also consider an event such as the holocaust justified because at the time relatively few people complained to the media  and none of us here now should be horrified by it because we weren t there  the   bbc producers initially involved in passing it for broadcast thought it was  very funny and brilliant  comedy and only   people complained about brand s radio programme at the time   which i m afraid only indicated the moral level his   weekly listeners had sunk to with the help of bbc expertise  highly moral bbc tried and failed to use it in mitigation in the later ofcom investigation  roll over aristotle  tell lord reith the news  sachs  agent complained to bbc but was ignored by them until a tory national newspaper got hold of the story  the penalty for any ordinary pervert doing this would normally be sacking and prosecution  maybe even prison  but while brand and the head of bbc radio   were both eventually ordered to resign the multi millionaire ross was given a   week holiday by bbc s boss  i suppose that he asked ross s permission first though if he could dock ross s pay by   to prevent him from suing  to come back to this programme afresh in   before his contract runs out  all that time to think of more smut and or more insulting witlessness for his   viewers to admire   but at least he could still chortle his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits up  some people think that his position will be untenable and he won t be able to carry on  i think his skin is so thick because the stakes are so high that he will come back unbowed and re energised with pent up vitriol   update   i ve just watched the first   minutes of his new series   the  most enormous cock up    to use his referential phrase   is continuing to allow this sniggering unrepentant law breaker to take the public s money like this  but who knows  maybe in the future after the slimy british film   tv industries have comforted him for the moral stance taken by the   and showered him with awards he will become a sir for his services to perversion by the perverts in government  at the least i hope this pair of edgy deviants sign up with other perverted commercial tv and radio stations and stay there  so i won t be paying for their flouting the law and spouting illegal obscenities in the future  in   ofcom fined british tv license fee payers   for this  sorry  affair   thanks ross for offering to pay  not   to the apologists  get a life sense of humour sense of proportion  it s not the end of the world having a pair of talentless perverts as your heroes and there s far more important things to worry about in this world  like the price of real cheese  to sum up family man dross  a comedy genius to apparently millions of people  especially himself  merely a nasty obscene phone caller receiving an obscene wage packet from an obscene multimedia company to others  so much for our society of political correctness and respect  as you should ve guessed  it doesn t apply to the rich and famous and never will  but only to the poor  to sum up bbc  stumbling blindly on from huttongate  campbellgate  dykegate  springergate  crowngate  phonegate now rossgate i hope its next crisis will be abolitiongate  i also hope anyone who thinks comedy should be always challenging and pushing back boundaries ie offensive aren t challenged or offended by my opinion of this particular law breaking pervert  his perverted programmes and his current perverted employers
