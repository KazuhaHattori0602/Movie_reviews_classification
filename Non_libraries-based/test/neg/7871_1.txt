this is   hour and   minutes of pure boredom   in this  action  movie  even the gun baldwin uses  hk g a  sucks  it was sent to recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid eighties  and is now only used by terrorists  bank robbers and military museums   if i had known this movie was this bad  i would rather watch   episodes of macgyver saving the planet   no groove  no drive and no feel  watch the tupperware channel   it s more exiting than this sorry excuse for a movie  this movie doesn t deserve a   on the scale  better luck next time  baldwin  until then  i ll sit here watch my toenails grow   that is far more exiting than  target
