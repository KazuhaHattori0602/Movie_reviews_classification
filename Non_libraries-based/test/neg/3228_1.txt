this is beyond stupid    two high school graduates travel to nantucket for the summer and find situations there that are absolutely revolting   demi moore co stars in this one  as the film was in   was ashton kutcher just a babe in the woods at that time   moore s grandfather has died and his home is on the verge of being sold to ruthless people with a father and son who bring a new meaning to the term mean   bobcat goldthwait  with that obnoxious voice is in the film  as well as two brothers  who make dumb and dumber look more and more intelligent   the writing is absolutely ridiculous  highlights of the stupidity are where one person says to the other   did you ever notice that when people die  they go alphabetically in the papers    i rest my case
