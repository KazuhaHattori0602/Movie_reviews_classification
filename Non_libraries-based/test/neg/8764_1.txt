i watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time  the girl from emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh   like itv made a big mistake with this   bad girls is  times better   i feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time  this show has not been repeated on itv  yeah thats how good it is   i would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money   beware
