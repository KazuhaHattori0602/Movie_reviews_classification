definitely not your typical polizia  redneck just never worked for me  the movie tells the story of a jewel heist gone wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process  in their attempt to get away  the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they hatch a plan to ransom the boy  the plan is never carried off as the robbers are more intent on getting to france and the boy is intent on staying with them  while i could cite a number of problems i had with the movie  i ll focus on the most obvious   the character memphis played by telly savalas  from his work in the dirty dozen and kelley s heroes to other italian films like crime boss to his most remembered role as kojak  savalas was a winner  i ve always thought of him as one uber cool customer  unfortunately  savalas is almost unwatchable in redneck  did the director turn on the camera and instruct him to act as psychotic as possible  it might not have been too bad had his actions been done within the context of a plot i cared about  but here he seems to be acting bizarre for sake of being bizarre  it s appears to be random lunacy  and what s with that accent  savalas might have been a lot of things  but southern isn t one of them  he sounds completely ridiculous even attempting the accent  beyond that  i found little of interest in the rest of the movie  as i indicated  the plot never drew me in  i just didn t care about what was going on  and the notion that the boy is so quickly attracted to the criminal lifestyle doesn t ring true  as for the other actors  mark lester is almost as bad as savalas and the usually reliable franco nero isn t a whole lot better  three  name  actors and not a good performance between them  to make matters worse  i believe the director filmed many of the night scenes with nothing more than the glow from his watch to light the shots  i couldn t tell what was going on  characters i hate  a plot i don t care about  and a production values that failed   little wonder i ve given redneck a
