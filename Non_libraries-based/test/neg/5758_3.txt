this was bad enough  i really hope that there is no sequel  maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility  but no  it really isn t   there is really not at all special about this movie  well  the special effect were fairly good  but nothing to write home about   there were some hot babes in her  especially elina madison and alexandra ford  but nothing to see folks  pg  definitely not an r  that also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular  the shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual   tame scare fare
