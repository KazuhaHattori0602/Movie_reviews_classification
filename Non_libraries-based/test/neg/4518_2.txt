why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews    this is amateurish  unfunny and annoying   the only memorable thing here is the corny title song    the production values are low and the  comedic   if you want to call them that  ideas are weak  they seem like leftovers of leftovers from snl that even they would not dare to have put on the screen   i m beginning to thoroughly mistrust imdb ratings    this is light years away from kentucky fried movie   not even in the same galaxy   it s not even possible to write   lines about it   ok  another good thing  ugly street scenes and ugly people   something one doesn t get to see a lot in todays tv and movies
