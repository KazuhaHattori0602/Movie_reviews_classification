this really is the worst movie i have ever seen  for a while  i made a habit of watching lousy movies  including  battlefield earth   delta force commando  and  starship  all of these movies are cinematic gems compared to ironheart   there isn t much point in summarizing this piece of junk  i think it s more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie  which is as follows  i become furiously angry and i want to rip the tape out of the vcr and burn it after  roughly    minutes of play   i rate this movie a   but imdb does not let one rate a movie less than   i give it a   knowing full well that i am saying any movie that has any score above   is infinitely  undefinably  many times better than this one   that s really how bad it is
