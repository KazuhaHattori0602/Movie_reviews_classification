i gave this movie a rating of   because it is by far  the worst movie i ve ever seen in my life  this movie was made in   and i ve seen movies made in the  s with better special effects  i wish i could go into detail  but words can t describe how crappy this movie was  i could have done better with a home video camera and   i pray that chuck norris never makes a movie again  now if you think i m downing this movie because it has a christian theme  you re wrong  i like the fact that il  chuck decided to make a movie that at least attempted to make god look good  but why would he make poor viewers like me suffer through such a crappy movie  this whole film can be summed up in   words  re damn diculous
