this has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie i have ever seen   however  that is not all that this movie is lacking  this movie has the worst acting  writing  directing  special effects  you name it it s the worst ever   i highly advise you to spend your time on worthwhile movies and not waste your time on this garbage   i do agree with an earlier post that the  women  were definitely men dressed up in drag  and that did give me a laugh  i keep trying to figure out if they were being obvious about it or if they were actually trying to be sexy women   anyway  there is not much else in this movie that is worth watching   to sum it up  horrible acting  horrible script  horrible idea for a movie  an hour and a half of my life i want back right now
