mystery science theater   would have not been able to bring any redeeming quality to a showing of this  gem    this one is like a cheesy pirate copy of  s porn you could have purchased on vhs from an arcade on  nd st  before disney bought the whole smash and closed them all down    but  wait   all the sex scenes have been cut  i challenge anyone to find a worse film  this film could replace water boarding as a humane method of interrogation    no  i take that back   i would prefer water boarding    the only credit this movie could earn apart from being the worst movie ever made would be to threaten the middle east into solving its problems under pain of having to watch this movie
