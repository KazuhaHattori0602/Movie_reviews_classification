my wife rented this movie and then conveniently never got to see it  if i ever want to torture her i will make her watch this movie  i ve watched many movies with my   year old and i can take almost anything  barney is refreshing after a shot of quigley    the plot  dialog  cinematography    acting were one step above  or equal to  a cheap porn film  i feel cheated out of   that we paid to rent it and then   minutes of my life i will never get back  i will say my   year old liked it  luckily it was a rental we had to return right away   i just hope that the younger actor s careers are not ruined from being in this movie
