jerry angell  owner of zombie horror s finest mullet  returns for more undead action in the sequel to director todd sheets  atrocious home made gore fest zombie bloodbath  this time around  jerry plays a sleazy low life thug who  along with his equally despicable partner in crime  some escaped convicts  several teenagers  and a bunch of screaming girls  comes face to face with a horde of shambling  flesh eating corpses   obviously having learnt zilch about improving his craft in the two years since zombie bloodbath  sheets delivers another shoddy mess of a film that somehow manages to be even worse than the original a feat that i thought was almost impossible to achieve  the acting is uniformly lousy  the effects amateurish and cheap  most of the gore appears to be nothing more than a selection of offcuts  offal and blood from the local butcher s shop  the story incomprehensible  as far as i could fathom  the zombies rise from the dead because a scarecrow commands them to  and the direction frustratingly laden with cheap looking video effects and completely meaningless cuts to black and white   and as if that wasn t enough to convince you of this film s complete lack of redeeming features  the simply mind bogglingly moronic ending should do the trick  the few remaining survivors stumble upon an abandoned truck that conveniently happens to have a stash of flesh eating bacteria laying on its passenger seat just the thing for dissolving the undead  but  strangely enough  not at all detrimental to the living
