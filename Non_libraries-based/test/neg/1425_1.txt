not since   heads in a duffel bag  and the  how high  previews  have i laughed so little at something that the film makers thought  would be hysterical   jerry lewis is the richest man in the world  he is rejected as  f  by the army  and decides to use his money to raise his own army   of about half a dozen  he then impersonates a nazi commander in  italy  and eventually tries to kill hitler  that is the description of the  flimsy plot   this film is as funny as a heart attack  this film makes  hogan s  heroes  look like shakespeare  if the money men of  the  producers  had really wanted to lose their cash  they should have  shown this film  i cannot stress how bad this thing is   lewis  direction consists of two different cameras shooting the  action from two different angles  then being edited together  this  sitcom type of direction works on television  but here it is an  obvious attempt to cheat the audience  he ends most of his  scenes with a still shot  as if giving the viewer a chance to double  over in stitches before going to the next tired set up  i spent most of  the movie doubled over in abdominal agony  accompanied with  severe flatulence  over this thing   lewis  the director and producer  sets the film in   but makes  no attempt to use period costumes or sets  everyone wears the  latest style and has the latest interior design for   the  supporting cast is lost as lewis goes off on his patented tangents   which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to  watch  when lewis becomes the nazi commander  he spends the  last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a  performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring  in at the beginning   the final embarassing shot has lewis and his cronies trying to  put one over on the japanese  they wear buck teeth  squint their  eyes  and talk in a  funny  accent  it may be one of the most  blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps  i was  slack jawed at what lewis did through this whole thing  but that put  me over the edge  watch for kaye ballard s very tasteless scene  where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again    star trek s george takei has two small scenes  then wisely  drops out of the picture  this has less laughs than mel brooks  last  three films combined  there is nothing sadder than watching a  formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly  you  actually feel ashamed for them  jim carrey learned that with  the  majestic  but jerry lewis still shows up on television once in a  while pulling the same unfunny schtick  i feel sorry for him    which way to the front  is cheap  unfunny  offensive  and stupid   i feel bad for everyone involved  and anyone who must endure this   i do not recommend it   though rated  g  this contains some physical violence  some gun  violence  and some adult situations  if your child shows interest in  seeing this  please consult professional help
