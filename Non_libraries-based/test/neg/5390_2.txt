most of the other posts beat this movie up  and deservedly so  i ve just got to chime in on the technical ineptness of the film makers  it would have been nice if the director had at least had lunch with someone who knew what a gun was  because he had no clue   spoilers ahead  you have been warned    stupidity    spec ops team assembled from various military units whose members have never met each other before   maybe two people in the unit had weapons that used the same magazines  parts  ammo  etc   the sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun  pistol caliber  as opposed to a rifle which we would assume she would be more proficient with   one poor team member s night vision optics weigh more than the rifle does  you can tell when he handles it  that it is seriously top heavy   the team leader sends out a team member to  challenge  the skeleton man when they first confront him  challenge a   year old reanimated native american skeleton with a long spear and an attitude riding an undead war horse with a severe nosebleed  i think not  bubba   bullets do not spark when they hit trees  mr  director   a couple of people have already mentioned this    the teams  air support  consists of a ubiquitous  black helicopter  only this one has a couple of sidewinder missiles slung underneath  someone forgot to tell the helo crew that the skeleton man doesn t fly  and they are over the american heartland where there won t be any enemy aircraft  they should have carried some air to ground missiles instead   the helo s air to ground ordnance consists of a door gunner with a semi auto ak or   needless to say he only hits dirt  should have brought a belt fed light machine gun   door gunner later finds out that a grenade launcher is pretty useless as well   a wooden arrow from a freaking recurve bow does not down helicopters  mr  director   i pretty well could not take anymore after this point  about   minutes  and gave up  you seriously need a morphine drip to make it through this flick  it is just that painful
