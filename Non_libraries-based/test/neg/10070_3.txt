jp  lacks the spielberg touch  it s an all out assault on the senses featuring  in your face  dinosaurs  watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell    the script is lame  it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered  also  we don t really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all they re worth  for example  william h  macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino thugs for our attention  and laura dern was especially sympathetic in jp  in this film  she s barely a blip on the radar screen   the whole jp  experience was t o o m u c h  too much noise  too many surprises  too many characters dying off  too much predictable  gratuitous violence    word to the wise  vote yourself off this island    i rated it a   for special effects  i took off the other   points for having absolutely no originality
