although i have rarely flown myself  i am keenly interested in aviation  and this film has added to the precious laughing stock in aviation cinema     why is the captain doing the ground checks  why does he even measure the oil levels in the engines  with turnaround times as low as   minutes in commercial aviation this is not a typical pre flight check     why does the captain kick against the aircraft tire  strange kind of pressure check  or anger management      the cockpit has a crew of   all large  western  two engined jets built since the  ies have a crew of   people  now try a guess at how old the movie script is     a helicopter manages to fly alongside the crippled airliner  must be a fast one  and the captain s words to explain the  maneuver  to the passengers are indeed hilarious ones     with arrested elevator rudders it is always possible to lower the nose of the aircraft  it happens  for example  when any aircraft moves slower than the stall speed     the elevator rudders have hydraulic actuators  after the collision with the business plane it would  most probably  have severed the hydraulic lines and thus make them useless for steering  but it would not fix them in certain position     the fire in the aft galley was a stupid idea  it was designed to show that only gentlemen ask for the extinguisher and fight the fire  regardless of who was actually trained to do that   the flight attendant     at the time of collision  the aircraft s elevators would have been in a neutral position  the film could have ended here     the flight engineer  the third person in the cockpit  has three bars on his uniform  in reality  flight engineers have two     why does the captain slash the cabin casing with an axe to examine the damage behind  i thought it would have been the flight engineer s duty  as he is already supposed to perform technical checks before and after flight     in any aircraft  there is no unused space  at least commercial airplanes cannot afford the luxury of a compartment that can be filled with tons of water   i could go on and on  but at last i laughed hysterically about how the screenwriters imagine aircraft disasters  woooohooo  most aircraft disasters happen in such a short time span that you simply cannot make  minute flicks out of them  but you can always fill   minutes with mind boggling and insane crap  irrespective of the genre
