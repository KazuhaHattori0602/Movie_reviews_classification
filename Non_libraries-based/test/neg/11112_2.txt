chupacabra terror    it was the navy seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad  up till then there was a lot of bad movie baggage but the seals
 they are wearing bicycle helmets painted black  you know the ones with air holes that make every adult who wears them look like a complete tool  of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship might have been another clue  it wouldn t make it across tampa bay let alone an ocean 
 and their tactics wouldn t pass muster on an  rd rate xbox game   does director john shepphird have photos of john rhys davies in a compromising position with a hobbit  because i can t think of any other reason he would be in this movie  the other actors have a great excuse  they are talentless unattractive hacks that couldn t get hired for an infomercial  the plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical chupacabra  love saying that name  aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose   the sets consist of horrible cruise ship fakery  complete with airshafts the size of a small apartment  the monster killings are bottom of the barrel  there is no nudity  and a lot of really bad actors refuse to finish their death scenes  of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a  s doris day movie   the cast bleeds ketchup while the chupacabra bleeds day green glow in the dark blood   why a goat eating mexican mammal would bleed anything but red is beyond me   every b movie has a tipping point that makes it a fun time  hey it s a lesbian shower scene  omg that guy just ate is own eyeballs  or not so fun  did they just call those forty something overweight guys wearing coveralls and bicycle helmets navy seals  chupacabra falls into the not so fun b movie side with a thud
