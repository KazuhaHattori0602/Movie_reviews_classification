tagline  the lucky ones died before watching this   i ve never watched a bulgarian movie from  s  so i can t say this is the worst movie ever made  but it surely is the worst movie i ve ever watched  i can t almost remember it   all i can recall is a family of stupid people who don t do anything right  their car has one wheel out of four stuck in the sand  so they decide that there s nothing to do and prepare to live the rest of their lives there  then there s an old man who is aware of the existence of a band of cannibals in the whereabouts but has never considered the idea to report the fact to the police   and  speaking of the police if those freaks have lived around there eating humans for years  lots of people must have disappeared how come the sheriff didn t suspect anything   but i gave up asking questions after the first five minutes or so  the rest is bore  an hallucinated unbelievable bore   i will be merciful and won t speak about the dialogues  and the acting  and the effects   i will only mention the final scene  where the freak girl eliminates a snake  the snakes  they come out in the end  what the hell do they have to do with the story  with a sniper precise throw of a stone  demonstrating the full disregard of mr  craven for reality and for things that happen on planet earth in general   i believe there have been riots when the film was first released in    even being eaten by a cannibal wouldn t be a fair punishment to the director for this attack on intelligence
