trite and tiring  the one liners almost made me cry  my   year old left the room and ended up doing a puzzle  i don t know what age group this was written for  but the writer himself herself didn t even want credit  as for the song  it s mildly amusing  at least it was a decade ago  there are many christmas movies to watch  although i ve seen some many more times than this  they are still enjoyable  whenever this comes on  i try to encourage my child to watch something else  one positive note  that allowed a vote of   instead of   is that it encourages good moral values  that would have been encouraging  if anyone were watching
