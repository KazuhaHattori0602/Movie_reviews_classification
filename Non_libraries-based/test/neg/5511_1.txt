i ve been trying to remember the name of this movie for years  not consecutively  of course  i saw it at the local dollar theater when i was   and it was so atrocious i almost walked out  i think i didn t realize one was allowed to leave before the movie ended  anyway  it stuck in my mind as just about the worst movie i saw growing up  i can finally give it the rating it deserves      that was strangely satisfying
