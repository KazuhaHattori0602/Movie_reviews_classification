this movie was very disappointing  and except for a few moments  wasn t fly at all  more than anything  it was just flippin  stupid  the music was frickin  bad and the plot played out like a byu bowl game   very predictable  avoiding embarrassment by scoring  a late game flurry of touchdowns  a rally that falls short and leads to a loss  in essence  the half childish   half naive will  the movie s fetcher  and his religiously confused brother danny  we ll just call him a democrat  treat kirby  the movie s  sweet spirit  the  rd member of their hapless mormon  boy band  like crap until the man and father figure of the film  the stage manager  jill  has a talk with will and straightens him out  believably  will s personality changes   degrees and he s instantly the mature and self aware leader of the band  this would be a cute  perhaps funny    minute roadshow gig  but the fact that the movie is   minutes long really sucks the life out of you if you watch it to the end  my advise   take the money you d normally spend to rent this show and either burn it in your fireplace or flush it down the toilet   more entertainment with much less time commitment  if you want to watch a better movie of the same genre  get saints and soldiers   not a comedy but an infinitely better show  actually  kirby has more funny stuff in saints than he does in sop
