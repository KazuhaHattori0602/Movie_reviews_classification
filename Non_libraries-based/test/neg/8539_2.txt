just saw this movie on opening night  i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it  i must say  i was not impressed  i m so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money   first of all  the messengers  is very predictable  and just not much of a thriller  it might be scary for someone under   but it really did nothing for me  the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie s resolution   furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial  some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes   if you ve seen previews for this movie  then you ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot  this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters
