watching this film today i got the feeling this thing was missing about   to   minutes or so from the beginning of the story  john wayne rides up on this trading post saloon out in the middle of nowhere to meet with the owner about some robberies  all he sees is the signs of a massacre  some dead bodies  signs of a fight and no one alive in sight  that s because the owner s daughter is hidden in a secret room  the kind you find in old english murder mysteries   the reason you find those hidden rooms in those kind of stories is that they were formerly priestholes  catholic families clinging to the old faith in  th century england built these things to hide those on the run from royal authorities because of their faith  not something you see in westerns  but a good gimmick   unfortunately because of bad editing or writing or both we never know exactly what brought wayne to this place exactly  but this was a b western and not even a good one at that   gabby hayes is in this and he s clean shaven and playing a mute part of the time  an unusual circumstance for the garrulous gabby   if you want to bother and find out what happens and see a whiskerless gabby hayes then see this film
