warning  this could spoil your movie  watch it  see if you agree    to think that we as humans can not learn from the past  the futuristic society portrayed glamorized what hitler believed  obliterate a race of people  in this case men  for the benefit of society  it made me sick to my stomach  also the plausibility of a y bomb is insane  even in war our instinct for self preservation will prevent the extinction of humanity  we made mistakes in the past ie  japan  hiroshima and nagasaki in   but because of that we avoided a bigger mistake in   during the cuban missile crisis
