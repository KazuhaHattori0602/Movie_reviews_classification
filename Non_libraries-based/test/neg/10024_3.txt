uhhh   so  did they even have writers for this  maybe i m picky  but i like a little dialog with my movies  and  as far as slasher films go  just a sliver of character development will suffice   unfortunately  the prey provides neither and if you think i m being hyperbolic  you ll just have to see it for yourself  scene after scene  we just get actors standing around  looking forlorn and awkward  abandoned by any sense of a script  outside of calling out each other s names when they get separated in the woods  natch  the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation orion  clearly plagiarized from funk   wagnalls  scintillating slasher fare  no  and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesn t even have anything to do with the plot  wait  what is the plot  at other times  the prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we can t exactly hear what they re saying  so we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring  deliberately  seriously  i ve seen more dialog in a silent film  it s as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in rancho cucamonga in the heyday of the  s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said   hey  i gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag  let s somehow pad an entire feature around it  and   well  they did    to be fair  the prey probably had some sort of writer on board  i mean  somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies  however  i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever  there are glaring pauses  boring tableaux  and zero sense of pacing throughout  the filmmakers don t have anything else in the  script  to film  so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced  these critters are all filmed in straightforward  noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography  if it feels like a science film  that s because it is  i m pretty sure this is all nature show stock footage all that s missing is a stuffy narration from some national geographic alderman   more exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor  a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches  and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute and a  half  a minute and a half  that s a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with  let alone insert into the final cut of the film  way to go  guys  brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest   admittedly  the film picks up quite a bit of steam  comparatively  in the last   minutes  into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip off of b la bart k s  music for strings  percussion and celesta  cuts in  vaudeville great jackie coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby  bumbly park ranger  this was his last role  if you can believe it  and there are some nice gory moments  including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation  the make up used for the killer  carel struycken  aka  lurch  from the addams family movies  is also quite effective  and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason voorhees and freddy krueger  plus  if you love wacky  straight outta left field endings  you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up  you ll do a spit take  i promise   usually  i love films that are on this level of ineptitude  but the first three quarters of the prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest  overall  this is a largely pallid and tedious affair  and  while it ain t all bad  it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists  why do we do this to ourselves  anyway
