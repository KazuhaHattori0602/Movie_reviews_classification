i was forced to watch  changi  last year in year   australian history  looking around the class room  both classes  all   students were nearly asleep  all   heads on the table whispering to the person next to them  i refuse to believe that because i am only   that my opinion doesn t count  having studied world war two  i not only felt embarrassed and ashamed watching this australian piece of trash television  i was out of my mind at the appalling effort this mini series applied in the usage of film elements  the acting was poor  the screenplay was very inaccurate and the score was dreadful  please  do not watch this film  it is bias and very racists  to the japans
