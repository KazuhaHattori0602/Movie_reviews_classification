what can be said about this  truly one of the most mind numbing experiences of my life  your brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation  i was left shattered from the experience of watching this  film  and i took a good two hours to fully recover  this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  i mean this in a terrible way  a terrible way   this film has no redeeming features  everything is appalling  artless camera work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable  i e  lots of corn  lots of mud  the story is beyond stupid  the script is
was there a script  the villain is severely unscary and wears yellow wellington boots  the kids are annoying  the lead man is charisma free  and it has the audacity to go on for   minutes  utterly without merit on any level  this is akin to torture  normally such a statement would be an exaggeration meant for comical effect  not in this case  i ll even say it again   this is torture   at the end i was in a state of paralysis  this was brief thankfully  but once i recovered i decided i had to watch the  making of  featurette  i had to understand  maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  was it all an elaborate joke  i watched the first   minutes of the  making of  featurette and discovered that the writer director was  to put it mildly  somewhat misguided  i also discovered that because i had taken time out to watch the first two minutes of the  making of  featurette of dark harvest   that i was an idiot  not a pleasant voyage of self discovery  life sucks   highly unrecommended
