i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was    whether to show how stupid  disorganized  unprofessional and arrogant the police is  i surely could add various adjectives here  but i think my point on this is clear    whether to show how a twisted minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos    whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers    or was it just to show that any   minutes of filmed material can still be called a movie
  this was one of those movies  that in a way   did not disappoint me  from the first   minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award  and surprisingly enough   this was consistent throughout the whole time  it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end   and i was not disappointed there either    was it a complete waist of time  yes  which raises your question   why did i watch it throughout  well  i was trying to fall asleep  and i thought this was a great candidate for that  but unfortunately i had too much coffee before that
