i have never before voted   for a movie on the imdb  but for this one i am sorry the scale doesn t go down to    all i can say abou this movie is that i saw it in a sneak preview  and it was my worst movie experience ever  i don t mind the stupid jokes  i can live with the silly story  but when i see those dumbly grinning  main characters  with their pseudo foreign speech  only germans will understand what i talk about  i felt i kind of loathing i never thought i was capable of   if they had left them out  the thing may actually have been acceptable   there s not much more to be said about this one  you may laugh once or twice  because it s so ridiculous  but that doesn t make it any better  it is definitely not funny   if you live outside of germany  be happy and rejoice that this awful work will most likely never make it to your cinemas   if you do live in germany  avoid this movie at all costs
