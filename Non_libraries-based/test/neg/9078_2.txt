the evil that men do   was one of the few non cannon films charlie bronson made during the  s  unlike most of the cannon films charlie starred in  this one wasn t fun or entertaining  charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people for over an hour and a half  if you thought he was mr  emotion before  wait until you see this    in this one  charlie goes to an unnamed central american country and shows the populace that whoever messes with chuck or his people have to pay the piper  this one is no fun  it s not cheesy or campy  just brutal  sadistic and not in a good way    i didn t like this one  i have no love for this film  no recommendations because it s not worth watching  maybe if they didn t cut the hell out of it  watch with precaution   don t bother
