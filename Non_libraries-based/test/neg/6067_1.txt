from kreestos    the dialog is terrible  awful  drivel  acting poor  many plot flaws  i don t recommend this at all   from wikipedia   artistic licenses the working manuscript of the score is attributed to two copyists [ ]  both of whom were male  not female as depicted in the film   the copyists neither contributed to nor altered the score  in fact  they were berated by beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score   the movie is set in   during the composition of beethoven s ninth symphony  throughout the movie beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly  in reality  beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier   beethoven never experienced permanent deafness  his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus  the ninth symphony was composed at a time when beethoven s hearing had deteriorated severely  at this point in his life  most of beethoven s conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks  it can be argued  however  that he was also able to read people s lips  evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him   in the film  beethoven makes an allusion to the moonlight sonata  this is an anachronism as the sonata no     quasi una fantasia  was not named  moonlight  until several years after his death
