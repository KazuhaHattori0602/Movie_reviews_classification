 edy  the brother rhett behaves like an escapee from an institution  when josh talks to girl friend emily about his brother  he almost hints at rhett not playing with a full deck  nonetheless josh performs a  wedding  for rhett and a woman rhett met just a few hours before  there were a few interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road  however for me the most telling thing was that people were walking out of the film and i saw it at a free screening
