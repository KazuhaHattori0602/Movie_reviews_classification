if you need a clue as to whether playmaker is decent or not  look to its star  colin firth  who refers to it in an interview as  absolute rubbish   i sincerely hope no one ever sees it   the script and plot are ludicrous  the female lead is unconvincing  the only thing worthwhile is colin firth  and he seems slightly embarrassed throughout   for diehard firth fans only   the shower scene alone is worth the   you might have to shell out  should you find it in a video cutout bin like i did   i m happy for mr  firth that his days of taking projects like this one are over
