i couldn t make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir   the plot was confusing  the acting was alright  but the picture quality was awful  though i bought this at a  gansters double pack    movies on two discs  at walmart for   and when you put the dvd in  it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have   the plot was flip flopping everywhere i couldn t understand it and had no idea what was going on then  the end  popped up and the movie was over    what a waste of my time   i say don t waste your money or time on this  or if you too bought that gansters double pack then just skip over this one
