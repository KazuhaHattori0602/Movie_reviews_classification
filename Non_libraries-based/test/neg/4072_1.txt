this movie is so bad it s worth seeing  this movie will have viewers lapsing in and out of a coma within the first   minutes  it all started when a bunch of writers came up with the idea of a jetliner being hijacked and a passenger who can fly a small plane has to land the beast  however  they know it s been done before many times so to make it different  let s do it very badly  major masters has his name pirated from  s movie  to live and die in l a  from character played by willem dafoe  that saved   minutes in writing and production time  the plane is supposed to be a boieng   that plane has a unique silhouette  even in the dark with its characteristic forward hump on the top  just ask the late ronald reagan who lamented this point when them ruskies shot down kal   in the eighties  yet when the plane takes off it s clearly not a   looks more like a   this well researched film also forgets to include the engineer s seat in the cockpit and replaces it with two comfy rumble seats  no need for a flight engineer on this complex plane  heroine is played by perpetually pouting gloria lynn berg  after tying up the hijacker  despite several bus loads of people on this jumbo jet  nobody bothers to watch this guy who almost killed all of them  he s just forced to amuse himself   the crippled plane  leaking fuel from all the hijacking shenanigans won t make it back to hawaii so masters will try to land at an air force base located on an island  only the runway s   feet too short  four army guys with little bobcats  the kind you rent to take all day moving a load of horse manure to the back of your barn  are gonna clear a   foot wide and   foot long swath through the jungle in   minutes  no need for a bulldozer here  where can you find guys like this  these guys could make a highway between los angeles and las vegas in   hours equipped only with tablespoons  a compass and a duck   after that hellish obstacle is fixed  masters will try to land the plane as heroine pouts away  hijacker giggles to himself and unsupervised gets free to make more trouble  he is finally subdued in a most retarded manner that i can t tell you  but  can you say moby dick   there are so many retarded scenes in this movie  the wounded captain is parked prone on the bar on the plane while masters  who supposedly can barely fly  puts the plane into   degree banks and   feet per minute drops  the pilot should be french kissing the ceiling during these challenging stunts  but doesn t budge an inch    i think that if they had picked different actors to play the parts  this moving could have been way better  if we need a pouting heroine in the movie  why not pick better known actress bernadette peters who seems to be perpetually pouting as well  besides  she can sing and the busty well aging peters could feature some gratuitous cleavage shots  now with the singing angle this could be a hijacking  let s land the plane movie musical  cast luciano pavarotti as the pilot  they can sing a duet in the cockpit prior to the hijacking and there s no way that tubby tenor would fly up to the ceiling as masters works his magic on that big bird  in keeping with the musical theme  masters could then be played by andrei bocelli  that peters can sing with as he lands the plane  not only is he totally blind but only knows a couple of words of english  now that s a plot  think of the edge of your seat conversation between masters  bocelli  and the air traffic controller   atc   sir  please throttle back to   flaps set to   degrees  maintain   heading   bocelli   what   atc   sir  arm spoilers now  confirm brake pressure at   psi  maintain descent at   fpm   bocelli   what   the hijacker could have been played by the late great rodney dangerfield who can spew a plethora of his one liners as he sits tied up and unguarded   i get no respect  my wife is into group sex  yeah  she screwed me in front of the judge and jury  get the idea   missed opportunities the movie has your standard crying and moaning passengers that are never developed  woody allen could have been at the back offering one of his neurotic monologues   she said i was great in bed  i told her i practice myself a lot  now this is a movie   also  according to similar movie  executive decision  where lazy eyed steven segal is mercifully killed at the start giving that movie a chance   s have massive attics up top  the plane was introduced in   so who knows what has accumulated in almost   years up there  my uncle has old clothes  a sled  magazines and all sorts of stuff in his  wouldn t it have been cool if masters opened the trap door and saw a teary eyed chevy chase in a woman s housecoat watching old super   movies of his childhood  just a recommendation   so give it a chance  and as u lapse in and out of consciousness imagine how great this movie could have been if i had my hand in it
