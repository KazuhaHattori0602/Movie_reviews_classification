the   version of  enchanted april  manages to be simultaneously tedious  and perfunctory  it is difficult to show the transformative magic of italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical italian behavior to belabor  the transformation of the four strangers fleeing london is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later  rather than develop  the screenplay flips a switch and the  characters are different   the husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up  even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and or hostilities   jessie ralph has the most fun  moving instead of entirely chewing up the  scenery  and katharine alexander has some poignant charm out of her  husband s shadow  and away from his hideous droning  ann harding is  unremarkable here  with the production code being enforced  she had an  appropriate line in an earlier  pre code  movie   when ladies meet   you re  not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you  but in  enchanted april  can only look hurt  rush out  and proclaim fealty to her errant husband
