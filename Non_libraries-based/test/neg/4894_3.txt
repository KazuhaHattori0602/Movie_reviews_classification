 the ballad of the sad caf  worked hard at its image  but when it came down to crunch time  it was left standing in its own self created dust   one cannot image saying this out loud  but if vanessa redgrave s amelia were to fight john wayne or even clint eastwood  my hard earned dollars would have to go to redgrave  her portrayal of amelia was as close to perfection and consumed with more detailed dedication than most actors are willing to give to any multi million dollar contracted persona  redgrave gave amelia this soulful drawl that was a blend of her own unique voice and a hard earned woman from the south  to the average viewer  this could be construed as annoying  but as the film progressed it became her   miss amelia transforming this stage beauty into a roughneck  it was redgrave s performance  as well as her interaction with the other characters  that made this film stand tall   but not the tallest  the others following her performance were needed  but not stellar  as we moved past the murky clich  image passed on by every set designer hired for the post depression south job  the minor characters felt like poster board  the image was needed to set the scene  but the characters of the town had no other purpose  take for example rod steiger s vision of some old  wild spoken preacher  his scenes alone will make any viewer question the validity of this off the beaten path town  the main two players who surrounded amelia battled with charm for the admirable top scene stealing moment  but due to the lacking direction   it just seemed faded  the most absurd of the two  albeit both rank high among the questionable sanity line  is cork hubbard who plays amelia s  cousin  who shows up randomly one night  his character is never quite defined  he lacks true motive  and his loyalties remain uncertain  he plays no vital role in this film outside of forcing us  the viewers  to question his sanity and honesty  can you create a character simply by sticking out your tongue  flicking your ears  and punching your chest and head  finally  there is the other end of the absurd   keith carradine  callow s close ups of this tormented man build character  but our lack of understanding between him and amelia causes his purpose to flounder  these were the characters  as clich  southern as they were   some stood forward and attempted to create an absurdist period piece  and i cannot argue that they failed   where  ballad of the sad caf  failed to rise above mediocrity was in the cinematography and narrative  this film was about amelia  and her need for other souls in her life  the audience s level of comfort with the arrival of her midget cousin was entertaining   one couldn t help but wonder if he was honest or merely a confidence man attempt to leech off a warm heart  cork hubbard s character is never quite understood  but we do accept him with brief shots of him and amelia doing small things together  it is his idea that transforms from a recluse businesswoman to a bona fide caf  owner  the problem is that director callow never quite takes us to that dramatic take level between cork and redgrave   is the man crazy or does he represent all of amelia s family  i needed something from callow that brought these two out of the david lynch esquire relationship that they had  then our pool gets even deeper with the addition of carradine as amelia s  love interest  using the technique of a flashback within a flashback  we see the two wed  but never consummate their love   which amelia s anger against their love drawing him into the world of madness  why was amelia so angry  why was there no connection between carradine and redgrave  why was this even in the film  with the lack of focus towards these characters s connection  the eventual scenes between the two made no sense   throw in cork s choice and it just gets completely discombobulated  while there were a few beautiful choreographed scenes that callow created  the inability to transfer his characters from point a to point b  i lost focus  interest  and my care for the characters plummeted when i didn t understand the ultimate question    why    overall   the ballad of the sad caf  began with a bang  but ended with a very small crack of a firecracker  my emotional feel of this film swung up and down  up and down  and eventually stayed further down mainly due to the lack of understanding of the motives of the characters  redgrave did a phenomenal job as amelia  and while the other characters  outside of the random steiger  tried their best  i just didn t quite understand who they were  their motives were so muddled that when the emotional ending finally occurred  i was apathetic  director callow seemed to have been lacking importing connecting scenes that would allow us to understand the dynamic relationship between all of our main players  callow created some beautiful scenes where faces seemed to overlap the scenery  which allowed us to focus on amelia   or carradine  but nothing was explained or developed  the film played out with anger  discover  happiness  flashback  anger  anger  anger  fade out  without the comparative connectors  this transformed from distinguished period film to actors playing parts in front of camera  it was a shame  because  sad caf  had the promise  it just couldn t deliver   grade      out of
