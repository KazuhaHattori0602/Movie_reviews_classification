i will keep it to bullet points so here goes    very badly scripted    tries to be like resident evil    zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging lunatics    never saw blood clean up so easily    special effects not as good as the original  day of the living dead    acting not as good as the  bold and the beautiful    it looks like it was written in   week and made the next week   basicaly med team plus special forces go into a zombie infested university to find the first zombie and extract a serum to cure the plague  all die except the   main stars so predictable even though unarmed and swarmed with  s of zombies they survived  however special forces  who were trained at kindergarten school scouts  only took   zombie to kill them even though they had weapons  also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps  overall load of rubbish
