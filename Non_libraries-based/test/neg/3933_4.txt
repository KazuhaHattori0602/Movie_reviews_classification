the plot in petites coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded    spoiler   in the space of  hrs or so  auteuil s character has an affair with a teenager  loses his wife s affections  attempts to seduce scott thomas  is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble    end of spoiler   wha    the only saving grace in this flick is kristin scott thomas  similar to charlotte rampling  she seems a  natural  to star in french cinema  my hope is that one day fran ois ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent   there are some fine french films such as the remarkable le colonel chabert begging for a dvd release  yet this is the tripe that gets chosen   avoid this one   zzzz
