  bad acting     for a bunch of castaways on an alien planet  it sure looked like home  especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background     terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left  right and center     cool  s scifi jumpsuits  possibly the only good thing about this movie     interesting ship at the beginning  this crew must have been watching space   a lot  too bad it blows up so early  the escape ship also got sunk too fast   sigh     anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior
