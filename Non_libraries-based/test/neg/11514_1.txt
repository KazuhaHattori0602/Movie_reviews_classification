this movie is about   stories put together revolving around   separate individuals  one of the worst movie that is available and even better if it is not available   the good     pretty lesbians actress   true and touching story about theresa chan  the bad  the main story that revolves around the blind and dear woman theresa chan does not need to be told in a movie format and more appropriate in a documentary format  no linkage between the   story lines  minimum dialogue in the film  substituted by smss and chat programs on pc  no cultural insight by the movie and it makes you forget even before you step out of the cinema
