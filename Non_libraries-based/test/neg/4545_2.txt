as to be expected  there s a pretty good reason why this film is so obscure and unknown in spite of dealing with the always popular premise of zombies and starring the  s b movie queen linda blair  namely  it sucks   the chilling  is trying enormously hard   way too hard   to be a story with depth and factual background  whereas it should have just been a light headed and gore packed horror flick about frozen zombies  it takes an incredibly long time before anything remotely interesting or significant happens  there s a lot of drivel about cryogenics  which i learned in my physics class is the study of products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures  so naturally  in this film a bunch of people are studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen  needless to say this is extremely boring  until two dim witted night watchmen decide  during an electric power failure  that it s a good idea to put the metal constructed cool cells outside at the heights of a thunderstorm  the coolers are struck by lightening  obviously  and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a murderous zombie rampage   the chilling  is a boring and surprisingly  for a late  s effort  at least  gore free horror film that doesn t even use up a quarter of its potential  all the painful attempts to build up an atmosphere of suspense and eeriness fail tremendously and i can t think of any reason why the zombie attacks had to be so bloodless  even in spite of the low budget available  they could have done better  the set pieces  make up effects and costumes are pitiable  the research lab  for example  looks like a proper apartment flat whilst the zombies couldn t look less menacing with their green faces and foil wrapped outfits  how linda blair managed to get involved yet again in such an embarrassing low budgeted horror flick is a complete mystery  she s attracted to lousy b movies like bees are to honey
