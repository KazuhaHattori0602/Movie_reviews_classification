this is the most stupid movie ever made  the story is laughable  his wife and kid think he s insane  then they don t  then it turns out he is and i think they knew it all along  there is a dog named ned that causes some problems and i think it s all his fault so does jim carey  god only knows why virginia madsen took this role this is a career sinker  i think the target audience for this is   and   year olds  and that adds up to   or maybe it s for   and   years olds which also adds up to   or maybe it s for really dumb   year olds  or maybe really dumb   year olds because that s   in reverse  or maybe   year olds would enjoy it because half of that is   i think looking up things on the internet about the number   would be more entertaining than this movie  unless you wanted to see a comedy
