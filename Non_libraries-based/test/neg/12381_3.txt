this one s as cheesy as they come   the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too loopy for words  but wait till you get a load of the goofy creature as it appears on screen  i tell you i laughed so hard through this thing that i missed out on some of the expository dialogue   then again  the latter is often so heavy on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such  at which i ve never been any good  in spite of my love of sci fi movies  that it didn t really matter anyway  the bird   first depicted as a mere blurred form whizzing through the skies but subsequently shown in all its dopey glory   is so sublimely silly that it wouldn t be amiss in a looney tunes cartoon  witness the series of intermittently taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end on a side splitting extreme close up of its face    director sears had fared much better with his other film about ufos  the fine earth vs  the flying saucers     with special effects provided by a master  ray harryhausen  speaking of which  i ve just given away my copy of the latter in anticipation of acquiring columbia s recently released se dvd  also  it seems to me that some of the footage illustrating the bird s rampage in new york here were lifted from the destruction of washington seen in that earlier sci fi classic  again  the leads are played by genre regulars   namely jeff morrow  from this island earth [ ]  and mara corday  from tarantula [ ]  as with the afore mentioned flying saucers  these titles are highly regarded and beloved by fans   consequently  they are vastly superior to this lamentable addition to the alien monster animal cycle prevalent during the sci fi heyday and beyond  incidentally  other flying menaces were featured in the flying serpent [ ]  which i haven t watched  and larry cohen s tongue in cheek updating of same in q  the winged serpent [ ]   unfortunately  the giant claw can t even rise to a decent climax   which is so rushed as to be  a wash out  to quote a jet pilot from the film itself whose assault with rockets on the bird proves completely ineffective  that is  before morrow realizes that it s shielded by an invisible barrier and then has to figure out a way how to be able to penetrate it  ultimately  apart from the intractable  and frankly tedious  technical asides  one gets a feeling of  so bad  it s good  watching this  after all  it only lasts for   minutes   and  in any case  the bird is such an unforgettably daft creation as to put a huge smile on your face every time it turns up
