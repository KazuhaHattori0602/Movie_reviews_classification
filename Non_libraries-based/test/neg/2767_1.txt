this movie really sucks   just try to stay awake for   minutes while watching this baloney about a nice girl  joan woodbury  who gets involved with the  underworld  because she needs money  and because she s too lazy to take a job from friends after they offer it to her  alan ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing  but he s nowhere to be found for the first freaking half hour and when he does show up  he stands around like a constipated mannequin  a real dud with enough talky scenes and unlikeable  as well as stupid  characters to make you wish somebody would shoot anybody  like really fast   bring a pillow
