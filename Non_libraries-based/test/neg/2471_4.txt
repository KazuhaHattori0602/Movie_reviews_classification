for what it s worth  this is a fairly decent road runner cartoon  if a little short  just under   minutes  the gags are adequate at best  the animation is competent  and the new restored dvd master looks nice  however  that s where the qualities end  allow me to provide a little backstory  in   thanks to a labour dispute  wb got hold of a bunch of canned music that would be used in   of the year s cartoons   there is only one phrase to describe this short s music  and that is  it has the  kids sound  i use that phrase to describe music which has absolutely no correspondence to the on screen action  and feels like it was recorded by an orchestra consisting of members of a sonic youth cover band  the music in this short feels hopelessly tacked on and incredibly obnoxious  especially considering there are scenes in this short  namely the piano trap  that would have worked best with little or no music   i didn t think a wb cartoon would be ruined by awful music  even lava s scores aren t this obnoxious  but considering the cartoon isn t that notable anyway  it becomes almost painful to watch with the music  it s kind of like how late  s episodes of doctor who could be bad anyway  and yet be made unwatchable thanks to keff mcculloch s unbelievably awful music  which sounded like he hit the demo button on all   of his casio keyboards at the same time   i am going to have people call me crazy for this  but i d easily watch one of larriva s rr cartoons over this  at least the canned music was usually in sync with the action on those
