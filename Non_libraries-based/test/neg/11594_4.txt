this is like a zoology textbook  given that its depiction of animals is so accurate  however  here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film     handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons  it doesn t matter how many times you shoot at the komodo  bullets just won t go near it     the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra  or a giant komodo dragon  is just to stand there  the exception to this rule is if you ve been told to stay very still  in which case you should run off  until the komodo is right next to you  and then you should stand there  expecting defeat     minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching       is a memory enhancement tool  and an ample substitute for losing your boating license getting arrested     members of elite army units don t see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over sized beings  maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it     when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing  a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need  sound gear  a second camera  microphones etc are all superfluous     when you hear a loud animal scream  and one person has a gun  he should take it out and point it at the nearest person     when you take a gun out  the sound of the safety being taken off will be made  even if your finger is nowhere near the safety    reporters agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something   without having the faintest idea what they re exposing  background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism     handguns hold at least   bullets in one clip  and then more than that in the next clip  despite that  those with guns claim that they will need more ammo     expensive cameras  also  remember that the reporter only has one camera  are regularly left behind without even a moment s hesitation or regret  these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves     the blonde girl really is the stupid one     the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it  thus making it unsafe  takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection   and nobody says a word about it     high tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets     genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to   feet long in a matter of a day  but don t grow at all in the weeks either side     the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don t meet contact deadlines     men with guns don t necessarily change the direction they re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them  instead  they just keep shooting into the air     the better looking you are  the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures     women s intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds     any time you re being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age     animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for  swearing  at the same volume     old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military
