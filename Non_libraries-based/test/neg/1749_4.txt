i liked most of this film  as other reviews mentioned it has a good cast  the plot is interesting enough  all in all it is fun to watch   but the ending  i feel  is completely botched  it left me bewildered  yes  you expect people crossing and double crossing each other in this sort of movie  but quadruple crossing  well  if it s justified by the plot then why not    but that s the bad part  there s completely no need for it  after a certain point it s all scheming with completely no meaning   here comes the spoiler  after the airport scene enrico and his accomplices already have the money  i couldn t understand the need for the rest of the scam  is it all necessary just to rub federico s nose in the fact that he s been fooled  i don t buy it   so   out of   for   of the film and   out of   for the ending
