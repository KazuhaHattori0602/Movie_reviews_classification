this is possibility the worst and most disappointing film i have ever seen  i ve spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film to be made about the experience  this isn t it  the  acting  is god awful and the plot non existent   here are a few incidents from my one year in halls of residence     a posh lad that unknowingly got off with a transvestite    the best friend pairing of two girls   one with huge breasts and the other with the nickname  the brick    a couple that shag too loudly    the lad who gets all the girls   the lad from northern ireland who is very difficult to understand    mcdonalds in bed   curry every night for a week   student bashing  couple of my mates ended up in hospital   the discarded joint that started a fire    the flood   the lad who wakes up on his floor to find that every item of furniture has be taken from his room   and if i can come up with that list in   minutes and from real life  i m sure a couple of script writers can do better  a lot better   and for a film named after a sleeper song  where is the britpop soundtrack
