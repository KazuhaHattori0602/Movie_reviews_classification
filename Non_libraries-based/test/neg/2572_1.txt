this film is without a doubt the worst action film i have ever seen  i am sorry  but it is just pathetic  in fact  the best part of the movie  this movie is supposed to be a serious one  is when a chicken speeds across the road  on foot  at about   miles per hour  this pathetic editing mistake makes the film absolutely hilarious for approximately   seconds  then it is back to  non stop  on the edge of your seat  as you try to find a comfortable position to sleep in  action
