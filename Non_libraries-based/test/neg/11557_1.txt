i think i can safely say  without really giving anything away  that this movie had no robots in it  the guys in  robot  costumes didn t act or speak as such  and the evil entity behind the whole  plot  isn t a robot either   the whole thing looks like it was shot in a city park somewhere  with photos dropped in the background when the director needed a custom set  i can t even use words to describe the acting   this couldn t even offer the hilarious ending of  star crystal  in short  it is clearly one of the worst sci fi movies of the  s and i would be so bold as to say  of all time
