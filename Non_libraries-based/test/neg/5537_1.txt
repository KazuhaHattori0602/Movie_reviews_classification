how in the name of decency did this film ever get made    one presumes the subtitles merely say  awful  on every single frame of this truly dismal effort   horrendous acting  woeful dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating   minutes   overall impression    a bunch of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made   this makes hammer horror tv shows look like oscar material   and don t for a second think this falls into the  so bad it s good  category  it s not even that bad   but the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look
