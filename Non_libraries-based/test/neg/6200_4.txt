i was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a  laugh riot  but the movie turned out be disappointing   you will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can t ignore the flaws and the shortcomings     the missile scene was total stupidity     katrina kaif and govinda pair looked awful   he s   and she s just   more than double of her age    salman s comedy is less of acting and more of overacting     songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie     some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny  and   poor and flawed story   however  there are few pluses    govinda  great individual performance     some scenes are actually quite funny     kattrina kaif  looks and acting keeps on improving with every film     rajpal yadav s don sequences  though under utilized but hilarious   so   good points    bad ones  this one gets
