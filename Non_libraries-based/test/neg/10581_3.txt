here s a spoof that s guaranteed to entertain folks in the iq range of homer simpson  it s a cheap shot at every great superhero  notably spiderman and batman  but it doesn t end there  it gets progressively worse until it disintegrates into a pathetic ensemble of slapstick trollop by the truckload   for those interested in the plot  you ve only to watch spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotic  what you get is dragonfly man   a boy wonder  who loves the girl next door  suddenly inheriting some stupendous super powers   the rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth  but don t  take my word for it  for kids  this is somewhat amusing  for adults it s a great film to drop the kids off for
