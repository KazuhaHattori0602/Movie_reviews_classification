   spoiler alert   if you happen to like jurassic park     or    if you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality  case in point john carpenter s dark star highly recommended   if you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general   then stay away from this cinematic crapsterpiece   the shameless use of stock footage from carnosaur       make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino slasher flick  take the scene  for instance  where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the alpha t rex  for some reason  he drops about   pounds and appears   years younger  why is that  simply because this scene was lifted directly from carnosaur  which was a crummy flick to begin with   the ending was a carbon copy of carnosaur   for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight to video loser  again  we see mr  rex do battle against a bulldozer which alternates as a forklift truck through the miracle of  ta daa  stock footage from the aforementioned carnosaur       of course  the ending is exactly the same the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames   a real insult to anyone s intelligence   but it s still better than watching the rosie o  donnel show   rating    out of
