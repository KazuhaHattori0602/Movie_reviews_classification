family guy is easily one of the worst shows i ve ever forced myself to watch  not at the bottom  though   i ve seen the jersey shore  a popular hit with high school and college kids who mistake immaturity for edginess  this show is unoriginal and stale   as this has been dubbed a comedy show  let s take a look at its  humor    random flashbacks cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or anything that can be cut to for a knee jerk laugh  it got old after the   or so repetitions per episode  simple solution  every time you hear  this is worse than like the time  plug your ears     inappropriateness for its own sake  this show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot  solution  watch south park  they did it right   the bottom line is that family guy is not worth your time  and doesn t hold a candle to the simpsons
