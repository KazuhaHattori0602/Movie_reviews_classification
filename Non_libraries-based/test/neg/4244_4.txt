throughout the  s and into the  s   s and even into the  s  a slew of war films were produced in the former yugoslavia  glorifying the heroism of the  partisans    civilians who turned out to fight a guerrilla war against the invading german forces  hajrudin krvavac  who s generally only known in eastern europe  directed quite a few of these  partisan  stories  unfortunately  only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the europe and the united states   battle of the eagles  is a rare  low budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force   marshal tito decrees that a partisan air force must be formed to combat the german luftwaffe in the skies over yugoslavia  a group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys  over the course of several months  more pilots and planes join the ranks  eventually forming a formidable air force  maybe it s history  or maybe it s fable   whatever it is  it sure isn t convincing  but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work   the film opens strongly with a well shot german air raid on defenseless partisans  the nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately  and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes  then the action starts  and this title quickly becomes yet another low budget  by the numbers adventure  all of the characters are familiar clich s  major dragan  played by a well meaning bekim fehmiu  is our typical patriotic  heroic leading man  he blasts away at strafing planes with a machine gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous klauberg  radko polic  a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome  the rest of the partisans are familiar  ljubisa samardzic  the battle of neretva  is a zare  a hotshot playboy  bata zivojinovic  hell river  is voss  a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him  and rados bajic  the day that shook the world  is dalibor  a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks  eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot  the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan  and krvavac doesn t try to build upon these stereotypes  the cast does a fair job  and despite the two dimensional script  every player is engaging and fun to watch  bajic  in particular  has some great moments   when he s going to take his first flight as a gunner  and later  when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed  the plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the germans  and subsequent retaliatory acts   krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects  unfortunately  the miniatures are so cheap and false looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable  some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real  while dogfights involving scale models  complete with action figure pilots  are just plain pathetic  sometimes smoke puffs from the  machine guns  are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane  worse  the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage  although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective  they re surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism  all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by bojan adamic    battle of the eagles  also suffers from a very poorly edited english language release  to begin with    minutes of footage is missing   cutting the film from   minutes to a mere   the missing segments were carelessly excised  and the cutting looks very sloppy  music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved  in the last third of the film  the story falls apart  and only some badly needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility  then  there s the dubbing
 all of the scenes revolving around the partisans are dubbed in english  rather poorly  however  yet several lengthy scenes remain in german  without the benefit of subtitles  the film might have made much more sense had the german language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the partisans   on the plus side  krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well  there is never a moment where the audience feels like they re on a soundstage  in particular  the german luftwaffe bases are expansive  complete with dozens of messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets  the scenery is fresh and green  and krvavac isn t afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek  a german ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out  as does a sequence where zare and dalibor escape from an enemy base   as it exists on home video   battle of the eagles  is just another of many stories about the yugoslav partisan movement  there is nothing to set it apart from the rest of the crop  and the terrible special effects and drastic editing put it a notch below acceptable  try to avoid this one unless you can find a full length copy
