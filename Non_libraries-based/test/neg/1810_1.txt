taylor deemer mrs  drake english   pib b    march     a shot in the dark  it is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly unexciting  the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with  so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally off handed idea anyways  basically guaranteeing a fail    most of the book is of the mental travel of a young seaman named marlow on a job through the many darknesses of the congo and people as a whole
i feel like the screenwriter failed massively at capturing the essence of marlow s travels  it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark  that is the major point in the book and when that doesn t translate to the movie  all that s left is   minutes of boredom and monotony    this being the case  the question is posed  why would anyone make this into a movie  an even better question could then be asked  who would want to watch it  it is utterly a chore to watch  had it not contributed to a grade in my english class  i would have never even considered watching the movie  i would never recommend this movie to anyone  heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when it s taken from the pages of the book  the novella is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so  but the afterthought is that it is a pretty decent book  the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target    how can a book that s all about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical  visual sense  i feel like it s impossible to accurately show thoughts  also  i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that don t seem to add up at all  the novella heart of darkness was published in   while the movie version of heart of darkness is from   the   years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different terrains  the novella seems to have much harsher conditions  and the movie does not portray the prehistoric feel of the congo  the congo  in the movie  just seems like another place  not the dark  inhuman place that the book paints this setting of  i feel like this removes another major element that really contributes to the novella   with two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie  the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone  when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme  not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly pointless and it is  it s dull  unexciting  and a major waste of time  there s no reason to watch it  the book is stripped of any significance it has  if it s necessary  for some reason  read the book  avoid the movie at all costs    cast and credits marlow  tim roth kurtz  john malkovich the russian morten faldaas the intended  phoebe nicholls  directed by  nicolas roeg written by benedict fitzgerald  based on the novella by joseph conrad running time    minutes rated pg    some sexuality and language
