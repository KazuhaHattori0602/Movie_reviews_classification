ok i ve seen over   troma films  and some of them are pretty bad   sizzle beach u s a  was horrible  and  i was a teenage tv terrorist  was unwatchable  but this is the worst film in the troma library   a bunch of women are kept in a prison and tortured as they try to escape   this is really terrible  even as exploitation films go  doris wishman and hershall gordon lewis would probably kill the director if they saw this poor excuse for an cult film  avoid this movie at all costs
