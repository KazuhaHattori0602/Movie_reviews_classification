i really seldom give either one or ten stars to any movie  but this was so awful  i had to make an exception   i am a scifi fan and have seen a few comedic takes on scifi that i genuinely like  there just wasn t anything here to like   i realize this was started with an extremely small budget by a film student  but even considering that  the sets and effect are bad  the cinematography is mediocre  but may be the best part of the movie   the acting is bad  a sad state when the female voice over for the computer is the best actor  the dialogue is bad  the script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent   the humor is not just subtle and sublime  it s nowhere to be found  as an example  a whole   minutes  of the   minute film  is spent on a lame   punch combo joke with the alien mascot and the elevator   this was supposed to be a parody of everything from bad  s scifi to   what we end up with though  is just a slightly updated version of an old  s scifi c movie  at least those movies were funny because they took themselves seriously
