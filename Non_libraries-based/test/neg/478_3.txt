i m   bruce was the man in evil dead  and i still love to watch ed  and ed  it was cool also to see him as the king two or three years ago in bubba ho tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent  but this screaming brain adventure is certainly not for bruce s early fans  either i m getting too old for this sh  or i m just not part of bruce s target audience anymore  i m positive kids age   to   will love this film  but this over extended matin e sci fi comedy contains about   minutes total of interesting moments  and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor  campbell better talk seriously with sam raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last evil dead reunion picture to get back my interest  at least there would be a good director behind the camera  sorry bruce  this just doesn t cut it for me  take care
