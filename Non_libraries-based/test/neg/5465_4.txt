book of revelations starts very well  daniel  an egomaniac dancer is kidnapped  abused and sexually raped by three masked women   after that  nothing else really happens  there is some hint of rediscovery but the movie gives nor explanation nor a real ending  daniel reactions after the abuse are very basic  he quits dancing  has sex with every women around and finally starting a relation with very simple and common woman   i have seen a good share of art house movies but this has something missing in it   the main leads are fine  but some characters does not seems to be completely defined
