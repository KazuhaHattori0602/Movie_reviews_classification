this movie was nothing like the book    everything was mixed up or changed  most of the movie was things that weren t even in the book   this movie never should have been viewed  it was a great disappointment to me when i enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing   i would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of nora roberts or j d  robb   honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is
