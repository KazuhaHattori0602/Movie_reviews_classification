this movie has every clich  of every terrorism or airliner crisis movie   however  it is not entirely unwatchable  thanks to good performances by rowland  loken and smallwood  and maybe enberg   what is amazingly bad  though  is the computer animations they try to pass off as live action scenes  boy  oh boy  the cgi scenes in  the last starfighter  filmed in   are better than these  filmed   years later  the feeling of cheepnis really sends shivers down your spine   a pity  this could have been a much better movie with a little more budget and taste
