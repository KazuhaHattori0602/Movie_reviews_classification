i watched this movie with big expectations  the blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one  but it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying  the violence was nothing i haven t seen a thousand times before  the gore level was only average  mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in hollywood in the last   years   perhaps more  and at no stage was i even feeling uneasy let along frightened  again a cat   movie with big wraps  has not lived up to its hype   sure hire this movie  but don t go in with any expectations  i am so keen to get into the whole asian horror scene  but am continuously disappointed  i did love ichi  and audition  but then again  miike stands alone at the moment   please inspire me  there is a large cluster of jaded genre fans who are starved of quality horror
