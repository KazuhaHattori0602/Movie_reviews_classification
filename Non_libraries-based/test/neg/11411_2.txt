wow  i just saw demon wind a little while ago  and i don t think i ll ever be the same  it has the power to inspire nightmares  but for all the wrong reasons  actually   never before has humanity seen such a gratuitous change in make up  for no damn reason  or  similarly  so much bad zombie   makeup that makes you hungry for those halloween green marshmallows   or so much naked old lady  for that matter  but then  there was  the shining   the plot here is so amateurish that it actually almost holds a little bit of charm  as does the dialog  the last shot of the film is just so silly that its beyond description  it s like some drunk college student got together with some pals and decided to throw bruce willis type dialog together with  i guess  teenybopper dialog from some elm street film  the result is jarring  and it d be truly funny if it was intended that way   ah  what the hey  i ll laugh anyway   hell  get together with your friends and watch this  but make absolutely sure you re drunk first  or  you may go insane  particularly if you re a college film student   cheers
