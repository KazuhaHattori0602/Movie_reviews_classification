i like the most of the full moon pictures so i ordered this movie from the usa  because in germany you can t get it anywhere  i thought it would be so nice and amusing like the subspecies or puppetmaster series  because they were full of atmosphere   i was glad when the movie finally arrived   but after watching this cheesy movie  i was very disappointed  the actors   i think you can t even say actors  are boring and untalented  the story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy   i hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie
