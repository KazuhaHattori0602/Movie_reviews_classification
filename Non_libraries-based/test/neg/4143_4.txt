i wanted to dog this movie  but somehow i can t find it in myself to do that   exhibiting a duality of fighting styles  it s li vs  li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy   this is one of those movies where the story carries the performances  li s acting is extremely amateurish  hesitant  and stiff for most of this movie right up to the very end  at first i tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters  you know  to show a difference in personalities  but it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent  it did get a bit better  more relaxed  toward the end  but that wasn t enough to save his performance  jet li s acting does improve as his career moves forward  i don t hate his acting  i just hated him in this   i also have to say that the effects were very  b  class effects  what effects there are   the story itself had great potential  it was uniquely creative  daring  and fresh  unfortunately  either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting  effects  film quality  and some acting lessons  or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details  he also did not bother with the science in the science fiction  a fact which was a great detractor to this film   the fight sequences were a bit one sided  as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other  but all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt   as enjoyable as this was  i couldn t help but think  all the way through  that this was just one of those movies that you can t help but watch it for what it should ve been  rather than what it is   it rates a   on the  b  scale   that s a    on the  a  scale  for having a good plot  from   the fiend
