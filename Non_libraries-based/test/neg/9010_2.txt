i accept that most  s horror aren t scary by today s standards  but what the hell is this  when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast  instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth yeah which is what the people wanted   the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast but the title really kills the movie  night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn t any blood to speak of   i like how the  s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one  this movie isn t the worst i ve ever seen but its almost up there     out of
