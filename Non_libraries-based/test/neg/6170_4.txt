mickey rourke hunts diane lane in elmore leonard s killshot it is not like mickey rourke ever really disappeared  he has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene  he was memorable in  domino  sin city  man on fire  once upon a time in mexico  and get carter  but in his powerful dramatic performance in the wrestler   we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in get carter  whenever we get to know him  rourke remains a cool  but sleazy  muscle bound slim ball   this is an elmore leonard story  and production  leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller   to yuma  be cool  jackie brown  get shorty    pick up  and joe kidd  this means that we get tough guys  some good  some not so good   it also means we get tight  realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation  weaving complications into violent conclusions  killshot is no different  tough  slim ball killer rourke stalks unhappily married witness lane  think history of violence meets no country for old men  it is not as intense  bloody or gory as those two  but it is almost as good  if you like those two  including david croneberg s equally wonderful eastern promises  you will like killshot also   director john madden has not done a lot of movies  his last few were enjoyable  if not successful  proof  captain corelli s mandolin and shakespeare in love   diana lane hasn t had a powerful movie role since she and richard gere gave incredible performances in unfaithful  lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as nights in rodanthe  must love dogs  and under the tuscan sun  here she is right on mark  balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension   this is a small part for rosario dawson  yet dawson does a good job with it  you see a lot more of lane  including an underwear scene to rival sigourney weaver in aliens and nicole kidman in eyes wide shut   while you are in the crime drama section  also pick up kiss  kiss  bang  bang  and gone baby gone  and before the devil knows your dead  the last has wonderful performances by phillip seymour hoffman  ethan hawke  marisa tomei and albert finney   killshot flopped at the box office  more is our luck  it is certainly worth a   dollar rental  if you like this genre
