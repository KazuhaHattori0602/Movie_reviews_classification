i generally won t review movies i haven t seen in awhile  so i ll pop them in or rent them to give a full and fresh take on the film  in the case of  a sound of thunder  i remembered my vow of never seeing this movie ever again  so i ll just go on memory  in fact  i haven t thought of how badly made this movie was until i read someone else s review and remembered the experience i had back in   when i actually saw this in the theater  my movie buddy forced me to see it  though i wasn t interested  and wow   later on  i forced him to see  basic instinct   in the theater  reminding him he made me see this crap  so  i guess that made us even  i certainly had my share of deep laughs  at the movie s expense  of course  which didn t make him happy as he really wanted to see it  the time travel butterfly effect film had so many bad graphics  the loudest chuckles from me was whenever they showed the dinosaur  god  i loved seeing that dino and them actually being scared of it   it was hilarious  or just simply  ben kingsley  it s great  kingsley can remind us on how human actors can be  going from  gandhi  and  schindler s list  to  uh  this   even a meryl streep can do a  she devil  from time to time  so they re forgiven  for months  i pulled an mst k with my buddy  consistently referencing this movie to any low rent sci fi film or kingsley flick  yes  the movie would be a great movie to see drunk  or otherwise inebriated  horrible over the top acting   special  fx that even the nintendo  would turn away and ridiculous plot twists  the biggest disappointment was that the razzies didn t even nominate this film for any award
