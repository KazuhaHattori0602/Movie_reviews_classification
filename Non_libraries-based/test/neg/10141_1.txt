this really is an  okay  series  everyone in it is pretty good  but i just can t take reba  she s trying to be funny but she just isn t and then she got a stupid accent  if they took her out of the show i would love to see it every day   i have been watching the show in   min now and as i said before  reba is destroying the show  however the   year old guy  dont know his name  but he s soooo funny  and he s really saving it all   so here s the recipe to get a great show  kick reba of it and then put the   year old guy into the lead role   i really hope someone out there agrees with me and thinks  like me  that they should kick reba of the show and put someone else in the lead role
