this very finely crafted film commits the unforgivable  which is ironic  given the film s theme  no one coming into this film knows what they are in for  worse than that    of the way into the film  no one still has any clue of what they re in for because everything up to that  moment  is a different movie   as a front row fan of dutcher s first two films  easily competing for the best   mormon films to date  competing with saints and soldiers and  now  new york doll saw that at a screening  dutcher had me wanting to see his film for a very long time  i was there  i wanted to believe  believe that i d see the next great mormon movie  one that would hold the numero uno spot for a very long time  but no  three fourths in the film took the sharpest of left turns and dragged me through something that i never wanted to go through  he takes on the mt  everest of all moral issues  yea  both of them  with little time or emotional capacity left to adequately address them  but instead waves them both off with a nod towards jesus as if that will make all things well  instantly   true it is that jesus saves  don t accuse me of not believing that  that s not dutcher s problem   is the film shot well  indeed  do the actors act  they acted their pants off  was the music appropriate  all but whatever was over the closing credits  everything about this film was superb  except the story  which was so dank and wrong  that all else doesn t matter   i learned  dank  from new york doll  very decent show  by the way  the third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant nor faith affirming  i know dutcher was bending over backwards to make it so  but i was so far shoved out of the movie at that point that nothing  no thing  could have brought me back  the preposterous unbelievability of dozens of details in the final minutes didn t help  anyone who s been on a mission knows what i m talking about  especially anyone who spoiler alert is familiar with events surrounding someone being sent home from a mission early for moral and or psychological reasons  it s as if a parallel universe suddenly sprung up where normal rules or behaviors suddenly don t apply   there are a million things good about this film  but they were created and beautified only to be trampled upon and thrown away in a knee jerk fit of  ooh  this will really get them  elitism  hence  unforgivable  i can only hope that when dutcher puts the finishing touches on his next film  falling  apparently  that he remembers that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that it s the fans that pay the bills  that s why the first god s army was such an unqualified success   dutcher s shock and awe approach proves that when it comes to the big issues he is in way over his head  having neither the spiritual nor creative maturity nor business sense necessary to take them on  i pray pray he learns his lesson and that years from now he and we all look back  with a chagrin  and rejoice that he pulled his head out of where the light doesn t shine and really  successfully  takes on those and other issues and changes the world forever because of it
