i should have realized that any two video set being sold for only   would be bad  i even read the reviews before watching this film  and that still didn t sway me  i loved the book  and i knew it couldn t be as bad as people said   yeah  it is   a patchwork of film  video  and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three hour tour of one chapter of james a  michener s epic novel  well  the time period covered was one chapter  but i don t remember many of the situations actually occurring in the book  the packaging on my copy of the movie gives maria conchita alonso top billing   though it turns out that she is only in one speaking scene  on the second tape   the actors are to be commended for playing their roles well  despite a smarmy  overwrought script  they are to be insulted  though  for accepting the roles in the first place
