i happened to rent this movie with my sister in hopes of watching a great entertaining movie  that was humorous  however my expectations were let down  this movie was beyond disgusting and revolting for a pg  movie  this should have been rated r for the many mature references that went on in this movie  i wouldn t recommend allowing a   year old teen see this   even if no one under the age of   is watching this movie  beware of a truly stupid movie  there s no humor in the movie  just a bunch of disgusting sexual references including a small touch of pedophilia  something that shouldn t even be joked about    i would like to know what happened to pg  movies  that were actually safe for actual a   year old  this is beyond a deplorable movie and should be re rated
