american graffiti is one of the best movies ever made  i ve seen it at least   times and am emotionally affected by it each time i see it   i graduated from high school in     however  more american graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made   it is hard to believe than anyone associated with the great original movie was involved with this terrible sequel  the part of the movie set in vietnam was extremely inaccurate   i served   months in vietnam with the  st airborne division    the whole movie had nothing worthwhile in any part of it   if anyone ever wants to make a case against making sequels to great movies  more american graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong
