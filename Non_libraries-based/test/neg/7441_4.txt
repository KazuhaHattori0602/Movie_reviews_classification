following which  the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head  rather apt  considering the sorry state of this movie  a sequel to a film which patently didn t need one   what really irritates about robocop   is that the makers obviously didn t understand why the original was so good in the first place  robocop   was a witty  vibrant satire of bad action movies  robocop   is just a bad action movie   thin on dialogue  particularly towards the tedious  shoot out finale  it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original  the spoof ads  now a little tasteless  warning  continued use will cause skin cancer  seem merely there as an afterthought  and calling a new designer drug  nuke  is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the original s family board game   nuke  em   the stop motion animation   the weakest element of the original   is used more extensively  while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence  which makes it look even more cheap and hurried  ah  humourless  you might say  but what about the funny mayor  or the way robo is reprogrammed to spout platitudes  yes  these are attempts at light relief  as is robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver  we re only human  for the film s punchline  but none are likely to induce laughter  like the rest of the film  they re staid and moronic attempts at entertainment   the third and final film in the series  imaginatively titled robocop     saw peter weller leave  to be replaced by robert john burke  who does well in a undemanding role  with toned down language and violence  it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market  a robo action figure much plugged throughout  with it s social conscience too overstated  and robocop s new found arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly  the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece  yet fluid direction by fred dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewing   robocop  then  is the film proper  robocop   is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on  which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle  an unwatchable dirge of a picture  a franchise vehicle that has nothing to say  save for the pound signs that rung up  irvin kershner is no paul verhoven  just as comic artist frank miller and partner walon green aren t the writers that edward neumeier and michael miner were  a tragic waste of a good  if limited  concept
