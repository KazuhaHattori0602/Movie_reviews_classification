the seven collaborations between director joseph  von  sternberg and star marlene dietrich were so distinct in look and tone  and so different from anything else going on at the time  they almost seem to constitute a sub genre of their own  like any genre  they have their outright masterpieces  as well as their absolute turkeys  time to send blonde venus back to the farm   after the seedily seductive hits the blue angel  morocco and shanghai express  in which miss dietrich established her screen image as cabaret singer cum prostitute  someone at paramount decided it was time for marlene to play a mother  there is nothing wrong with that in itself  as an actress she was up to the part  it s just that nothing else about the format has changed  it s like the blue angel plus a kid  fair enough  the story of a woman who drags her child along on her sleazy escapades is a sound premise for a tragic drama  but that s not the way this is played  dietrich s journey is played as some kind of adventure  using her wits and accomplices to stay ahead of the law  this is not some cheeky example of pre code libertarianism   it is just bizarrely distasteful   although we may be able to accept marlene is a doting mommy  there is absolutely no way we can buy sternberg as a director of warmth and poignancy  in spite of this being one of the handful of pictures for which he also took a writing credit  sternberg simply fails to get the story arc  the film s emotional payoff is supposed to be the eventual reunion of the family  but even at the beginning this is not established as something worth getting back to  as usual sternberg s interiors are dressed and shot to look like either brothels or insane asylums  the faradays  home is actually quite a creepy  dingy environment  and it s a wonder little johnny wasn t wetting the bed and asking to sleep with the light on   but as anyone familiar with them will know  the point of a dietrich sternberg picture is to make dietrich look fabulous  and in this respect at least blonde venus is a success  marlene is introduced emerging from a forest pool in a bright  shimmering close up  and even when she is reduced to rags the camera still loves her  the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast  whom sternberg tended to view as mobile pieces of scenery  the normally likable herbert marshall is here reduced to a moody grouch lurking in the shadows  even the suave and lively cary grant becomes just a boring  background blob  and does not seem nearly interesting enough for dietrich to run off with   the only standout moments in blonde venus are marlene s song and dance routines  especially the renowned hot voodoo number where she parodies her own surreal stage persona by emerging from a gorilla outfit  but even these feel like they have been cut and pasted from a different film  sternberg s fans may hail it as another masterpiece  as they are wont to do  but for the average punter it is a massive disappointment  audiences of the time did not lap it up as they had her earlier hits  and this heralded the beginning of the end for marlene s heyday  a year later there would be a new queen at paramount   mae west
