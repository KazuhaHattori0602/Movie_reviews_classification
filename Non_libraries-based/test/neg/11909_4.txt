this film s premise seems to be that the passing of the world war   generation in america  with its apple pie phoniness and hypocritical morality  was a terrible tragedy  those awful hippies ruined everything apparently   what holds the film together are the excellent performances   particularly lemmon s which is truly remarkable  otherwise we have a boring slice of life drama  just over   hours of jack s life  with pretensions   i found it a chore to sit through
