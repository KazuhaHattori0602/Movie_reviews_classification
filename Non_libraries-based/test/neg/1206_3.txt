don t bother to check for logic  there is none  but on the other hand  there are many really great movies that totally lack logic  so why bother   i both like and dislike this film  i like it because the action sequences in the air are really great  you get to see a lot of dogfighting  i also like the f  which is a very cool plane   but there are just too many goofs to make me really enjoy it  i guess it s not fair to wish for some sort of continuity  as it is hard to make a really good fighter film   but i also think there should be some sense of reason   and i have a question  do they fly from california to the middle east in f s without air refueling  i d like to see that happening
