this film was embarrassing in its clich s  poor acting and generally low production values  it starts out badly with the long haired   star general calling the hero  masters   major  when he is obviously wearing the silver oak leaves of lieutenant colonel  but what was most distressing was the crew of soldiers on neptune atoll  how out of touch with any kind of reality can you get  they were all experts on flying a   and the scenes of the soldiers digging the ditch were beyond comical   warning  this film is dangerous to your intellectual health  watch at your own peril
