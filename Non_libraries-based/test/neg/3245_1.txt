if you have seen this movie  then you will know that it is one of the worst bollywood movies ever made  bollywood is known to copy hollywood movies  who would of known that they will copy terminator   the difference between both film industries are hollywood spends millions and bollywood spends   thousands  average  thats the problem with this film  if you want to make a t  style movie  then do it properly  the director added a bogus fantasy storyline about a reincarnated snake who finds his long lost girl  in the previous birth  dead by   guys  but the blame goes to   people  she suddenly reincarnates into a ghost and together they want to kill the   people they blame for her death  not to mention  the reincarnated snake guy or villain has some kind of super powers  he can transform into anything  he can fly  disappear  fire power  wind power  you name it  he has it  he even gets bazookered and survives the t  style  you are probably wondering how he survives  its best not to ask  and its best not to waste time and money on this movie  its best just to forget this film even came out  i think its a shame to use a big starcast for this outrageous movie with a nonsense storyline
