i m not even going to comment on what piece of trash this film is since that has already been established  however  watching this with my friends we all laughed out loud when the lead girl made a shelley hack reference while on the phone  we sat there trying to figure out why the writer would throw her into the mix  we can only assume he had a charlie s angels fixation at one time  based on that reference  we assumed this film must have been made around her charlie s angels run in   or   but from what i ve read here it was made around   you sure couldn t tell that from the poor production values  it seems as though it was made by a college student for a film class  and while by no means would i expect a low budget trash fest like this to be politically correct  the rednecks in this film sure did like to direct derogatory gay remarks to each other  even so i d still only rank this as the  nd worst horror film ever made  second only to  nail gun massacre
