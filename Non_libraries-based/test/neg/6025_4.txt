since the characters begin with  unknown  identities  they not identified by name  so you start with handsome james caviezel waking up in a warehouse  he finds out the place is locked up tight  don t ask   the windows are made with security glass  and it s impossible to get out  four other awakening men make it a quintet   mr  caviezel in his  jean jacket  barry pepper in a  ranger shirt  greg kinnear with a  broken nose  joe pantoliano as a chair  bound man  and jeremy sisto shot and  handcuffed man  oh  man
   these five men have collective amnesia  they think that three of them are kidnappers  and two are victims   but  they don t know who is which or which is who  the forgetfulness is due to a pipe leak  don t ask   it happens  meanwhile  on the outside  lead lawman david selby  as parker  sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the men s wives  bridget moynahan  as eliza coles  frantically waits  but  criminal element s gang leader  peter stormare in  snakeskin boots  is also on his way to the scene   like the dvd synopsis says   as secrets are revealed and clues unraveled   the five men  must race against time to figure out who is good and who is evil in order to stay alive  this story reads a lot better than it looks on film  unfortunately  when the secrets are finally revealed  and memories become clear  there is no longer much interest in what has happened  simply  director simon brand has a great premise with matthew waynee s idea  but they encumber light investment in the characters holding the short end of the stick     unknown   simon brand   james caviezel  barry pepper  greg kinnear  david selby
