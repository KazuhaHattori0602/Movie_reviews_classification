i am not familiar with the producer s other works  but this movie is a piece of crap    i never saw the mst k version  but i can tell you  mike and the bots probably didn t save it    i love a grade z movie as much as the next bad movie fan  but this was almost unwatchable   there was no credit for who did the voice of  the dark one  sounded a bit like patrick stewart at times   a group of high school students who found a junk super  camera in the trash heap could make a better movie than that
