after reading the mostly glowing comments about this movie i decided to rent it despite some suspicions of tv movies  i should have followed my instincts   i tried so hard to warm up to the movie and find merit in it but i just couldn t  the story never draws you in or rings true and the acting is perfunctory at best and laughable at worst  everything in this production is amateurish   always a joy to watch  mary mcdonnell may be the only performer to escape this disaster without damaging her career or reputation  i won t even bother checking the name of the leading man   hopefully he s back doing commercials   even poor vanessa redgrave  whom i adore and respect  seemed to be channeling katherine hepburn all the time appearing as if she were really drugged in the home  maybe she needed the money   if i can save one person from wasting   minutes on this tripe i will feel vindicated
