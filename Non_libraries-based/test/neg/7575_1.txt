i absolutely positively can t believe my fellow imdb reviewers  all the praise about how  original  this movie is  it s like they ve never seen  ring  or the million of imitations that s come out in the   years since that movie  and some of them claim to be horror movie buffs  i think not   shutter  is okay  average  i d say  i give it   out of   but there s just no way it s original and great and  the most frightening thing i ve ever seen  as one reviewer said  puh leeeze  people  this one is plain  it s predictable   i swear  if i see another ghost movie where the hero traces the past of the ghost in order to find out why she s so mad and after them  i m going to scream    original  give me a break  you people need to get out more  or at least stop calling yourselves  horror movie fans
