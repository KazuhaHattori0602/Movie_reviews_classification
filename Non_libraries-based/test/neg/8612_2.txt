firstly  i ll admit i haven t seen vampires  los muertos  but i ve seen the original vampires film and love it  i rented this film having heard nothing about it  i didn t expect to be impressed  i wasn t   i love the idea of shifting the action to the far east  which should have opened up a lot of new avenues for the action sequences as well as the story line  but not enough was made of this  the fight scenes and the motorbike chases were painfully boring    there were some parts i liked  like the way the slayer team weren t shown as heroic good guys  as they were in the first movie   i d been hoping since i saw the old hammer movie legend of the   golden vampires a few years ago that someone would one day make another good asian based vampire film  this was not it
