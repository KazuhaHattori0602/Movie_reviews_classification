miserable film  not even to be compared in one breath with  to kill a mockingbird  or  in the heat of the night   yes  there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous    come now  would you really have elizabeth patterson  of all people  guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching  patterson  in her day  played everyone s mother and was the landlady in  i love lucy  before fred and ethel mertz bought the building   imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black man s gun killed a white man   claude jarman jr  who was so fabulous in  s  the yearling  appears in this mess  he still had those sad eyes  my eyes would be sad too if i appeared in this awful film   to me  this was nothing more than a faulkner flop all the way
