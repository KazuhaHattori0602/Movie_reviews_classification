hey  the grudge   what up  man  i have a friend i would like you to meet  the grudge   meet johnny s worst of   list  johnny s worst of   list meet the grudge    what s going on here  i was under the impression that this was supposed to be a sequel to the grudge rather than a remake  if that s the case then why does it do nothing but rehash the original  this floater doesn t even feel like a movie  it s just a  minute soundtrack of the weird contortionist chick making that annoying croaking sound   a sound on which i d recommend you not get me started  it was kind of creepy the first time i heard it  but i ve heard it about   times since   so it s pretty much run its course  and it s made even more annoying by the   people in the audience who thought it d be funny to imitate the sound whenever there was a quiet spot in the movie  sigh   folks  you re not funny so just shut up  i promise you  every single time that a character was walking slowly through an empty room  which is approximately   of the movie  somebody in the audience would start it up   uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk  yes  i know that s a horrible way to replicate the sound with letters  but you get the gist  so then some dude in the audience would giggle  and not to be outdone  deliver his own rendition  i was very close to just walking through the audience and punching random people   i told you not to get me started   there s absolutely nothing about the grudge   that i can recommend  there s not a single original scare or idea in the entire film  there s not one memorable acting performance  are you a sarah michelle gellar fan  welp  enjoy her two minutes of screen time and one line of dialogue  are you an amber tamblyn fan  i hope you can deal with the fact that she s given nothing more to do than walk around looking like she s suffering from a pinched nerve  can you believe the story  if you can call it that  is even worse than the grudge s    at least the original was fairly creepy and boasted a few effective jump scenes  i didn t jump once during this lametrosity  yeah  i made the word up  deal with it  that s right  not a single time  the  scares  are so manufactured and they are so blatantly telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value once the  gotcha  moment arrives  watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess   you re always four or five scenes ahead   there are also some weird scenes thrown in that make no sense whatsoever  one that immediately comes to mind is a scene where a girl drinks a gallon of milk and then begins to regurgitate it back into the jug  huh  i say huh  the audience laughed  i shook my head and sighed  there was a lot of that during the movie  laughing  sighing  head shaking  falling asleep  i did twice   the movie even makes a  th hearted attempt at a plot  twist  wow  it s so bad that i don t think we should even dignify it by labeling it a twist  did they really think anybody would be surprised at the revelation of who was hiding under the hoodie  please  it was as shocking as elton john coming out of the closet   and of course the ending goes the whole non closure  look  we might have another sequel  route  as soon as the credits rolled the audience booed  my sentiments exactly  had the audience paid money for this turd burger then things would have most likely gotten violent  and i would ve gladly led the charge   we learned from the grudge that there s a japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage  then a curse is left behind  much like a ben affleck movie  it s a  stain  that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred  well  in the grudge   we learn that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend then its sequel will be rushed out  and more often than not it will be as bad as this and will leave a stain on any theater where the movie shows   the gist   if you re a total wimp and never saw the grudge then this might provide a few cheap scares  but i strongly recommend saving your money  otherwise  there s a good chance you ll be the one walking out of the theater with a grudge
