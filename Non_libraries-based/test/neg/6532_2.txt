i saw this film at the   edinburgh international film festival    this film had been compared in the eiff program to sideways   which i liked   so i was quite looking forward to this movie  i also liked garden state  napoleon dynamite etc  so i have had good recent experiences with slightly weird american indy films   unfortunately  i found that puffy chair does not compare favourably with any of these movies   i was sitting for   minutes waiting for something amusing  witty  insightful or even mildly interesting to happen  it didn t   and the shaky video cam was making me sick   so i left   this is only the second film i have ever walked out from  the first was  showgirls  which is slightly disappointing  i probably could have lasted the duration had it not been for the nauseating effects of the wobbly picture   but nothing within the first   minutes gave me the impression that i would be missing anything   disappointing
