punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema  shot in the southern  california desert using his patent faux documentary style  watkins  creates a film like no other  he follows two groups of prisoners  one  pre sentenced the other post sentenced  throughout the picture  after   they re tried by a military tribunal  they have the choice of either  serving out a prison sentence or they can participate in punishment  park  a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but the  clothes on their backs  whilst being hunted down by local law  enforcement officers who use the park as a live action training  ground  i can t say enough about this movie  sometimes it feels as if  you re watching a real documentary  this is one of peter watkins most  accessible films  i advise you to look out for it  you wont regret it   highly recommended  a
