i haven t seen this fine movie in   years but i m entering a comment on it anyway   while jack webb s movie was no doubt intended purely as an entertainment   showing marine basic training at parris island in realistic terms as a tough character building exercise   it was said the military was afraid the movie would discourage recruitment s  it did not work out that way  the movie showed that entering the marines was a greater challenge than most young people ever realized  and  guess what  being offered a king sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted  i personally knew lots of guys that joined the marines shortly after seeing the di  lines at recruitment centers were suddenly so long the marines had more recruits than they could handle   so it goes  america will always have youth seeking to make themselves into the best   while the slackers and born losers limp along to nowhere    what we don t have in   is any films that inspire patriotism  devotion to duty of any kind  positive values  et cetera  what we do have is films that inspire the airhead ed to be airheads  the beer drinkers to guzzle beer  other negative values  exhibit   is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic superbad is now   in the all time great films list  values  what cha mean  values
