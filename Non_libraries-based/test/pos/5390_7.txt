gary cooper is a cool headed guy  always liked his easy going level headed characters  as some others have commented  there are some oddities in the script  such as a us marshall who got his job and can t even hit a barn with a pistol  a rancher with about thirty hands but can t seem to keep his cattle from being run off   but there is plenty of the quick thinking  straight shooting cooper to keep you entertained   this movie was made in   people in their  s and  s have trouble understanding those movies were made for entertainment not oscars    to expect oscar material does this film injustice  it is about the good guys finding a way to round up the bad guys   so rent  borrow  or buy this movie  pop some corn and enjoy the coop one more time
