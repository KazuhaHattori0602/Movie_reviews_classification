this was the film that started that the cinematic love affair  between the jaundiced eye crew and matthew ferguson  his  ability to portray relatively normal characters like birkoff in   la femme nikita  is counter balanced by his equally deft  handling of weirdos like  kane  one wishes that he would only  be given more roles  bigger roles  and other  even more complex  roles to assay to push the limits of his abilities  there were  four or five memorable scenes in this film  and matthew ferguson  stole two of them from far more experienced actors  this film  itself is good  and it is worth watching on its own merits  but  ferguson makes it a little extra special  his  ouevre  may  eventually show what the career of anthony perkins might have  been like if he hadn t been typecast as  norman bates  so long  ago   kane  isn t quite as whacked out as norman  and far fewer  people saw  love and human remains than saw  psycho  so we can  hope that ferguson will show us some hint of what perkins might  have been able to accomplish  had he been allowed to do so
