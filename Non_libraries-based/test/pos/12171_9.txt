i gave   of   points  i was sitting in tears nearly the whole movie  because i had to laugh   the story of course wasn t excellent  but it also wasn t boring  erkan   stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful nina  while doing this job they come between the  front lines  of bnd and cia  of course the two are neither born bodyguards nor gentlemen  so they run from one disaster into another  and they do this in such a funny way  that when you watch some scenes you won t be able to stop the tears  as actors those two  dumbly grinning  characters do quite well  better than some so called professional   you think  the speech of the two heroes is curios or  pseudo foreign  well  if you hear quite a lot turkish german people in munich speaking exactly like them  you will remember erkan   stefan  and maybe  in   years it might have become the common speech of the youth   god forbid   so  if you like to laugh  watch this movie
