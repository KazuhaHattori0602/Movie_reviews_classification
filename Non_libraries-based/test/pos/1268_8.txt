there are two things that i noticed in this film   this is not a spoiler  just a mistake in storytelling  when cole takes bill to his first b e  he finds the  box  as soon as cole finds it he says   the box  everyone s got a box  a minute later  just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says   we re actually very fortunate  you don t see these often   observation    spoiler alert   i had to watch the thing three times  i couldn t figure a couple of things out  then i watched the chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes  so at some points we were actually watching three different times in about   min of wall time   that was a good thing because i don t know how many more times i could watch it before returning it to netflix   color me obsessive
