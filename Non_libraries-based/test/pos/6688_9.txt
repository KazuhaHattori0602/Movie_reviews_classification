i m a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously  i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey  also   the general plot of  alien in human body  has  in my experience  been done to death  but i liked the approach taken in k pax  which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most  bridges makes an excellent doctor  you  want  to tell him what s on your mind  and spacey s expressions and gestures are perfect in the role   the interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful  particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviour   the ending is bittersweet   i like prot s choice  but the final scenes  with bridges  made me teary
