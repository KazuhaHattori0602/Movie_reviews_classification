when i first saw the poster of this movie  i discarded it off as another low budget movie targeting youth  after some days  when it finally made it to the theaters  one of my friends told me it s a good one   a year later  the first time when i saw the advertisement that  anand was going to be aired on television and the moment finally came as i flipped channels and for a moment i stopped to watch and that s it i ended up watching the whole movie   and by now    yrs later i d have watched the movie at least   times and i don t really watch movies again and again   this movie is great because it tries to be different  when all telugu movies were composed of   songs and   fights   it s a simple movie  a bit slow but a very gripping screenplay  there re no loose ends in the movie  very well versed dialogues  which is really really hard to find by   music is both classic and soothing  great renditions by radha krishnan  some great kirtanas also come in the bgmusic  through out the movie   cinematography  deserves a mention  editing is not slick but adequate for a romantic one such as this   but  what really blows you out in this movie is two things   the way each scene has been treated with utmost respect by  the now famous  shekar kammula     the beautiful lyrics by veturi   and one more thing deserves a special mention  kamalini  part of her success attributed to sunitha  for lending her such a beautiful voice  really tell you  the voice does wonders to me   the other actors  are equally good  raja in the title character and the little girl  and the way she shouts when she gets a new dog   ultimately  i can tell you this movie is soon on its way to be another classic with those old classic romantic ones  along with kammula s another classic romantic piece  godavari
