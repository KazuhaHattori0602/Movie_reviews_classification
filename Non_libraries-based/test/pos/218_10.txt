i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams  back in the early days at comedy central  back in those days  the  s  their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst k  complete with bearded host   capt  frank drebin  played by the stone faced  dead pan filibuster  leslie nielson  is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists  think dragnet meets starsky   hutch the show  boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios  this is distilled    times to produce the most pure policeman every made  forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz  for now  save it for later  frank drebin is clueless at most times  a terrible driver  a terrible shot  macho yet sensitive and vulnerable  he is a master of the police investigative methodology  a k a   ask johnny the leathery old shoe shine boy  this does not make him a bad cop  cops get lucky also  capt drebin  notice he s a captain here  has perfected it  along with his partner  nordberg  and the rest of force  perfectly parody the police drama over the course of   golden episodes   the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote ables  most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly  the magic never came from the sight gags however  at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground  with crazy things occurring in the background  the movies can best be described as   minute compilations of the best gags from this series  think of monty python s and now for something completely different   if you liked airplane       naked gun   or top secret  then you will definitely enjoy this    i always liked the series better than the movies  even though i saw the movies first  why    words   no o j
