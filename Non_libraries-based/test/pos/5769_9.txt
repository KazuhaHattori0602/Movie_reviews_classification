a sign of what to expect in this film came when i spotted that this was the first  and probably the last  film to have in its credits a  vomit technician   in what is a couple of hours of silly gags  hilarious violence and excellent slapstick humour   this film was just what you d expect from the bottom boys  and it is great to see them back in their best form after rik mayall s life threatening accident   richie  mayall  and eddie  edmondson  are too similar to their bottom characters  if we can have any criticism at all  and edmondson does a surprisingly good job in directing the film also   this film has already spawned the predictable comparisons to fawlty towers that just aren t there  and the guest house paradiso itself is hardly torquay   watch out for some excellently crafted dialogue amongst all the violence and mayhem   if you don t like bottom you ll probably hate this   but i loved it
