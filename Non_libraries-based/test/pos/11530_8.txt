it is   phoebe camilla belle  is an   year old girl growing up with an idealized vision of her   year old sister faith cameron diaz  faith is the doer  the truth seeker  the fixer of all the wrongs in the world  then one day  phoebe and her mother gail blythe danner  receive word that faith is dead  faith has killed herself  both phoebe and gail are overwhelmed by this news and  although saddened  gail mourns  phoebe can t let it go  phoebe decides to go to europe and find out what happened   it is now   phoebe jordana brewster  is   and decides to go to europe over the objections of her mother to discover the truth  when alive  faith was inseparable from a man she called  wolf christopher eccleston  though wolf claimed not to know anything about faith s last days  phoebe convinces him to tell her everything  within days  wolf realizes that he hadn t let go of the past either and he joins phoebe on her pilgrimage to portugal   in the end  wolf is able to tell of faith s decent into drug abuse and his own guilt at not preventing the suicide  although angry  phoebe realizes in the end how human and fragile faith really was   i liked this movie  i m old enough to remember the bank robberies of the red army and i was   in   this story was familiar ground for me  i can still remember young men trying to decide if they should go to canada or not to avoid the draft   the story is simple  but probably occurred several times in real life during that period  camilla belle was enjoyable and fun to watch as she portrayed the young adoring sister excited by what was happening around her  jordana brewster slid easily into the role of the older phoebe  blythe danner was the ever supportive mother  a role she is all too familiar with on american tv  unfortunately  i would have liked to see her with stronger material to work with  cameron diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly  though at times  her performance of a  s activist seemed to come off a news reel  of all the characters  it was christopher eccleston s wolf  that made the most growth  when we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the movie  we can see he is a worldly man  he is a patient and kind man filled with anger at the world s injustices  in the end  he realizes the direction he and faith are headed is wrong and begins to  grow up  deciding he should fight against injustice in his own way  faith refuses to join him in this and it eventually leads to her death  eccleston s wolf is the most real of all the characters   i recommend this movie  it was enjoyable and thought provoking   the invisible circus  is rated tv ma  but there is very little cursing  sex or violence in it  the subject of the movie is the reason for the rating
