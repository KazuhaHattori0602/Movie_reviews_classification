well  this is new famous italian horror director lucio fulci shoots a film about a famous italian horror director called lucio fulci  after years and years of witnessing gruesome horror sequences  it becomes hard for lucio to separate reality from fiction and he often hallucinates about committing violent murders  he quickly descends further into a seemly endless spiral of madness and unverifiable venom  even the dedicated psychiatrist can t seem to keep fulci on the right track  now  when it comes to pure fun and entertainment value  cat in the brain certainly is one of fulci s most pleasant films  the gore is overpowering and copious  to say the least  the amount of filthy massacres is impossible to describe  especially when you manage to get your hands on the fully uncut version  referred to with the aka nightmare concert  decapitations all around  victims   intestines are spread on all sides of the screen and the chainsaws are working overtime  the film also becomes unintentionally funny quite soon  since it s so exaggerated  and a perfect experience to watch with a group of friends when there s beer in the fridge  of course  from a more professional viewpoint  this production can t exactly be called a masterpiece  there s not the least bit of tension or atmosphere to detect and the characters are completely empty headed  in order to make more room for the gore  characters are just being introduced for   seconds and subsequently die a horrible death  especially compared with fulci s highlights   like  the beyond  or  don t torture a duckling    this film looks like a quickly warmed up snack  the best way to interpret  cat in the brain  is like a personal statement made by fulci and a direct attack towards censorship  perhaps after seeing so many of his films   especially the latter ones   being cut by censorship committees and bashed by pseudo artistic critics  he wanted to avenge himself by delivering a gory mess that simply can t be cut  if you take out all the explicit violence and the truly sick make up effects  you only got about   minutes of footage left  especially because the insane killings re occur later in the film as fulci hallucinates about them again  you can almost hear our director think stuff like   let s see how you re going to censor this now  even the entire development of the murder investigation happens in the background  are the victims missed by any of their friends or relatives  are there any police officers looking for clues that ll lead them to the killer  you don t know and lucio doesn t bother to inform you about that  because that would lead to sequences that don t require cutting  oh  and it s pretty damn pretentious as well  the name  mr  fulci  or even  lucio  is mentioned every   minutes   times throughout the entire movie  to be exact  and our director clearly enjoys being in the spotlights for a change  hey  i certainly don t blame him after over   years of delivering amusing movies  he deserved to have a little extra fun  you re a god  mr  fulci
