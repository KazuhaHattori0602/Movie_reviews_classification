a few things to touch on as a response to the earlier person s comment  you just have to pay attention to what is going on in the film    i guess they are spoilers   the red stuff under david s mouth  poison ivy  the wife says not to scratch it or else  it will spread   david goes  insane  because the stranger is telling him to get out of the house  which probably proves david s theory of an affair happening between the wife and stranger  he runs after the man    david does not lose him in the woods  he simply hits the stranger a couple of times and leaves it to his wife to pick up the pieces   only the wife eats the mushroom    i must say  after that one point with the wife and stranger  i began to feel disappointed  but the ending made up for the entire film   and for that and the very last scene  this is one of my favorite movies ever  i should have put it together earlier  but let myself get sidetracked  i was really surprised  honestly   this film is interesting  to say the least  but if you are not watching this for the performances that the actors give  i d say you better let this one go  because that is all that keeps this certain film together
