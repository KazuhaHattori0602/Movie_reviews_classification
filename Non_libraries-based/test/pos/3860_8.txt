the first disney animated film without the strong involvement of disney himself  this film suffers from the fact that the story is not particularly original or interesting  this is  i believe  the only animated disney film since the  s which is not based on an earlier book or other work  but is rather an original story  as others have noted  the plot is essentially a cross between the romance in lady and the tramp and the kidnapping journey home story in   dalmatians   but to overcome this flaw  the filmmakers have successfully used many of the better features of most of the disney animated films of the previous   years  phil harris  from the jungle book  voicing one of the main characters  follows his duet with louis prima in the previous film with another here with scatman crothers  the quality visual look of this film is virtually carried over from  dalmatians   with some nice nods to french impressionism  it appears  and the villain here  the butler  is strongly reminiscent of the henchmen in that film as well   this is probably one of disney s least memorable villains  the main story goes back and forth between the cats  and the butler s ongoing difficulties with two rural hound dogs  with great voice work by pat buttram and george  goober  lindsey  the various animal characters are similarly familiar to those who have seen  tramp  and  dalmatians  the cats  owner  while bearing a striking visual resemblance to the wicked stepmother in sleeping beauty  bears none of that character s nasty traits and comes across as very warm and generous   the real strength of the film is the voice work  after first going toward the use of mostly familiar actors in the jungle book  the tactic is continued strongly here with disney veterans harris and sterling holloway from the jungle book  and eva gabor  who would do a very similar character in the later film the rescuers  as well as crothers and nancy kulp  all are excellent here  particularly harris and gabor in the leads  the character animation is as excellent as one would expect  showing a variety of emotions well   smaller children may be upset by a few brief episodes  an escape from the path of a speeding train  a near drowning by one of the children  but these are not presented in a particularly frightening or dark manner and are over very quickly  overall  there s very little of the type of more frightening scenes found in many other disney classics   one minor oddity is the way some visual aspects of  s culture are depicted among the jazz performing cats in supposedly   paris  one can t help but wonder why the story wasn t set solidly in the present  other than the great deal paris had changed much of its appearance in the intervening time  it really would have made more sense that way   the songs  while being pleasant and sometimes very enjoyably performed  are not particularly memorable  nonetheless  the general energy applied here  the excellent voice work and fine animation all contribute to overcome the relatively few and minor weaknesses  far from the greatness of classic  s such as pinocchio or aladdin  and not quite up to the  s one might give to sleeping beauty or   dalmatians  this is probably a rather marginal   of   perhaps a
