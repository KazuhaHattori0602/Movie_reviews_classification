christopher nolan s first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out  shot on a micro budget of   this is a student film with real class  the film is shot in black and white  and features people who you assume are friends of nolan s appearing in the movie  this is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good  you could see jeremy theobald and alex haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven t since this was made   years ago   nolan s thriller  much like memento  does not play chronologically  it shifts the scenes around much like pulp fiction  the writing is fantastic  it is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting  i thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent   for a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all  this is so good  it is superior to most that hollywood studios offer and nolan after three films  this  the superior memento and the not quite as good but still excellent insomnia  has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times  i can t wait for batman   this film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch  it is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising  i also thought that the score from david julyan was also excellent  very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it  he has gone on to compose nolan s other films    overall i would recommend this  i intend to get all of nolan s films  this is a low budget gem
