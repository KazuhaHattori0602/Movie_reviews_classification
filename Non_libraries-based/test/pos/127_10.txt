previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film s plot details than i could  what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful  in every sense   emotionally  visually  editorially   just gorgeous   if you like movies that are wonderful to look at  and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant  i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art   on a scale of   to   i d give it about an   the only reason i shy away from   is that it is a mood piece  if you are in the mood for a really artistic  very romantic film  then it s a   i definitely think it s a must see  but none of us can be in that mood all the time  so  overall
