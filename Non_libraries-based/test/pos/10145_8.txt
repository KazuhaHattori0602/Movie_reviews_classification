this is another enjoyable and entertaining hitchcock film  james stewart and doris day are incredible in this movie  bernard herrmann appears as himself near the climax   the scenery and locations are great  except the one scene early on where the background was obviously fake  which doesn t make sense to me since scenes before and after were in the same setting and they were real location shots  i ve heard that hitchcock did this on purpose sometimes   the reviews for this movie seem to be mixed  i think this is a better than average hitchcock movie  very entertaining and it has a great light comical scene at the end   i rated this movie   out of
