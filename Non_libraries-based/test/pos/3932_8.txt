i saw a sneak preview of this tuesday night with a group of friends and we had a blast  after seeing sneak peaks for boogeyman  horrible    and amityville remake  so so   i enjoyed this a lot more  as seen in the trailer  one knock i had was believing that a whole town could be  forgotten  but this is a cheesy popcorn horror movie so i accept it for what it is   my only major complaint is i assumed paris hilton would touch wax or get dipped etc  and moan  that s hot  but they didn t do that  how could they resist   there is no nudity from the   girls although paris looks great in her lingerie  i m surprised they didn t put a  rd  hot token victim  in the movie for some needless nudity which is the norm for this type of flick  i won t list any death or plot spoilers but i will say that paris   eliza both get roughed up good    the characters are developed decently and are somewhat likable  not like cabin fever where you wanted them to die  and the movie has a decent pace although nothing happens in the  st   minutes like most horror films   i give it a   as it delivered good scares and gore and i had low expectations going into it  if you go with some friends that like cheesy horror movies you ll have a good time   noah
