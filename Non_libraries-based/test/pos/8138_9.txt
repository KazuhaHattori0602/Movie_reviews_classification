this short movie intends to focus on one issue sociologically known as cultured shock  the film presents the condition of average romanian in democratic romania who finds out that the life and the problems are not different from communist period  and if you want something  you must bribe around to get it   so  our main character is fired after a long while  he is around   and needs to get a similar job  but the only job available is one inferior  he is forced to take it because the lack of money   my opinion is that you have to live in romania so that this movie can be as real and tragic as it seems
