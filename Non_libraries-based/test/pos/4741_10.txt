after watching  waco  the rules of engagement  i was just sitting in disbelief of what i was witness to  a big cover up by the fbi  a massacre by gung ho trigger happy government agents  i clearly remember the waco standoff  i was   years old at the time and watched it all on cnn  i remembered reflecting about all the children as i watched the mount camel compound burn in april   i remember feeling sorry for the children  but clearly felt that it was the fault of their evil leader david koresh and the other davidians  gazecki s film shows clearly and beyond doubt  even though it is biased  that the fbi lied over and over again  i think that this film was a big contributor to the reopening of a new investigation of the incident in   the outcome of this new investigation was in some sense predictable  the judgement relied on fact that was just as grey as the facts that the davidians presented  i was very disappointed about the verdict  because as far as i know it didn t take into account all the lying  misinformation and evidence cover up by the fbi and other officials  why have no one be prosecuted for hampering the work of the texas rangers investigators  why were they allowed to contaminate the crime scene and bulldoze the compound shortly after the incident  these are questions that i haven t been given answers to by the government  most importantly  what about the children  in this new investigation i haven t been informed about who was responsible for spraying the cs flammable tear gas into a compound with many hazards for igniting this gas and i haven t found any answer to whether the children s muscles contracted due to the effects of the gas  while they were alive  if they did  i would surely think that the janet reno or who ever was in charge of the raid should be indicted for mass homicide or manslaughter  the question that was raised by gazecki  but not mentioned is  was is a direct plan for the people in charge and their tanks to cut holes and burn the building down with intent   a plan that would have been accomplished with   efficacy  or were the officials in charge so incompetent  that their were unaware of the consequence of their actions  both are equally frightening  even if the davidians set fire to the compound  the officials in charge surely provided them with the opportunity to do the job  if the officials in charge knew  as they claimed  that the davidians would set fire to the compound  why the f
 did the tanks cut all the holes in the building making it into a furnace and why didn t they have plans to deal with the fire that they knew would occur  dark questions that still won t go away the final and most relevant issue of this film  is the way that the davidians are demonized by the government through the media  who just feeds it in to the public  i clearly remember the resentment i felt for the evil davidians that i saw on cnn in   now that i m older i can see a clear line of communication coming out of the government every time they are gearing up for a massacre of civilians along with the intended targets  demonizing people with words like   they have different unlawful values then us   they don t enjoy freedom  and  they are a threat to our freedoms and way of life  makes them so much easier to kill
