i can t believe i missed this one  made in   with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a tv soap  this is   minutes of sustained  sharp as a knife film making  you will find the outline  plot etc elsewhere on this site consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single  hand  held mm camera  all the dialogue is improvised  none of the  actors  had appeared in front of a camera before  it sounds like a recipe for disaster  instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the california desert in what evolves into a  that s not fair  i m on that person s side scenario  the only problem is  the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of   minutes we re still not sure who has one  brilliant  quite brilliant
