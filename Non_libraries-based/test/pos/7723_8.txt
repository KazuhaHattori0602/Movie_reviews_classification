this movie is a quite fair adaptation of the prosper merime s novel  in the novel merime  himself is a character  don jos  is from navarra  north spain  and historically a basque country zone  they can speak basque language  they are in seville  andalusia  south spain  and they only speak spanish with andalusian accent  in no way they speak basque  but carmen explains to don jos  that she was living in navarra  you can believe it or not  anyway this is the book s version  then you can t be critical with the movie about this  be with the book  you have to note are different the novel by merime  and the opera by bizet  and this movie is an adaptation from the novel  anyway in the opera don jos  is still spanish from navarra  never he s french  why so many people keep thinking don jos  is french  i don t know but i guess because the novel and the opera are in french although is supposed to be in spanish   the only important difference between the movie and the novel is that in the movie don jos  also kills the  torero  lover of carmen and in the novel he doesn t  neither in the opera  i guess they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore  i think the movie is quite good  anyway
