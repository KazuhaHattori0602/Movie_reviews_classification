james joyce  arguably  could write some of the best sentences in the english language  and his short story   the dead  which ends his collection the dubliners  contains in its finale perhaps the most perfect paragraph in the english language  it s fitting that john huston  who held back in attempting to film this story  ended his career with it  as with the red badge of courage and the man who would be king  huston revered the literary source but made the adaptation cinematic  and with  the dead   which was completed after huston s death by his son  tony huston  we get something nearly perfect in the marriage of literature and cinema   valuing all that cinema can do  as one of the commentators points out  this isn t the african queen   nor does it need to be  this is the kind of movie that is uncompromising for an audience  all of us slogged through portrait of an artist in school  and one needs to bring the maturity of appreciating how words and images in and of themselves can touch us  as with silent films  huston seeks something pure here  and he works with the confidence of his many years and leaves the world a masterpiece that equals joyce s original   many veterans of the irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a man filled with self importance  and mock self doubt  that s reinforced by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the feast of the epiphany  what s in store for gabriel conroy is an evening of celebration  song  dance  poetry where he s asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their niece who host the party  he s distracted by the task wanting to rise to the occasion  and this distraction leaves him vulnerable for an earth shattering experience  handed to him by his wife  while his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife s past  it s also a gift where all that seems to have mattered throughout the evening is swept away by the realization of impending mortality for all who are living   and rather than trying to make the last famous paragraph of the story  cinematic  huston brings in a voice over and we hear those incredible words recited as we watch  the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling  it s the perfect solution to a filmmaker s adaptation   the cast is all we would hope  since this is basically a testament to the power of the written word and how it brings us together through common experience each performer seems elevated by their role  anjelica huston as gretta conroy has a wide range to play  and her account of a young boy who once loved her sears not only gabriel conroy  but the audience as well   when i think of anjelica huston  it s the transformation she makes in this film  and when i think of her father  it s this film i remember first
