as a lesbian  i am sick and tired of being portrayed in movies and on tv as a sad person  forever vacillating between suicide and homicide  but never destined to find happiness    if  like me  you are fed up with hollywood s anti lesbian propaganda  you ll breathe a sigh of relief at this delightful offering from the bbc  nan astley is the daughter of an oyster house restaurateur who  wonders why she can t feel the way she should about freddy   one of the local lads who has his eye set on her  she falls   and falls hard   for kitty butler  a male impersonator with a visiting theatre troupe  nan accompanies kitty to london as her dresser
   not everything that happens to nan is pleasant in this story  and some of the things she does are not squeaky clean either   but she will win your heart  and her story of love triumphant will leave you with a beautiful lump in your throat at the end   if you are a lesbo hating macho man or a homophobic housewife  or some brand of religious fundamentalist who believes that homosexuals should die and go to hell  this series is not for you  but if you have a heart  and you believe in love  you will cry at the end as much as i did
