a great show   first  to the people who don t like it don t like it  then don t watch it   this is was  an awesome show  better than according to jim  a favorite of mine  it shows a real family household  as opposed to   simple rules etc  where everything goes peachy   they re loud  they re messy i can sympathize with their dragging all the garbage into the kitchen  it happens in real life sorta like the  portal to hell  and everyone growling like dogs over the fast food boxes   it s a  been there  show you know what s coming  but fun to watch  because you have been there before   a good cast  they work great together  a admirable enough show to warrant a dvd release  mel gibsons  safety videos  were a highlight of the series as well   opinion  good show  really deserving of a dvd release  deserving to not be canceled as well
