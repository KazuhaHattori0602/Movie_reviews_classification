 the king of queens  could be divided into two eras   the first era  constituted of the first few seasons portrayed the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife making it through life in the city paycheck by paycheck   the second era  increased the scope of the show  addressing current popular culture and marital issues with a humorous spin   but besides all of that   this show was freaking hilarious   kevin james  when not doing crap comedy films with adam sandler  is a genius of laughter  and his chemistry with leah remini was unparalleled on tv   jerry stiller as the psychotic live in father in law added his own unique style of quirky humor  and patton oswalt as the  man child  spence ulchin was amazing   he s a great comedian too   the king of queens  was the final sitcom of the  s to go off the air  and it s a damn shame  now  all we have to watch are the idiotic sitcoms full of untalented actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance  i like many fans of actually funny tv shows am now in a state of mourning
