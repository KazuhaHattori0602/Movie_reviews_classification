sometimes the academy doesn t recognize the potential of some films  or doesn t nominate them because they are controversial or strong  sometimes they are nominated  but don t win anything  i hope this doesn t happen this year with  american beauty  this is exactly what happened with  boogie nights  which was the best film of   the academy preferred to give the best picture oscar to  titanic  a purely commercial and hollow film  and other awards to the overrated  good will hunting  and the irritating  full monty  the other pictures which were nominated in the main category were  l a  confidential  and  as good as it gets  great movies  but  boogie nights  is still better and should have been remembered in more categories   this amazing film tells the story of eddie adams  mark wahlberg  in a surprisingly great performance  a   year old barman who takes the attention of jack horner  burt reynolds  in a redeeming acting  a director of porn films  eddie has a special  gift  and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies  he changes his name for dirk diggler and starts to make a huge success  but fame  doesn t last forever  other characters also have their parallel stories  amber waves  julianne moore  perfect  buck  don cheadle  and others  including rollergirl  heather graham  an actress who accepts to do anything  but she has to be wearing her roller shoes   what could have been a banal  trivial film  turns into a perfect  memorable one in the hands of paul thomas anderson  what makes  boogie nights  such a great film is its execution  added to a clever  well written screenplay  great soundtrack  etc  each character is very well developed  and each of them has his her importance in the context  each feeling  weakness  fear  emotion is explored  resulting in a masterpiece of the modern american cinema    boogie nights  is a strong  impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema  under a plot that seems banal at first impression  there is a wonderful story of highs and downs  things that we face in our lives  it is an amazing portrait of the end of the  s and the beginning of the  s  exactly an age of highs and downs  that s what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece
