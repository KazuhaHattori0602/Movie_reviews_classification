great film about an american g i  who quits the army to marry a german girl who saved his life in the last days of the war  she accepts  but does she do it because she really likes him  or because he can support her with easier access to food and such  meanwhile  her brother and an old friend form an anti american terrorist group called the werewolves  their purpose to drive away the occupants  you might remember the same group playing a major part in lars von trier s film europa  zentropa  james best  best known for his role as roscoe p  coltrane in the  s television show the dukes of hazzard  is shockingly excellent as the american  he should have become a big movie star   at this age he reminds me very much of warren beatty  the other main actors are good  as well  fuller s direction is quite good  using a lot of long takes again  although they are not nearly as complex as they were in park row  the long takes more often than not consist of long scenes with a lot of dialogue  the only problems lie in the script  as seems to be the case with all of the fuller films that i ve seen  it s not too badly flawed  but it ought to have been expanded  fleshing out major characters and parts of the script  helga  the wife  goes through a major change  but completely off screen  therefore  the emotional center rests squarely on best s shoulders  fuller also should have killed off the sick mother early in the film  i hope that doesn t sound too harsh  she just doesn t really do anything throughout the film except lie in bed  she has so few lines  but fuller keeps bringing her up as the film goes on  i would have had her death solidify david and helga s relationship myself  and the film ends too abruptly  and it lacks payoff  these aren t really the biggest flaws in the world  the way i described them makes them sound bigger than they are
