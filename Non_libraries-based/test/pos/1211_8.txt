in the  s in wrestling the world was simple  hulk hogan would take on roddy piper  or bobby heenan s cronies or ted dibiase and come out victorious more often than not  occasionally he would get an ally like randy savage in   but mostly it was all about hulk hogan vs bobby heenan  and that s the way it should be   but on this night that was about to change  a new champion  a man who the wwe thought would be their man for the  s was crowned  it didn t work out  but the wwe was right about one thing  hulkamania was finished and a new order needed to be established   this historic wrestlemania  the first to be held outside america  kicked off with rick martel defeating koko b ware  koko never really had a lot of luck at wrestlemania and was taken down in short order here   next up the colossal connection andre the giant and haku put their tag team titles on the line against demolition ax and smash and lost  new tag team champions crowned   next match saw earthquake defeat hercules  hercules was another fellow who didn t really have a lot of luck at wrestlemania  plenty of luck for brutus beefcake as he ended mr perfect s undefeated streak  well  i guess someone had to end it   roddy piper and bad news brown fought to a double count out in a slow but fun match  next up the hart foundation defeated nikolai volkov and boris zhukov in   seconds  not really a match  unfortunately  the barbarian then defeated tito santana in a short match   the american dream dusty rhodes and saphire then defeated the macho king randy savage and queen sherri in a messy mixed tag match  this was the only female wrestling really going on in the wwe at this point of time   next up was a fun match as the rockers marty janetty and shawn micheals defeated the orient express in a fast paced encounter  there were a lot of good tag teams at this point in time  jim duggan then beat dino bravo in a nothing match   next ted dibiase put his most cherished possession  the million dollar championship on the line against jake roberts  roberts was distracted by virgil and counted out allowing ted to retain his title in an entertaining match and one of the longer matches on the show   next up the twin towers collide as the big bossman defeats akeem in short order  this is followed by rick rude winning a short match with jimmy snuka   finally we come to the main event with hulk hogan putting the wwe title on the line against intercontinental champion the ultimate warrior  this is an entertaining back and forth match won by the warrior after hogan missed a leg drop  the crowd was extraordinary and the match was a great spectacle   and so the torch was passed  but would the ultimate warrior prove to be the champion the wwe hoped he would be
