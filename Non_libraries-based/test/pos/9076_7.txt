this is definitely a good movie unlike what other people are saying  peline and i have both seen the movie  x and the end is cheesy but that is part of the package  to experiment with death is the same as trying to defy it  so the movie is cool  for those who wish to see a classic kevin bacon movie  see this please  take care greeting from istanbul  we will write   lines if you really want us   but we think it is a waste of time bye  the rest of this review should not be taken seriously because we just wrote it to fill the   line requirement  which is crazy  but we are kind people and will therefore adapt to the rules that are set out for us  so people watch this movie not because we wrote   lines  but because it is good  and by the way we wrote   lines
