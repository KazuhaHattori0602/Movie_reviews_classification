i really really liked this one  i know  it s rampant with what are now clich  plot lines  and plenty of overacting  but it was hell of a lot of fun   in our quest for  s and  s horror cheese  we come across many flicks that are so bad they re good  we also have some that are so  good  they suck  and then  we have some that are so bad they are just bad  this is definitely so bad it s good   some teens traveling come across an  oasis  in the middle of nowhere  a forgotten slice of roadside america  and they decide to  check it out  they cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it  they pay dearly   i would not normally give a movie like this a   but the girls in this one are the type that we miss from the  s  ditzy  scantily clad and fit  these aren t the anorexic broads from today s horrible horror  they look awesome in booty shorts   i give it a   out of   kids
