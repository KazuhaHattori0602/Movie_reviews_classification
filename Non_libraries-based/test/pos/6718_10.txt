danny boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers  that honour belongs to lifeforce  which is  of course  the greatest naked space vampire zombies from halley s comet running amok in london end of the world movie ever made  tobe hooper may have made a lot of crap  but for this deliriously demented epic sci fi horror he deserves a place among the immortals  plus it offers space vampire mathilda may  the best thing to come out of france since simone simon  spending the entire movie naked  which she does very  very well  just bear in mind that while she is the most overwhelmingly feminine presence anyone on earth has ever encountered  she s also  totally alien to this planet and our life form and totally dangerous  it s a pitch meeting i d have loved to have sat in on  astronauts from the british space program find three naked humanoid alien life forms inside a giant  mile long artichoke umbrella shaped spaceship hidden in the tail of halley s comet filled with giant desiccated bats and bring them back to earth with near apocalyptic results as they proceed to drain the population of london of their lifeforce amid much nudity  whirlpools of thunder and spit your coffee across the room direlogue  i ve been in space for six months  and she looks perfect to me   assume we know nothing  which is understating the matter   don t worry  a naked woman is not going to get out of this complex  oh  and we ll get the writers of alien and blue thunder to write it with uncredited rewrites by the writer of mark of the devil  the sex thief and eskimo nell and the director of the jonestown monster  sounds like a winner  here s  m   have fun  and they do  they do   true  there s enough promise in the raw material to have made something genuinely creepy and thought provoking  at a time when aids hysteria was approaching its height  a sexually transmitted  plague  offers ample opportunity for allegory  but in the hands of the go go boys at cannon  what could have been another quatermass and the pit quickly turns instead to be more plan   from outer space  it s full to bursting with delirious inanity  be it frank finlay s hilarious death scene  here i go  peter firth s grand entrance  i m colonel caine   from the sas  discreetly shouts michael gothard across a room full of reporters   gentlemen  that last remark was not for publication  this is a d notice situation  he replies to the surprisingly obliging pressmen  the security guards offering mathilda may s naked space vampire a nice biscuit to stop her escaping  reanimated bodies exploding into dust all over people  the sweaty prime minister sucking the life out of his secretary and london filling up with zombie nuns  stockbrokers and joggers as the city gets its most comprehensive on screen trashing since mrs gorgo lost junior at battersea funfair and went on the rampage  and that s not mentioning the  this woman is a masochist  an extreme masochist  scene or the great stereophonic echo effect on the male vampire s  it ll be a lot less terrifying if you just come to me  line while a lead stake wielding peter firth adopts his best action man voice to reply  i ll do just that  in one scene alone you have a possessed patrick stewart embodying the female in our deeply confused astronaut hero s mind  steve  i never got over playing charlie manson  railsback and his amazing dancing eyebrows in full on  helta skelta  mode trying to resist the temptation to kiss him  the inimitable aubrey morris  the only man who makes freddie jones look restrained  playing the home secretary sir percy heseltine as a kind of demented brian rix  peter firth  one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a doctor who around the time no one was watching it anymore  hamming up the blas  public school macho in the hope that no one will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of john hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door mid psychic tornado to bring in more drugs  as if they needed any more in this film  it s just a shame that frank finlay s mad haired scientist who isn t qualified to certify death on alien life forms  a role originally intended for klaus kinski  missed out on the action in that one   no matter how mad you think the film is  it still manages to get madder still  whether it be a zombie pathologist  he too needs feeding  exploding all over the home secretary s suit  patrick stewart s blood and entrails forming a naked mathilda may or the space vampires turning st paul s cathedral into the world s biggest laser show to transport human souls from the london underground to their geostationary mother ship  i loved every gloriously insane moment  in it s own truly unique way  this might be the greatest film ever made   the dvd offers the original  minute version that opened in the uk rather than the heavily edited  minute us version  which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar  but also fully restores henry mancini s score to its original glory  the us version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by michael kamen and james guthrie  although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight  mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic universal sci fi horrors of the  s and his score is quite superb  with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from blake edwards  sadly there s no more than a trailer by way of extras  though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from hooper s originally intended  minute cut  from what s on display here  these might just offer even more comedy gold
