words alone cannot describe the sheer beauty and power of this film   think  toy story  now  think  toy story  circa   now  imagine the animation looks as lifelike  as fluid  think of the movie not as something adults and children can enjoy  but imagine it as a filme noire   imagine trying to do something like that back in   somehow   the mascot  delivers  in a story where toys come to life  and one of them is trying to deliver an orange to his sick owner  starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpected  it s so fluid  you will wonder for a long time whether what you see is really stop motion animation    comparing  toy story  and  the mascot  is an excercise in futility  plot wise  while  toy story  is a children s story adults can enjoy   the mascot  is a dark  chilling story aimed at adults  meaning  no  your kids won t like it  one bit   still  get it if you can  you might be able to find it along  vampyr  in dvd and laserdisc  and prepare to be stunned at what starewicz was able to do back in   with a couple of puppets
