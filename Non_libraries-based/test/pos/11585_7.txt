 facts  i   mar adentro  relates the well known  at least in spain  story of ram n sampedro  a galician quadriplegic who killed himself  helped by some friends  after   years prostrated by his condition  judges had denied several times his petitions of active euthanasia    facts  ii   mar adentro  becomes the movie of the year in spain  everyone talks about it  politicians  singers  ordinary people  everyone likes it  even the critics  opinions are unanimous  the film wins a lot of prizes  golden globe  oscar  goya  and annoys catholic community and life lovers quadriplegics  a star is born    facts  iii  the intensity and the quality of the actors in  mar adentro  are just amazing  and this makes mi wonder how come we have to watch the same bad young actors in the most of spanish latest movies  i don t know if javier bardem is a great actor or a great imitator  there s quite a difference between one thing or the other  anyway  his job is just impressive  as well as lola due as  bel n rueda s  or the job of all the guest starrings  this is  the actors selection  the strong point in amen bar s movie    facts  iv  alejandro amen bar learned his lesson there at the cinema school  there s no doubt about it  he s got a privileged brain  he takes good control of each and every one of the technical aspects  he knows what the audiences want  he knows how to touch the right chord  even if that turns him into such a demagogue  just like spielberg is  one of amen bar s idols    facts  and v  if you criticize a movie such as  mar adentro  it will seem like you have any kind of trouble with the moral issue the story tells about  there s a trap in this kind of pictures  you have to differentiate between the movie itself and the moral concepts  if you don t like  schindler s list  that does not mean that you agree with hitler s philosophy  or do you  so  for me  it is a good film and an extraordinary story  since it is a real story that makes it much more extraordinary  grandiloquent  self kind  and everything but neutral  no matter what amen bar or bardem have said about it  those characters that are not in favor of euthanasia come to no good at all      hard     way too sentimental    epilogue   mar adentro  wouldn t be by no mean in my ranking of the best  s spanish movies of all time  nobody has special merits in the story but ramon sampedro himself  he is the movie  now  alejandro amen bar is gonna become the more international spanish director ever  maybe he ll go to live to hollywood  but some of us would like to watch him filming a simple story  without bit final twists  without living dead nor dying alive   the others  is still his best movie    my rate
