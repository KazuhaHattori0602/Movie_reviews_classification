don t torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo diversion for lucio fulci  unlike other subgenre heavyweights like mario bava and dario argento  fulci takes a decidedly gritty  grounded  and socially perceptive approach to the giallo narrative in this film  there is nothing glamorous about the child murders and borderline pedophilia  a gutsy subplot for   going on here  and fulci wisely shoots with a staid and lugubrious eye  avoiding flash  melodrama  and directorial histrionics  the proceedings are punctuated by gory and instantly mind searing set pieces that are bolstered even further by fulci s jarring sense of realism  the deeply disturbing  witch killing  scene in particular  with its bald faced brutality  feels like a snuff film  composer riz ortolani bookends these carnage filled scenes with ferocious reverberating string blasts   the film is capped by a simultaneously lyrical and violent conclusion wherein theology  morality  fanaticism  and superstition collide  it is a deeply effective ending that has the capacity to leave the viewer in a befuddled and disarmed torpor   fulci couldn t have picked a better location for this film  don t torture a duckling was photographed in and around the ancient city of matera  italy  as matera continues to modernize to this day  highlighted by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one  it is grappling with its unesco sponsored reputation as a receptacle for mysterious paleolithic ghosts  the anxieties of the real life materani are reflected by the characters in the film  who  wearing their christianity on their sleeves  fretfully confront any exotic fringe tradition  namely witchcraft  that strays outside of the norm   interestingly enough  matera was also used as a stand in for jerusalem in mel gibson s the passion of the christ  if anything  this adds even more potency to fulci s message  catholic guilt and grisly slayings are such a resonant combination
