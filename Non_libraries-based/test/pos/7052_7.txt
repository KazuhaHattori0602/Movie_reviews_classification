as a young teen when this came out  i completely related to it  as an adult in the present sex  obsessed american culture  it doesn t have enough nudity to be called tame    if you are looking for american pie type lewdness  vulgarity or fart and feces jokes  meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee    if you like bill murray  and you like good clean fun  you will probably like and enjoy this film very much  similarly with stripes  ghostbusters  caddy shack  etc    enough said  just go watch it  and stop intellectualizing it  it s meatballs  for crying out loud  why read a review  just enjoy it and have fun  and ignore the trash talk by others  films  like so many other things in life  are subjective  to each his own    always beware the  expert  who diminishes others  taste
