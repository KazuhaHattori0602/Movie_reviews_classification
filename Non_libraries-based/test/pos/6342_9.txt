at first glance of this mini  i was a bit disappointed that tommy lee jones and anjelica huston didn t return to the cast  both john voight and barbara hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary epic western    cherokee jack jackson  haysbert  played an excellent bad guy  and louis gossett jr  was  as always  true to form with his excellent acting skills   the drama that seemed true to life in many scenes  including one of the best  where the valiant shoot out ended with ranger walker being killed made me feel that i was actually in the film  return to lonesome dove was to me  almost up to the quality of the first of the series  the next   follow ups with james garner as call just didn t make it for me  and that lorena marries pea eye  how the heck did that get in their  that was a total mismatch of characters  the first   of the series made the epic story  the next   in no way were of the same quality   now  if the first   could be remastered in dolby digital and an anamorphic presentation  the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today
