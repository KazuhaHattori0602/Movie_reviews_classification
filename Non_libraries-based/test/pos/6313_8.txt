although i totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of toni servillo as titta di girolamo  i would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting  the young director paolo sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of darren aronofsky  requiem for a dream  they both used the same mtv style filming combined with modern  alternative techno  music  making the film   le consequenze dell amore   stand apart from the other crime mafia movies in its genre  even though the movie may start of very slow paced almost  sec  compared to the faster hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity  marvellous character portray and splendid ending  definitely a must see for people who enjoy the european italian cinema  ps toni keep on acting like this we need an encore
