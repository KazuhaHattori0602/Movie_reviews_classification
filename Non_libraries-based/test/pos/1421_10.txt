warning  may contain some minor spoilers   hard to say anything bad about this movie  except for one thing   you don t get to see it much anymore   then again  maybe that s because you have to be home in the morning or at   am to catch it the fox movie channel   too bad  for this is another gem lost to time  clifton webb takes his patented sour  know it all demeanor he had perfected as lynn belvedere  sitting pretty  and sequels  and turns  nature boy   actually  it s like this   webb plays robert jordan the host of a sunday children s educational program that is losing audience share  and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it  or else   part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children   bummer   but as such things happen  the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of boy scouts  and finds a willing victim   ahhhh  volunteer    in the host  so jordan he takes the position   problem solved  right    wrong   this being a movie there are other problems   for example  it turns out one of the scouts is the son of his boss at the tv station  which causes a little friction  especially since the kid is overweight  has asthma as well as an attitude   and he is the more reasonable one   also  there is this cub scout  mike  george winslow  who wants to hang around  being the  stray puppy  type   as it turns out  the reason is that he has no folks of his own  but is cared for by a relative who hasn t much time for him   it is things like this that makes his job harder than expected    all in all  webb becomes more understanding of kids  and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson  and eventually even adopts mike   still a great movie after all these years
