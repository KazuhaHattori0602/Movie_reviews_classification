wow  i just saw this movie on the sundance channel  and it really is bizarre  i may not be a film expert  but it s probably the most bizarre film i  as an average movie fan  have seen   whoever came up with with it had a great imagination  i m a bit of a fan of japanese dramas  and there are often actors from dramas in movies   matsushima nanako  for example  the lead in ringu  is a major j drama star  but it looks like this is the first film for kirie and shuichi s portrayers  i must say  if they really are debuting here  they do a pretty good job   kirie was a very sympathetic character  i thought she was easy to relate with  she was kind and good hearted  perhaps not the most popular girl but nicer than some of the other attention seeking girls  she was also pretty in a classic kind of way  i hope she does more films  but it s been a couple years so maybe she has no such plans   the ending was odd  i m not going to give anything away  but the rest of the movie s bizarreness was kind of put to shame   very bizarre  but very imaginative and unique movie  i d recommend it for japanese horror fans  though i ll warn you  it s a lot more bizarre than ringu   nonetheless  i d give it a   out of   for originality  imagination  good characterization  above average acting  and just being plain intriguing
