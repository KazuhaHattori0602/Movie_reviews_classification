this typical teenagers movie is one of the best  beside the story is good  the music is well accompany the movie all along    although i do not enjoy classic movie unless it is classic and better written script  this one is exceptional  maybe the hair style and language should be change a bit  in the  s i believe offensive language is still rarely heard
