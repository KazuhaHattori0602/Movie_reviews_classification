i first saw this film when released in   from other sources  i ve learnt that the only release of the  minute cut was in new york city  after which it was severely cut to   minutes  so  i guess i saw the shorter version first which  at the time  i thought  was a very interesting anti western  if a trifle confusing   so  it was with even more interest that i finally obtained a dvd of the full length version  i m glad i did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic  and the critical vitriol poured on michael cimino was unwarranted  to say the very least   yes  it s a long movie  but so have been many others  for example  once upon a time in america   at   minutes  cleopatra   at   minutes  the ten commandments   at   minutes  spartacus  restored version    at   minutes  gone with the wind   at   minutes and others  so  it can t be the fact of running time that made so many froth at the mouth way back  when heaven s gate came on the scene   but note this  all of those above movies have everything to do with reinforcing myths about history and heroes   not so heaven s gate  in this narrative  the american west is shown in all its grim and unrelenting harshness  injustice  and poverty  and that s probably the first reason why so many disliked this film  it laid out the circumstances of the johnson county war of   in wyoming  showing how the wyoming stock growers association hired   assassins to hunt down and murder a large group of european immigrants accused of cattle rustling  and all with the assistance and conniving of authorities  right up to the president of the united states  for an essay on that war  with the background and what happened  there is a link at wikipedia under johnson county war   very few like to be reminded of the really dirty periods in their country s history  and which fly in the face of what the country is supposed to be  had it been a documentary  it would have been barely palatable for most  as entertainment  it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn to shreds by the shrill and infamous   leaving aside the socio political diatribe  for a moment  that cimino launched herein  what about the narrative   the story of the three main characters  well  it probably wasn t unusual for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute  just as it s probably not unusual now  it s a fairly standard love triangle whereby ella must choose between the two men  and ultimately decides upon the younger man  nathan  who  although not above resorting to cold blooded murder when it suits him  shows more spirit and commitment than the older james  or jim  as most people in the film say  for some  that part of the story threads too slowly  perhaps  in the context of the wider narrative about the war  however  it is  i think  entirely appropriate   and that war is depicted graphically  viciously and cruelly with scenes of carnage that are exquisitely staged and edited flawlessly   although in the final massacre between the association and the immigrants  i m certain that some scenes of wagons blowing apart are repeated  a minor point and perhaps brought about when the  minute cut was restored  any way you look at it  though  it hits you in the face with the noise  dust  chaos and confusion of war   which brings me to another criticism by others  the noise and dust is such that it s often difficult to hear the dialog and even see clearly what is happening  i ll admit that i found that to be a trifle annoying at first  even backtracking to replay parts to try to catch the image or the words   until i realized that really wasn t necessary if you accept the director s intent  life is chaotic  it is difficult to hear and see in crowded situations and  in war  it s the sine qua non of this mise en scene  in short  it s as though you truly are present in and within the scenes   and what of the title  from shakespeare  it refers to a figurative nearness to god and so  if you equate god with the natural world  the stunning scenery that pervades the movie   and it is stunning  hauntingly equal to that of david lean s doctor zhivago     is a useful metaphor  i tend to think  however  that cimino had something more to say  namely the idea that the brave immigrants   the god fearing salt of the earth   were denied entry to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life for themselves in the land that espouses to be freedom s champion   was that cimino s intent   to gut the myth of the american west  to show how  in america  only the rich get rich while the poor are massacred  one way or another  throughout history  is that anything new  not really  as we all know  where it really hurt  however  is in showing how america was not and  by implication  is not the land of the free and the home of the brave  instead  after absorbing this narrative  we are left with an impression that the underpinnings of america have more to do with a land of dispossessed slaves and a home for knaves
