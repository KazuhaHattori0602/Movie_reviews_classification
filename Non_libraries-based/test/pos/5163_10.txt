a short review without any spoilers follows   i saw this movie yesterday at the cannes film festival  my initial reaction is one of wonder and happiness  i m so happy films like this are being made in our age of blockbusters    roy andersson s new movie  you  the living  is nothing less than a complete masterpiece  you  the living is composed by some   vignettes filmed with a static camera  i will not give away the content of the scenes here  because i hate when people spoil even the smallest details  but  yes  most of the scenes made the   people in the claude debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed  when the film was over we applauded for several minutes  we had no other choice   so what s the score with  you  the living  hm  andersson isn t afraid to take on the heavy questions  history  guilt  gand the holocaust during ww  are big subjects  and these themes work very well together   the images created are brilliant  the depth sometimes surpasses  songs from the second floor    well  sorry for this ranting  praising review  look out for the flying house in the beginning folks     stars   a masterpiece  i never throw this grade out
