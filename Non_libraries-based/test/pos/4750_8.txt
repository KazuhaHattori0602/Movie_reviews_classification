this film is a classic seventies cop flick that for some reason has been sadly overlooked  it is basically french connection meets bullit   roy scheider plays the head of an elite group of detectives  known as the  seven ups    one of their men is discovered during an undercover op and is killed   scheider and his team must find his killers  they become involved in a battle with the mob   the highlight of the film has to be the car chase  obviously included to cash in on the success of bullit  however  this car chase outshines bullitt due to its length  speed and sheer excitement it s a breathtaking roller coaster ride that ends rather unexpectedly and spectacularly  don t miss this little gem
