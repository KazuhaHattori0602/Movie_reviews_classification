my son adam   years old  is a big scooby doo fan  he like this film a lot  he particularly liked when the loch ness monster tried to attack shaggy and scooby  the vote score is his choice and reflects his love of the characters   having seen the  vampire rock  film first  this  not surprisingly  was very similar as they repeat a well worn basic plot in a different setting   few adults will come across this without having their own memories of the tv cartoon series and even fewer will watch it without children  you either like this or love it  i loved scooby doo for half an hour as a kid  i am happy my son loves it  i can just about put up with it now
