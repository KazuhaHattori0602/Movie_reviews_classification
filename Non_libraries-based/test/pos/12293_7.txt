i agree with  johnlewis  who said that there is a lot going on between the lines in this film  while i do think the pacing of this film could be improved  i do think that the complexity of the relationships between the characters is fascinating   examples     pierre is going to marry his cousin  even though his love for her seems very cousin y     pierre and his stepmother have a rather curious relationship   pierre  lucie  and thibault seem to have a triangular relationship  and the actual points to the triangle are not quite certain   lucie s brother is a bit of a eunuch  or is he     and isabelle  who is she really     overall  i think it was worth my time  an interesting film  and one that makes me want to read melville
