the best batman movie of the  s no doubt about it  this movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares   although the villains are somewhat cheesy  they fit perfect for the movie s tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography    the performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations    don t get fooled by the cheesy outfits  this is a movie in the pure style of burton  that can t be described  burton is a sui generis director that took the batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it s comic style past    recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all  if it deals with super heroes
