i hate to admit it  but i didn t find it to be one of hitchcock s best but nonetheless a riveting  climatic thriller  in a remake of hitchock s   movie of the same title  dr  ben mckenna  james stewart    the man who knows too much   and his wife jo mckenna  doris day  are holidaying in morocco with their son hank  christopher oslen  when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot  the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot  kidnapping their beloved hank   i found it surprising that doris day  who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies  was cast in a hitchcock film  as i was watching it  i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcock s other works  example  psycho  and she had singing ability needed to pull off  que sera sera  which she did beautifully  she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry  which helped make the couple believable   in comparison to the great director s other works i believe this isn t as good  but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery  there is also the added bonus of que sera sera  which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day  well directed  well acted  a fine film
