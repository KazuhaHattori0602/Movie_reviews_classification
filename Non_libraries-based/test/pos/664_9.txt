stmd  is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget films i ve seen in quite some time  director jeff smith  who also served as co writer  cinematographer and editor  definitely shows his love of under appreciated  s horror films with this movie  anyone who loves the cheesiness  preposterous situations  wacky and stereotypical characters of  s horror movies will definitely love this very tongue in cheek homage to the past   stmd  definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some  it has all the  excessive violence  and  gratuitous nudity  that is reminiscent of those entertaining  s horror movies we all love  i had a blast watching stmd  from the  s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldn t get enough
