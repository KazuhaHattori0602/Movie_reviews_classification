i was lucky enough to see a test screening of  el padrino  a couple months ago in santa monica  i was blown away  you don t see films like this anymore  in the vein of scosese  chapa deftly tells the tragic story of kilo as he maneuvers the tough streets of la to rise above the ranks to become a drug lord of escobarian proportions  the characters are complex and conflicted  the emotions are real  the action is fast and furious  the stunts are expansive  and tilly is hot  she hasn t looked this good since her  bound  days  i d recommend this to anyone  it s a fantastic homage to the epic action films of the late  s and early  s  and to all the naysayers out there
 watch it again  you obviously had your eyes closed the first time  congrats to all involved in the film  i m counting the days until the sequel is released  anyone have a date on that
