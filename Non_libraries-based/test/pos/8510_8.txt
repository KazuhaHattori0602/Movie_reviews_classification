i m sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of thunderball  yes  that movie s influence is unmistakable  but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the   re make of psycho  while it s true that the opening theme of the twelfth  and connery s last  bond film is one of the worst of the entire series  the film itself still manages to stand on its own  despite many other weaknesses  besides that  even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film   sure  sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed  at least by james bond standards  but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers  james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment  having spent most of recent time teaching  not doing  and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from m that he pay more attention to his health  dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot  besides  this is james bond  remember  this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human  and all of his fans are getting all upset because he s got some gray hairs  when this guy retires at the end of the film  m sends poor `small fawcett   in a hilarious cameo from rowan atkinson  to tell bond that without him  he worries about the safety of the free world  and all of you people can t get over the fact that he s not a sprightly young man anymore  come on  sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could  or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to   the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage  as dr  evil would say  `oh hell  let s just do what we always do
  so there s clearly not much new there  but this is one of the bond films that had the better one liners  there s the amusing scene where bond is asked for a urine sample   `if you could just fill this beaker for me
  `from here  there are a lot of good one liners  but the sexual innuendos aimed at mr  bond are especially prevalent in this installment  but then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain s face  making him scream as if his face were burning off  not a very good attempt at comic relief  especially since this guy had been kicking bond s ass with some sort of super spring device that could cut through pretty much anything  and of course  kim basinger stars in this film as one of the best bond girls of the entire series   it s no secret that never say never again has dated badly  and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects   with the one exception of the flying missiles  which were obviously fake but still impressive for   the colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect  and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie  second only to those damn sharks  evidently  fatima blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks  granted  they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own  in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line  `i have one simple request  and that is to have sharks with frickin  laser beams attached to their heads  and then  of course  there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of the simpsons  and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one liner from james   the domination video game created by largo  the film s villain  is an especially memorable scene  and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series  far to superior to the laughable one in tomorrow never dies  but despite many strengths  the film s weaknesses are left clearer in the audience s mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion  one of the more obvious parts borrowed from thunderball  and inferiorly recreated  never mind the fact that largo revealed some crucial information to bond as he left him in the tower alive  dr  evil s brilliance  once again  `i ll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan  what  the climax of what is expected to be a fast paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere    all in all  never say never again ranks very highly on the james bond scale  and connery s wink at the end of the film  as well as the two closing lines  suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as bond  clearly  this is no longer very likely  so we can only hope
