being featured at the   cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame  this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama    it s about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school  everything s circling around a suicide   shown at the very beginning to some extent   that happens at  pm  the characters are somehow all connected with each other  what moves them is described via short interview sequences  strictly shot in b w  the characters are well written  the acting is intriguing  especially teresa palmer as melody and frank sweet as marcus are discoveries   let s stick to the movies  technique  that s what really impressed me  there rarely are cuts  most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van sants  elephant  some scenes are presented more often than once  but each time from a different point of view  here  character  this surely evokes a slowly developing  but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally  the colours are vibrant  somehow unfitting considering the tough plot   but that s nothing less than a clever contrast  a disturbing  everything s fine thing  the use of lighting is adequate all the time  underlining the characters  actual mood  and finally  there are decent placements of music     somehow itches you from the very beginning  it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter  it rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments  this movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices  there ain t nobody who s not to handle some kind of neurosis  even the depicted minor parts  e g  the teachers  seem to be in some state of disorder  and that is what keeps this movie from being really good  its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones  there is no  friendship  love  smiling  truth  passion  there is  faking  humiliation  despair  sickness and beating up  it s like being hit in the face real hard all the time  but you are numb after the first hour  this flick keeps on hitting you  until it reveals something quite instructive in the end   for being sensitively and superbly acted    for being technically innovative and original    for being unidimensional     makes a solid   out of
