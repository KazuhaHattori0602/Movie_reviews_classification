most of chaplin s most famous films are his full length features  and  i assume most people have at most seen only a few clips of him from his pre feature days when he starred in dozens and dozens of comedy shorts  this is really a shame  as some wonderful shorts are pretty much waiting to be discovered by the world in the  st century   if someone watches this film they have an excellent chance to see some of chaplin s better shorts because chaplin himself chose these three shorts and strung them together with a bit of narration to make this   feature film  this is great for several reasons  first  in chaplin s earliest films from   his character of the little tramp is still in its earliest incarnations or is absent altogether  plus  even when he is there  he was often mean spirited and self centered something very alien from the little tramp we have grown to love  second  because the shorts that were chosen were in great condition  if you watch this film you won t need to worry about watching scratchy film with gaps and lousy musical accompaniment that doesn t fit the action  a common problem   so  for a great look at chaplin s shorts at their finest  give this film a chance  it s sure to provide you some excellent laughs
