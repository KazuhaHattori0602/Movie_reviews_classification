having read so much negative press on this movie over the years  i d always avoided it  but the advent of the cheap public domain dvd encouraged me to finally give it a viewing    unfortunately  it s been transferred from a poor copy  the modern prequel  shot on tinted stock  is blurry and the contrast  non existent  faces are occasionally difficult to make out  having said that  the actual story is entertaining and lou comes across as an accomplished actor  more so than in many of the boys  movies   once the movie switches to the  jack  story  the film switches to  colour  and i use that term loosely  most hues are orange or brown  the greens look particularly bad   dorothy ford as  polly  the giant s maid  was a big plus for me as i enjoyed her in an early  andy hardy  appearance   with so many negative comments put down to the actual quality of the print  i m still happy to give this movie a   it gave me a lot of laughs and that s more than the greater majority of comedies i ve watched over the decades can manage   one to watch if you get the chance
