the mario series is back  and in my opinion  better than ever  galaxy is the most creative mario yet  even more so than super mario   the controls are great  some of the best for the wii  beautiful graphical design as well  the levels are very big  and the good old bosses are back  there is tons to explore in this game  definitely a high level of replay value  i only have   complaints    the story is a little to similar to mario   and   the difficulty isn t very high  though it does require some patience  mario fans  the game you ve been waiting for  casual gamers  this game is more than worth the buy    out of
