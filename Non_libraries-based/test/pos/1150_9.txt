i just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is  just  the memory of this movie right now enchants me  if you want to  see a sweeping epic of a movie  with wonderful actors in vivid  scenery  with great dialogue  reminding you of what early america  could have been like [what the world could have been like back  then] well i highly recommend this movie  especially during a  time of war and conflict in iraq when our american image is not at  all what it used to be this movie takes you back to a time when we  were just starting out  when being an american meant really  picking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going  when  the world was such an untamed and unknown place  well  this  movie has that and more  enjoy
