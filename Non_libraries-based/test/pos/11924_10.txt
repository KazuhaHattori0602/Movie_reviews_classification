i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in   i was   then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush  i am now   and i still love this movie  the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho guy movie  it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen  i only wish that it was available on dvd
