being an israeli jew of naturally sarcastic nature as well as a lover of different and independent cinema  it always gives me pleasure to see a film that takes a view on the holocaust that s sensitive and respectful while also being original and unusual  while i haven t read the book   or  for that matter  heard of its existence prior to watching the film   and therefore cannot  like some other reviewers  comment on how they stack up in comparison  everything is illuminated gave me great pleasure  and i can certainly comment on that   to label everything is illuminated a holocaust film would be to do it great injustice  even though it is undeniably about the holocaust  so would labeling it as a comedy or a travel film  although it s about a journey and is as exceptionally funny as it is moving  everything is illuminated is about jonathan safran foer   played to minimalist perfection by elijah wood  in the most impressive dramatic performance i ve seen him in yet  with a poker face that shows nothing and reveals all   a young american jew  and an obsessive collector of family heirlooms and historical artifacts  who travels to the ukraine on a journey to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the nazis  it s also about alex  his tour guide through the ukraine  and alex s grandfather  what s fascinating about these characters is that in the beginning of the film they look like comic relief to balance out the melancholy nature of wood s character  but both alex and his grandfather go through fascinating changes throughout the film  and turn out to be at least as important as jonathan  in fact  boris leskin s as the grumpy  self declared blind grandfather turns out to be the finest dramatic performance in the film   aside from the surreal nature of the film and the characters  the beautiful mix of original acoustic music and russian folk music  the sensitive cinematography and the chilling contrast between the beauty of the landscapes and the horrors of history  what made everything is illuminated a powerful and moving experience for me was the fact that from alex and his grandfather we get a very different and original viewpoint on this painful subject  several excellent films  such as the grey zone and downfall  have already given us the point of view of the lower rank nazis who are presented as human beings who aren t necessarily fully aware of the moral implications of their actions but are caught up in the reality of the war  everything is illuminated presents a point of view rarely treated before  alex s point of view is that of a young man who was born many years after the war  who sees it as hardly more than cold historical fact  who finds himself having to face up to the horrors his own people   and maybe his own family as well   were capable of  the change in alex s attitude   and his grandfather s   towards jonathan  towards the holocaust  and towards the jewish people in general  makes the film a fascinating and original study in character development   everything is illuminated is a terrific directorial debut for actor liev schreiber  and one of the most original and unique films of   it s a highly recommended viewing experience  especially or anyone interested in the holocaust and world war ii
