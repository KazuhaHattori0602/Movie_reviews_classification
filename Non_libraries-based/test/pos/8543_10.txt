i first saw this movie in papua new guinea in   and have remembered it since  although i have never seen it since that first time   just how easily good people s lives can be destroyed by the pure evil that existed then and still does is a memory that will haunt me forever   the movie is funny and immensely sad at the same time and the role played by anthony quinn is superb   this movie should be in all college studies about man s inhumanity to man
