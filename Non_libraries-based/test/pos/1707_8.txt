tia carrere was the reason i decided to watch this film  as neither the title  nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film   which goes to show  me and everyone  that a dvd shouldn t be judged by it s cover    spoilers  the film felt like it was trundling along  not really going anywhere for the moment   the awkwardness of paul faber  zak orth  around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch  and the fringe on the otherwise attractive kirsten beck  as alexondra lee  being too school girlish to watch  where those really fashionable in    the relationship between vicky mueller  tia carrere  and todd boomer  jason london  was tantalising from the start of though  that first meeting across the lake   magical  what a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron  boomer  with two o s as in moron
  in front of alexondra  a shame really that we as the audience knew who vicky mueller really was   well
 the title did give that away  wouldn t you think   what really surprised me was the acting  especially in the scene where vicky gives todd a metal version of his alter ego  the dog character  in the little white jewellery box  the actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss   point of no return for todd and vicky  a shame really that the film ends with focus on  after getting over todd s fathers harvard drive  his re uniting with his friends  i could envision a whole new film   following vicky to new york   there must be a good art university there that todd could attend   nevertheless  a film that does just what we want hollywood to  entertain us for the duration of the film  did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film  todd s mother is slightly insane  on the phone   his dad doesn t find her attractive  any more  todd s teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa   todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic   daring relationship which  however nice it may be  would realistically be very difficult to maintain  age difference  maturity difference etc  and alexondra   zak do not get together because alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship   her reactions towards the condom  the cheating  zak s advances etc  are all very immature  and often involve running away  and zak himself  the poor guy   is too much of a best friend like a brother guy to pull even alexondra   mind you  good film though  i gave it an   brilliant performance by the actors   who bring the script to life
