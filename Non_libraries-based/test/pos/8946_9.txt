two funeral directors in a welsh village  english humour as opposed to that other stuff from over the atlantic  how could i resist  my wife and i saw it on march the  th for our belated valentines day celebration and both of us enjoyed some good belly laughs  we were going to see another movie later but decided not to because we wanted the experience of this movie to stay with us for the evening   the mortuary scene in the last   minutes of the film is worth the wait  it raises issues rarely talked about in the community  but i know three funeral directors  and the humour is right on the money  highly recommended and congratulations to the writers  without you all the actors  directors and the others havn t a job on any monday
