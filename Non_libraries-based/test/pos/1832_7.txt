i will start by saying i have always been a bonnie hunt fan  she always adds life to any character she plays  and she did a wonderful job in her directorial debut   i have to admit this is a chick flick  but keeping that in mind  it is a wonderful story  it touches on many emotions and elicits all sorts of reactions   this film depicts real life like people with real life like situations   tho i have to exclude the coincidence that is the major part of the film   it s a love story  not just of a man and a woman  but the love of family  friends  and loved ones past   even pets   i really enjoyed it  well worth the rental or the purchase
