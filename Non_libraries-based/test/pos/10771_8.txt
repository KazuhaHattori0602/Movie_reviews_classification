sonny chiba  as everyone knows  is the man  in this film  he portrays mas oyama   a real martial artist who fought over   bulls with his bare hands
and won  interesting guy
look him up  anyway  chiba only kills one bull in the film but it s a memorable scene and as the liner notes say  right up there with the zombie vs  shark scene in zombi  the film also offers up loads of hand to hand combat and a decent plot to boot  though i don t believe all of it is true  this film is the first of the oyama trilogy chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts action  finally  three neat little tidbits  part of the opening theme was used in kill bill volume   oyama himself appears in the opening sequences  and that is because he trained chiba in real life for five years
