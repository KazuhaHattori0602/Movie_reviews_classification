i liked this a lot    the camera angles are cool  it s not all jumpy like a blair witch  and i thought they did a great job with the sound when we see things from kane s point of view  lots of fun  plenty of people were shouting at the screen    kane did a great job with his various psycho emotions  he s a lot less one dimensional than most horror heroes   kane is a lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos  it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations  there are not many twists here  but it is clever and original in it s own way  good  creepy  b movie slasher fare
