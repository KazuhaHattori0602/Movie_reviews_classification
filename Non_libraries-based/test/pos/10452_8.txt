this is one of the best and most under rated teen movies ever made   i saw this growing up and it was  and is one of my favorites  maybe not as popular as  fast times  but just as great   there is a serious side to this movie  as mentioned by other reviewers it starts as a comedy and morphs into a drama about halfway through  that s the beauty of it though and what sets it apart  you get it all  humor not unlike that of  fast times    drama  and a great great soundtrack   i personally think every kid about to enter high school should see this  it would give an idea about the journey their about to embark on  cmon what kid watching this  wouldn t be able to relate to someone in the movie  the fact that it becomes so serious halfway though is also cool and just superbly well done you don t even see it coming  definitely a lot of surprises   spoilers don t read anymore if you don t want to know   great  knee slappping humor who could forget the scene between gary and camilla  i can still hear it oh my big strong burrito  priceless   some of the scenes between gary and karin are hard to watch particularly the final scene of coarse  there are so so many women like karen out there who would have made the exact same choice she did  think about it how many women reject men with hearts of gold like gary  for jerks  i know i ve done it and so have many females i know  this movie will inspire discussion and  despite the countless times i ve seen it  still leaves me filled with admiration for the film makers and performers  everyone will find someone to relate to in this movie or what s more likely more then one person   lastly  the music used is just great a lot of cars  u lots of obscure now  songs from the  s an  s purist s dream   but make no mistake  it is not the music that makes this movie unique  it is the story itself  plain and simple  one of the best of it s kind and a teen movie classic
