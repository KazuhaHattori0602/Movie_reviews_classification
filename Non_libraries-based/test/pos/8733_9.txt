i ve been playing this movie incessantly this month  and i just love it  i was around in the  s  oh dear  so it is nostalgic in one sense  however  it s the funny premise  the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching   dr  winston s reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless   i d be more specific  but don t want to spoil it for anyone  who other than matthau can play a man not entirely on the up and up and yet have us still love him  as for bergman s costumes  i think she looks as dowdy as she s supposed to  i think  she was robbed  the one time that she appears in an evening gown  it doesn t suit her at all  which is too bad  i never liked it when i first saw it on her and i still don t   goldie won an oscar for her role  people thought it was a groundbreaking performance at the time  and yet it s the one performance that i don t love as much as the others  she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability  however  which is important for this role   and i agree   i thought rick lenz was great in it and it s too bad that his movie career didn t take off after this   i hope more people watch this movie   they ll love it
