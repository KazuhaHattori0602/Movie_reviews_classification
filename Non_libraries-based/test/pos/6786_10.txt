i just wanted to say that i am watching national velvet on tv  it is now feb   and i was checking on dates details  etc  surprising to see it was made in   and rooney was   years old whilst liz taylor only   what an accomplished english actress she is   to put some americans contributors right  there are no irish villages in england  ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the english countryside  the scenes shown are supposedly taken on the south coast of england between brighton and arundel  county of sussex  no such scene exists now unfortunately  like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches   so please  all you lovely americans  do not confuse ireland with england  ever  we take great exception to it  like confusing texas with coney island
