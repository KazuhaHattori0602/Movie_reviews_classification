pity the poor reviewer who disliked   didn t understand this wonderful film  what a sad life he must lead   this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i ve ever seen  yet it s not dark or preachy like the  ordinary people  type of film  it is mostly humorous  though not technically a comedy   the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy  perhaps shakespear s  midsummer nights  dream  beautiful  intelligent women abound  with wonderful cinematography and a non insulting screenplay that doesn t miss a beat   i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re run on cable  it s like re reading a favorite  treasured book
