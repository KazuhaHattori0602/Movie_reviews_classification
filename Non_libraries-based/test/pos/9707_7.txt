johnny knoxville has gone insane   in the first jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff   his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme candid camera   but in jackass  number two he s really off his rocker   beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull  or later when he rides a rocket  a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket  and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach  knoxville is a madman  in the first film bam margera and steve o   notorious party animals   were the daring ones  but you know it s pretty bad when you see knoxville enticing them to do a stunt   this is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone  constantly trying to one up each other  it will eventually end in death for one of the cast members   in jackass   steve o nearly loses a leg to a shark  knoxville  as aforementioned  is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket  and so on and so forth  jackass   has already been confirmed owing to the success of   and frankly i can t imagine any stunt out performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film   that s incredible footage  it s almost unbelievable  and i wondered whether it had been faked  but apparently it was   genuine   which is actually kind of frightening  and in terms of extremes jackass   far outdoes its predecessor   it also feels more cinematic than the first film  with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original mtv television show   unfortunately  the boys were given too much freedom here  and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity   i can enjoy the occasional poop gag  but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet  or see steve o take beer up the butt  yes  honestly  gets grating after a while  even the frat boys in the screening i attended   who were enthusiastic when wee man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair   were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film  it s not a matter of getting away with as much as possible   it s a matter of saying   is this even entertaining or funny  many times  sadly  it really isn t   but for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people s faces  there are some brilliant hidden camera bits  wacky director spike jonze  adaptation  dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked  with sagging breasts and no shame  and my personal favorite skit involved knoxville as an irresponsible old man  out for lunch with his grandson  letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people  that s classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an r rating  it s a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff   including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank   with poop jokes along the way   still  there s enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing  and it s really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights
