   the films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre  not until this film had i seen a story of such intense passion and love  and the torture that it can bring  i think when people cry during movies they should be beaten  but i found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live  i suggest every gay male see this film  and if you have a boyfriend  thank him
