from today s point of view it is quite ridiculous to rate this film    or x in the us  the film has a sexual  yet sublime erotic story to tell  but the pictures are rather innocent  throughout the movie you feel and see the spirit of the late  s and early  s in the fashion  the dialogues and the typical experimental cinematography and lighting  and this is exactly the part that makes it worth seeing
