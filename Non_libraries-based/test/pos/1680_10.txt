du rififi chez les hommes rififi  can on the surface be described as a french variation on john huston s seminal heist film  asphalt jungle  the difference between the two films is rififi  pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence  also  the police aren t involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle  in the end rififi  is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle  remarkable noir picture that defines  s french cinema   spartacus  may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist  but in my opinion rififi  was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist  first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late  s to early  s  he got some sort of retribution when rififi  became a success around france and europe  thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same  rififi  is the most important film of dassin s career because it not only restored his name  but also gave him a second chance at making films   jules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions  his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless  builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship  dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir  rififi  marked the end of dassin s period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir pictures   rififi  is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director  jules dassin  a masterpiece in acting  cinematography  directing  editing  and writing  not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on  as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film  masterpieces such as rififi  are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture history   the one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the   minute duration  the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre productions  production  and post production of a film  shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi  is in committing and why very few would do something like it  the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater  close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picture   lack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism  any dialogue or and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create  the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience  now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoer s patience  sustains a level of consistency that never once lets down   maintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection  the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence that s rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films  jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting  getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing  the robbery sequence of rififi  reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tension   many filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes  have been influenced if not inspired by it  one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melville original choice for director of rififi who used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos  and le cercle rouge  another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing  also  quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs  was inspired by this film  other film directors influenced are john woo  michael mann  paul schrader  ringo lam  etc   du rififi chez les hommes  is comparable to bob le flambeur  in many ways  one  jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi  and bob le flambeur  two  each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist  three  bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion  four  each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greats   part of rififi s charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois  jo le suedois  mario farrati  and cesar le milanais  most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal  the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo  jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks  du rififi chez les hommes rififi  became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end
