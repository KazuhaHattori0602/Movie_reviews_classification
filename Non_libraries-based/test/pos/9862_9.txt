after reading some of the earlier nasty remarks  i had to put in my two cents  this show was not  despite what that goon in essex thinks  the worst thing that ever aired on tv  i think most of today s tv is much worse  when is this stupid  reality  fad ever going to end  and there isn t a current show i can stand to watch  gimme the stuff i grew up with  i m a   baby and not ashamed to admit it   this show has been my all time favorite for almost   years  i was in high school when it originally aired and i think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days  i was such a misfit back then  and  fantasy island  appealed to my imagination  as i was a budding writer in those days  it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft  what a wonderful premise  i won t say it didn t have its faults  sometimes the scripts were pretty bad  and some of the problems seemed trivial  but it could be good too  and it was a blast to watch and still is  as for the cheesiness factor  well  i think it s unfair to label every single  s product as cheesy  there was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks   btw  most of the seasons aired in the  s  my favorite episodes came from seasons     and   mostly   to those who disparage herv  villechaize for his heavy french accent and his short stature  grow up and learn something  it s so easy to make fun when you re  normal  and  perfect  that man made the best of what he was dealt in life  and if you don t like it  that s just tough  have a little compassion  he s been dead   years  and how easy it is to cut down someone who can t defend himself  there s just no shame anymore   i love this show  so it looks dated  hate to tell you this  but we didn t have splashy special effects and blu ray discs  we were lucky to have vcrs  live with it  accept it for what it is  and that s just plain fun   escapist tv  describes it perfectly  and that s what it was for me   an escape from my rotten real life  and it s still a lot of fun to watch
