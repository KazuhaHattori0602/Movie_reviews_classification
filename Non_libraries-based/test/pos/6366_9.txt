i would agree with the comments already posted to this site by the previous rater   i first stumbled across this movie back in the  s  when i was employed at a psychiatric hospital  unfortunately  many of the barbs aimed at the psychiatric profession do hit home  i especially enjoyed the ending  where the psychiatrist would speak thru the door to the hospitalized grodin  trust me  its fairly accurate   of course  doors at most psych hospitals are not locked  nor are straightjackets used much these days  and any hospital must be licensed to have a  padded room   but a wonderfully underrated film  and certainly one that is quite amusing   jeff
