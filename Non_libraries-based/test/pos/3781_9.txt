chaplin enters the trenches of wwi in this spirited comedy that never belittles the horrors of war  the rain  the mud  the explosions   all these things are present but chaplin seems strangely oblivious to them all  he s in france for one thing  to fight the germans  something he does with unbelievable success   it almost seems like an extended ego trip for chaplin   a very funny one  at that   until the final minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and everything makes sense   perhaps it s what all soldiers dream of before the go to war
