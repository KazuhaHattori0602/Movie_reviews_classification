in complete contrast to the previous correspondent here  i thought shoppen munich  as it was billed when shown with english subtitles here in london at the german film festival in november   was very funny  very well acted  and excellently scripted   it s quite audacious to design a  minute film that consists exclusively  and relentlessly  of talking heads  but i think ralf westhoff succeeded with wit and  lan  no standard filmic devices of  say  following a character s soul baring pronouncement with some meditative minor seventh chord music and long shot nature cutaways  but when someone said something that revealed their souls   well  we were hustled on by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction  which is  of course  the point  the hurtling tickbox superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites  where everything is down to a quick question and answer   maybe most films are so clich d and stupid that we english are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrived cinema  but i can promise you that at the screening tonight  curzon cinema  sun   nov   the full audience bellowed with laughter most of the way through  so i wasn t the only one guffawing   my girlfriend  who speaks german and has lived in munich  thought it was hilarious  i  who don t speak german and have not been to munich  i think  thought it was hilarious  i d recommend shoppen  munich  to anyone  especially couples  looking for a smart  witty  original  wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation who feel they ve missed out on the happy ever after stuff first time round   nb in the english subtitled showing in london  the subtitles  which were very good  were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture  not inside it  i thought this was a good thing
