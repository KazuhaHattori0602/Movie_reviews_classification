i d honestly give this movie a solid   but i clicked   to try to offset the   pages of imbecilic  unjustified  star reviews  this is an interesting story  all of the acting is good to very good  even ms  diaz  who is totally out of her usual grinning bimbo role here  yet plays it well  the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy  it s a fine morality play and there is  no  reason to explain the origin of the god supernatural being alien whatever that s  running the show  so i m glad the movie doesn t try  it s really irrelevant to the story  which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending    before you decide this movie is terrible  or really  anything under a   read some of the dozens of  star  hated it  reviews that are rife with misspellings  lack of punctuation and capitalization  and juvenile criticisms  maybe the trailer was misleading or something   i didn t see it   but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator   or saw    one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw  how utterly inappropriate and unrelated    seriously  most of these reviews read like you tube comments   according to these  critics  this movie is too confusing yet too predictable  not enough action yet there s too much going on  too smart yet too dumb  explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained  oh   and it s apparently a  waist  sic  of time  do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart  i m afraid these  star kids failed to understand the phrase  altruism coefficient  and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movie s premise  despite adamantly claiming that they  get it  right before explaining how confusing it was  if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding  and enjoying  this movie   i really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie   star forever   see it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral  test  and facing the consequences  it s a good time  in my opinion
