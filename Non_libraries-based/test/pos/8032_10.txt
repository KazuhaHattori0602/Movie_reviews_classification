 s the bourne identity is one of my all time favorite movies  however  many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book s plot   the assignment is the real deal  it s odd that no one on the  bourne identity  threads has mentioned this movie at all   well  i jst did   besides the excellent plot  i personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie i ve ever seen  with the possible exception of the bourne  identity itself   the action is all completely realistic  i especially liked the protagonists  training regimen  which was very inventive   the feel is dark and gritty  there are a few surprising plot twists  the acting is excellent    if you like this genre  i cannot recommend this movie highly enough
