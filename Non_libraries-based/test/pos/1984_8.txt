warning  plot spoiler  the always abnormal movies of david cronenberg certainly are an acquired taste  fans of his earlier films will probably like `existenz  but it definitely isn t one for the squeamish  all of the usual elements are here  a game pod made out of skin  hooked into your back  buckets of blood  a gun made out of bones  and a manic mechanic to name but a few  the result is good in parts  bad in parts  and just plain weird in others  but one thing the film has is undeniable originality    despite the excessive use of
 weirdness it does prove a point  virtual reality games can have a dangerous effect on some people  in the movie  a character shoots someone dead claiming that he was `annoying   assuming that she was still in the game  but it leaves the question as to whether that really happened or if it was an occurrence in this stunningly life like game  `existenz  leads to a conclusion that can be responded to in several ways    despite some extra gadgets and gook  it was simply your classic `it was all a dream
 or was it  twist  it is a smart surprise and answers a few questions  but giving that the entire film was leading up to this moment is a bit disappointing  at only   minutes it could have went on a bit longer too  in a peculiar way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way    jennifer jason leigh appears here in her first big role in quite a while  but her character doesn t have enough qualities to make her jump off the screen or even give her a likeable character  jude law on the other hand  equipped with a curious american accent  is good as your average joe sucked into this abnormal world  we see the film through his perspective   `existenz  is far from flawless but it certainly is a movie experience to remember  there s tonnes of weird characteristics to match the similar styles of david lynch  what next    being consumed by a question mark  it definitely isn t for all tastes but it is rewarding enough to recommend  my imdb rating
