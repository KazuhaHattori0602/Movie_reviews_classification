on the outside  this film is better because of vincent d onofrio  law   order  criminal intent  but this film is equally as good as the   version  in some ways  the   version is better because it s more up to date  a decade as compared to the   years  the actors in this film were great  like terry kinney  mcmanus of hbo s  oz  as james daly and tony shalhoub  usa s monk  and gary sinise  csi ny  obvilubuly  dialogue was changed for contemporary audiences  nut much of the writing remained the same  there were stuff that wasn t in the   version that gave this one a boost in drama and comedy  but in the end  this film was just as great at the   one  character wise  vincent d onofrio playing phil romano was excellent  better that paul sorvino  it s a match up between stacy keach and terry kinney in terms of james  as for george  i would praise shalhoub  and between martin sheen   sinsise as tom  i would say sinise wins
