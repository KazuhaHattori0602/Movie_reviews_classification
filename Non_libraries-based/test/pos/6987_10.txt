i saw  into pitch black  on t v  and so i had to see this  i must say  i was very impressed   not only has david twohy s style improved since he wrote  critters   this film brought to my attention vin diesel  sure  he was there in  into pitch black  but here he was ferocious  scary  and intense  i haven t seen charisma like that since schwarzenegger in the  s   the story is simple enough  but it is the characters that make this film interesting  then there was what happens with the female lead  unexpected  the dark humor helps the film move along  the effects aren t grand  but when riddick fights the alien  it blew all of my complaints out   diesel hasn t done a whole lot since this film that i would care about  but i am eagerly looking forward to the sequel
