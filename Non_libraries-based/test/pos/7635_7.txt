l ossessa  also known as the tormented or the sexorcist  or the ridiculously titled the eerie midnight horror show  is a forgotten exorcist rip off which contains one of the best horror moments i ve ever seen  the scene is when the crucifix comes alive  this great spooky scene is unforgettable and totally effective  great fxs  it s a shame the rest of the movie doesn t maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene   this is one of the most frustrating movies ever  imagine the producers deciding to to make an exorcist copy but while making it  they actually succeed in creating something truly original  a possessed sculpture of crucified man  which is shocking when you think about it  but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired exorcist rip off  had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept  with the characters trying to destroy it  etc  this film would have rocked  but once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture  she never tells anyone from where the demon came from  she  and the script  completely forgets the haunted crucifix  which is stupid   if you like so called  euro cult  movies  the first   minutes deliver unlike any other euro cult movies  but after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas  the remaining   minutes suck  boring  it goes nowhere fast as it tries to emulate  badly  the exorcist  so  watch the first   minutes of l ossessa and enjoy the  s fashions  the sleaze and the amazing statue comes alive to ravish the girl scene but after the first   minutes  press stop and eject  and might as well go clip your toenails
