almost   years before frank marshall brought tears to your eyes with his mesmerizing epic  alive  there already was the legendary mexican exploitation director ren  cardona who used the same drama as an outline for his ambitious film  supervivientes de los andes  the unforgettable fatal flight of fairchild   that crashed in the argentinian andes on october     this terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers  most of them members of a professional rugby team  but   people of them were eventually rescued thanks to their strong will to survive and because they fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow passengers  of course you can t claim that this cheaply made and roughly edited film is better than the famous  s version but i definitely appreciate and respect this film more  after all  an exploitation film demands a lot more input from both cast and crew while the big budgeted marshall film  although intense  feels more like routine money making  the sets and special effects naturally can t compete with  alive  but  supervivientes  delivers an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and creates an even more nightmarish hell of snow  cardona s film is ambitious  surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable mexican productions ever  i am really astonished that cardona s take on this story isn t more exploitative and explicit  the scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and consumed are nevertheless hard to digest  but they only serve to increase the credibility of the catastrophe and to stress the inhuman conditions of the survivors  rather praiseworthy for a vicious director who gained fame with his notoriously bad films like  night of the bloody apes  and the santo series  the unknown young mexican actors do a great job and the musical score is endearing  the story is well known  of course  so the screenplay doesn t offer any unexpected shocks  either by history or previously having seen  alive  you know which kind of dramas these people still have to endure before being rescued and you can only await them  still  this is a good film that shouldn t be bashed like too often is the case
