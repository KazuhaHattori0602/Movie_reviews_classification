the jazz singer is one of a number of films made in the late  s and   about the jewish experience in the united states  other than crossfire  and gentleman s agreement  which dealt with anti semitism they usually had a musical theatre background  these films included the jolson story  jolson sings again  the eddy duchin story  the eddie cantor story the benny goodman story  and margorie morningstar  the leading actors in these  jewish  films were always played by non jews  for example larry parks a non jew played al jolson and gene kelly played noel airman in marjorie morningstar  this casting was probably done to make the jewish theme palpable to a mainly non jewish audience  the jazz singer  is no different  danny thomas was a devout catholic and peggy lee was certainly not jewish although she plays a non practicing jewess in the film  the clue to her background is when she attends the golding s family meal before entering she says  i haven t been to a sader  passover service  since i left home   the film is about a cantor s son who has just left the service after seeing action in korea  his dilemma is whether to become a cantor  a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre  his choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father   however  there is much more to this film than this  this film was made after the rosenberg trial during the mccarthy whitchhunts and the hollywood blacklist  therefore in this film the jews are shown as good loyal citizens and  are quintessentialy american  the synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice  the cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a major league umpire  the synagogue itself dates back to   and george washington is said to have visited  therefore jews are presented as part and parcel of american society  nobody in this film has a eastern european accent  peggy lee appeared in very few feature films  in this film you get to see her sing  lover  and  just one of those things  wonderful  danny thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well  the comedic routines could have been left out  yes  the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing  i enjoyed it very much
