just got into viewing program for the first time recently   the  hour  kidnapping  program  don t know why i didn t sooner  james caan is outstanding and wholly believable in the role as the chief honcho at the featured   vegas complex   so often  programs like this have one or more in the ensemble who are either outright annoying  or seem to have been picked because they must be related to the producer or director   that is certainly not the case with this program  along with caan  all of the primary and supporting cast are engaging attractive  and believable  the guest actors are well chosen    the stories i ve seen are interesting  and the show presents a good view of the city as well   this is an entertaining program  and one i hope will remain  i don t know how i managed to miss it for so long  but plan to tivo it from now on
