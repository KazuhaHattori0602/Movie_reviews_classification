this movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is  it is a movie both for children and parents  and it is  timeless  i saw this movie before ocean s eleven and must admit that the actors in oe has class in advance  but the play of klatret sen is much more down to earth and moving  why i say ocean s eleven  is the fact that these   movies has many things in common and klatret sen is that good   that it can bear comparison with oe  the   youngsters play their part in a perfect way not to believe  compared to what we are used to in denmark  the different cases of impossible acts  is handled in a way that you wouldn t belive from many young actors  and sometimes not even from the  old boys  the story   again it has things in common with ocean s eleven except for the reason of stealing the money and in klatret sen they need to climb up to the strongroom  the part in which the young people has to take care of ida s younger brother  gives a fine element in the movie  try to imagine how to rob a bank with a   year child with a nappy  on your arm    this movie can bear comparison with most  grown up  movie like mi  and ocean s eleven  yes i do believe it is that good  it is best to see it in a theater  as all the children in the room comments the movie and these comments will stay in your hearts forever    regards klavs
