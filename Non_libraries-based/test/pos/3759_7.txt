the  all i have is   dollars and my wedding ring  scene was a riot  i also guffawed at the scene in the bar where hyde snorted the horse radish and flipped the bird to the japanese guy and said  pearl harbor buddy  i think my iq is higher than   but i m not sure because i can t count that high   funny thing  this   line requirement  seems as though they would bash you for making your comments too long  not too short  i hope i don t make it to   words before i get to line    i m still two lines short  pardon me while i think and drink  or drink and think  it depends on whether my hands are faster than my mind  good  i think i ve made it to the   line limit  thanks for reading
