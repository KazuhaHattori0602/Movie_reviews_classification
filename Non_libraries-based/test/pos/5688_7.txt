i d never heard of this aussie horror prior to michael elliott s enthusiastic review  in fact  after having read it  i decided to check if the dvd was available at my local rental outlet and it was  albeit a german edition i e  sans the r  extras  so i opted to check the film out immediately   while i wouldn t go so far as to give it full marks   only a select few titles get them from me  let alone an obscure modern flick   i have to say that i was quite impressed with black water  rather than looking back to previous crocodile movies  such as alligator   and lake placid   it evokes the memory of two which saw a small group of people who go on a trip  get lost and find themselves at the mercy of the elements and the creatures inhabiting the place   namely long weekend   itself a little seen but impressive australian production  and open water    the compact  simply plotted film involves a couple and the woman s younger sister who decide to go fishing in a remote and forbidding part of the australian wilderness  known as crocodile territory  very soon  in fact  before even   minutes have elapsed  their boat is capsized and the guide killed by an alligator   so our luckless adventurers take refuge up a tree  the dvd talk reviewer believes the film suffers from spending too much time in this one location   with the three arguing about what they should do  attempts to retrieve the boat  seeking a way out of the jungle through the trees  only to be met with nothing but water  and the occasional attack by the monster  however  i think the makers take the situation as far as it will go without slipping into tedium  this is due to the palpable suspense and  as michael said  the believability of the characters  particularly the two women 
but also the fact that the crocodile here makes for one of the scariest and most memorable in recent memory  i wonder how they got it to  perform    i also agree with mike that the film contains some really effective shock moments   the alligator leaping out of the water to take a bite at the petrified heroes  its head suddenly emerging in front of the women as they re making for the boat  even though one of them does reach the vehicle  the monster manages to lift its massive weight and get in the boat with her  towards the end  as the same girl manages to find a gun  on the mangled body of their guide  loads it and lies in wait for the alligator to appear  the latter sneaks up from behind her  incidentally  the creature is bestowed with the craftiness of the shark in jaws [ ]  with this in mind  the finale is just as crowd pleasing  though on an obviously smaller scale  as that of the classic spielberg blockbuster   even if it has a downbeat follow up  another definite asset is the film s sparse score   which is generally rather lovely  but becoming unnerving at just the right moments   at the end of the day  black water emerges as a breath of fresh air in the face of the demoralizing slump into which horror cinema has fallen of late  for this reason alone  it deserves greater exposure so as to remind us that there s hope yet for our beloved genre  without the real necessity of resorting to the gimmickry of a cloverfield [ ] to command attention
