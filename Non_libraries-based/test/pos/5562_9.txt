having just borrowing the series one dvd collection from my somewhat obsessive brother  i was expecting to get through the first couple of episodes and handing it back  i have just found myself yelling at the screen for ending the first season on a cliff hanger   a mere week later and i ve watched the entire season  where i found the time for this i have no idea   this show is great  it doesn t take itself too seriously  it has likeable characters who are well acted  and the special effects  ignoring the odd tacky puppet here and there  are  special  enough to give it that polished feel  at first  i didn t realise it was filmed mostly here  and it seemed odd to hear so many aussie accents on a sci fi show   it was most amusing for the main character  john  to land back in sydney midway through the first season   i believe this show s biggest strength is the vision that the creators of the show obviously had  they have gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that have explain previous actions  and the continue to smatter john s conversations with slang in an amusing and unforced way  on top of that  having watched the entire voyager and next gen series  i see little plot rip off   so it has managed to maintain a sense of originality throughout the entire first season  i hope the rest of it is as good   farscape is not like any other sci fi that i ve enjoyed in the past  i heard that the fourth season wasn t as good as the first three  and i am now quite annoyed that they cancelled it before the  th  i hope that they revive this show   with the same actors in either a movie or another series  it would be a shame to leave so many plot lines unfinished as i imagine that with a show that s had so much thought put into it  to have it axed without adequate warning will leave me feeling robbed   gotta go now  heading back to my brother s place to snaffle the  nd season   v
