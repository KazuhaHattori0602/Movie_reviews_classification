i was very impressed with this film from newcomer dir writer jose reyes  the cast was excellent   jorge cordoba  executed a powerful  and shocking performance as the lead character of  rafa  it s inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent    it takes talent  courage  and determination to go out and make a quality film   i admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile    it s easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly  but i applaud  jose reyes    and the talented cast for their successful efforts
