flashes of lightning  a sprawling cemetery  the name of adam  batman  west  all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over  and yet  despite these rather naff elements  one dark night isn t as cheesy as it might first seem   meg tilly  jennifer s sister  plays pretty student julie  who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique the sisters  what julie doesn t realise is that the other  sisters  plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranks or that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of  psychic vampire  raymar  who feeds off the life force of scared young women   admittedly  this isn t the most original of set ups  but thankfully there are enough inventive touches to help set this film apart from the competition  my favourites being the macabre sight of everyday objects embedded in the walls of raymar s apartment  and the creepy manner in which mouldy corpses float through the cold marble corridors of the mausoleum during the excellent finale  hal trussell s impressive steadicam cinematography and tom burman s wonderfully macabre special effects also add immensely to the chilling atmosphere
