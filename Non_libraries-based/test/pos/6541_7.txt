i m guessing that we all  no matter if we are fans of cars  luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road  the noise a   chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and  most of all  the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes  i m not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination  but any of the above really does rev my engine  there s no denying the importance of transport on cinema  it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema  looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time space  but the car remains the most popular and most luved  it s even got its own genre  the carsploitation genre  a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars  in effect  it s just porn  car porn  and i m not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel   in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars  whatever floats your car  i guess  moving on  whilst running on empty isn t quite as pornographic as vanishing point  richard c  sarafian    for instance  with its close ups of the car in motion  all it s bumps and curves   this doesn t mean that the car isn t the main focus of this film  in fact  the cars themselves become characters  more on that later  they re objectified and fetishised as much as the women  in fact  maybe even more  and holy holy  are these cars something  every car in this film  besides the ones in the background  are simply beautiful   works of art  there s no question about it   as i was saying  these incredible cars are  in a way  given characters themselves  you actually start sympathising with the car  spoiler   most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over  this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre  the evil   plymouth fury from christine  john carpenter    satan s custom lincoln mark iii in the car  elliot silverstein    the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job  peter collinson    to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug  robert stevenson    and of course each car from death race    paul bartel    and even wacky races   all of which had their own character  ironically however  this emphasis on the car often over takes   the human characters  and this is certainly the case with running on empty  in which only one human character  the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight  has any sort of dimension  the rest are very much stock characters  these are all your stereotypical australian  s teenagers  big hair  annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours  especially the kylie minouge look a like  but who gives a damn  it s all about the cars racing and crashing  that s it  if you don t like that you really are watching the wrong genre   the car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film  and the best thing it s got going for it  they are fast  very fast  and we re not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car  speeding  at around  mph  and then speed it up  oooh no  not with this film you don t  these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time   no fancy editing tricks here  so  we ve got speed  check  what about crashes  check  check  check  whilst there isn t cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers  john landis      when cars do crash in this film  they certainly crash  it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom they re up in flames  it kind of reminded me of thriller  a cruel picture  bo arne vibenius    in that sense   between these simply awesome scenes  especially the very start and the very end  there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and  in my opinion  fail to add very much to the film  note  more exploding cars needed  however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes   spoiler especially the attempted rape scene   so  all in all  this is a man s film  a boy s film  full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too  i d recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists     it s a great film which you can just switch your brain off  sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume  i ll give it   luvs out of   luvs   bruuuuum  p s   amazon are selling this for just over     it s a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever
