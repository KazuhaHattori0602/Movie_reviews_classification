if you can watch a bond film from   that isn t as good as octopussy and still enjoy it   if you can accept production values which aren t that much above the level of a tv movie   if you can look at sean connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toup e and still see james bond   if you can get past an inexperienced basinger  a weaker largo and a jolly q   if you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score  not up there with barry on his worst day   if you don t believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release   if you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same   yours is never say never again and everything that s in it   and  what is more  you ll probably enjoy it  my son
