i liked this movie   no one i know likes it  but i do   i didn t like it as much as the first one but it was still good  the script and plot may not have changed at all  but the story was better than caddyshack    the only reason i didn t like caddyshack   is   no rodney dangerfield   i think the movie would be better if rodney dangerfield had jackie mason s part  although i did like jackie mason in the movie  it would be alot better if they kept rodney dangerfield   another flaw in the movie  that i didn t hate as much  was dan akroyd  the movie was done   years after the first one  bill murray   carl  could ve quit his job as an assistant greenskeeper and joined the military  you know  if warner bros  had thought of that  it could ve made the movie better  also   this was my comment for caddyshack ii   i give it   out of    it could ve been better  but good nonetheless   if you ve seen caddyshack   and are debating on whether or not to see caddyshack   i say give it a try
