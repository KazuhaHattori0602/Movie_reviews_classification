i saw this film from   recently at our local helsinkian film archive  it seems that the danish film institute has reconstructed it in   to celebrate the  th anniversary of nordisk filmcompany  which was one of the largest in the world in the early  th century  i believe there are several copies with english translations circulating around europe at the moment    i found the film fascinating and the trip to mars well thought out  the plot line is certainly original  but i really don t want to reveal any more of it at the moment  as now the danger of spoiling things for you really exists    the film is also available on dvd  query the danish film institute  det danske filminstitut  web pages at dfi dk with  himmelskibet  to get more info
