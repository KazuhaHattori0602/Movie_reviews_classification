aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water  including the official love interest marguerite moreau   i would have loved to see this movie play out as akasha s power trip  aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen  she does sensual  beautiful and menacing to the power of   watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold   lena olin is cast in the ungrateful role of  the older woman  which is hugely unjustified  she looks fantastic and at    according to the imdb  still looks stunning   the story unfortunately is very limited plot wise  we ve seen it all before  etc   the most heart wrenching is akasha s death scene  especially keeping in mind what happened to aaliyah after filming   all in all  a remarkable vampire movie
