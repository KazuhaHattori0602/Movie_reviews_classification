this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage  i saw  capturing the friedmans  a short while ago and have to admit i thought this was better   the story is not an incredibly shocking one  but it is a great examination of trapped personalities and relational cold war  block deftly guides the viewer through diaries  family footage and after the fact interviews  his interview style is sensitive and probing  and his insights are clear and measured     birch street is a great examination of personalities and relationships over   years of social change  the social fallout  and potential for redemption
