this is more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular but who s complaining  it s always fun to see the poor coyote try various contraptions to get the road runner  and then get pulverized by every one of those inventions   the underground cave chase was different from the normal fare and was clever  it gave us an aerial view of the chase in a maze like structure  i didn t say it was hilarious  just different from the normal above ground antics   this one  along with some other road runner shorts  are featured on the looney tunes golden collection volume   and the transfers of them are spectacular  the colors are magnificent
