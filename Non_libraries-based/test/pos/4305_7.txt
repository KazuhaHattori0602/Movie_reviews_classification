double shock is one of the many good columbo episodes which reaches the level of a good movie   it has all the elements we like in the columbo episodes  we get the laugh when columbo makes something clumsy  and it happens more than once in double shock  i can almost guarantee that you will laugh several times if you decide to watch this episode   we also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder  but something about the murder troubles columbo  the end is the usual  we get the story about how columbo solved the mystery   this is another good columbo episode  and i will rate it   it is close to     just one more question    the acting  peter falk is very good as usual
