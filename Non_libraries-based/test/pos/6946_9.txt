even a decade after  frontline  aired on the abc  near as i can tell   current affairs  programmes are still using the same tricks over and over  time after time   today tonight  and  a current affair  are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism  and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight loss and dodgy tradesmen  shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff pieces  having often been subjected to that entertainment less void between  the simpsons  at   pm and  sale of the century   or  temptation  at   pm  i was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings   fortunately  four rising comedians   rob sitch  jane kennedy  santo cilauro and tom gleisner   were also all too aware of all this  and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly hilarious media satires you ll ever see on television  the four entertainers had already met with comedic success  their previous most memorable television stint being on  the late show  the brilliant saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from   and also featured fellow comedians mick molloy  tony martin  jason stephens and judith lucy    frontline  boasts an ensemble of colourful characters  each with their own distinct and quirky personality  the current affairs show is headed by nicely groomed mike moore  rob sitch  an ambitious  pretentious  dim witted narcissist  mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society   he is always adamant that they  maintain their journalistic integrity    and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that  mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people  occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose  but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion   brooke vandenberg  jane kennedy  is the senior female reporter on the show  she is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile  and  if the rumours are to be believed  she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence  another equally amoral reporter  marty di stasio  is portrayed by tiriel mora  who memorably played inept solicitor dennis denuto in the australian comedy classic   the castle  emma ward  alison whyte  is the line producer on the show  and the single shining beacon of morality on the  frontline  set  then there s the highly amusing weatherman  geoffrey salter  santo cilauro  mike s best friend and confidant  geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with mike s opinion  and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn t get them   for each of the shows three seasons  we are treated to a different ep  executive producer  brian thompson  bruno lawrence  who unfortunately passed away in   runs the programme during season   he has a decent set of morals  and is always civil to his employees  and yet is more than willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings  sam murphy  kevin j  wilson  arrives on set in season   a hard nosed  smooth talking producer who knows exactly how to string mike along  the last episode of the second season  when mike finally gets the better of him  is a classic moment  graeme  prowsey  prowse  steve bisley  ep for the third season  is crude  unpleasant and unashamedly sexist  it s  therefore  remarkable that you eventually come to like him   with its cast of distinctive  exaggerated characters   frontline  has a lot of fun satirising current affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings  many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply  often implementing many plot ideas from recent real life situations  but this never really detracts from the show s topicality ten years on  celebrity cameos come in abundance  with some of the most memorable appearances including pauline hanson  don burke and jon english  watch out for harry shearer s hilarious appearance in the season   episode  changing the face of current affairs  playing larry hadges  an american hired by the network to reform the show   particularly in the third season  i noticed that  frontline  boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour  uncharacteristic for such a light hearted comedy show  genuinely funny moments are born from brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion  murder by a crazed gunman and mike treacherously betraying his best friend s hopes and dreams  only to be told that he is a good friend  the series  final minute   minus an added scene during the credits  which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced   was probably the greatest  blackest ending to a comedy series that i ve yet seen   below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite  frontline  episodes  but  make no mistake  every single half hour is absolutely hilarious and hard hitting satire      the siege   season       give  em enough rope   season       addicted to fame   season       basic instincts   season       add sex and stir   season
