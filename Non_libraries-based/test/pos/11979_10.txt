this movie deserves the   i m giving it   but it s not the   that you d give to movies like  the godfather  or  goodfellas  or  psycho  this is the kind of   you give to a movie which just makes you laugh over and over again  it s the most horribly written and directed movie  yet it doesn t fail to entertain  it has the most amateur effects  yet you enjoy every moment  i saw this movie today on tv  and i didn t want to move away  read the following dialogue to know why    whole college is standing around manisha who has just undergone a rape attempt and the guys who attempted the rape are asking for forgiveness   bad guy   please forgive us    bad guy   yes we won t do it again     no response from manisha    akshay  come on forgive them    manisha  i don t know    akshay  you are a beautiful woman  and even dead men can get aroused by you  and these are living young males  don t blame them   pancholi  yeah manisha    manisha to suniel  what if they tried to rape your girlfriend    suniel  i d break their hands legs and kill them but anyways just forgive them   akshay  yeah if you don t forgive them then it will be as though you are too arrogant about your beauty   now that is a true masterpiece of a dialogue  this movie never fails to entertain  mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations  the bad guy  munish  can do basically anything he can blow a sandstorm from his mouth  or he can get a motorcycle from his backside and just as easily make it disappear again    every actor takes turns to speak one line from akshay then from suniel  then from arshad  then aftab  then nigam  it s the main rule followed by the director  so that equal screen time is given to each guy  and then there s the all powerful pendant  which can cause even a speeding car to go right through you without you being harmed  all these things make it an enjoyable movie  and i can watch it over and over again  i think this movie can go into the comedy hall of fame if there is one   the only problem is that it wasn t trying to be funny
