the beatles had just done  magical mystery tour  there was the general feel that performance  peace and drugs went together naturally  in la  there was a film subculture that knew something was up  nicholson was in several of these gangs   before he decided to seriously become an actor  before  easy rider  before  pink flamingos  before  day for night  there were several experiments with what to do about this  an important one is  saragossa manuscript  this is another   jack writes  he plays with circular narrative  self reference  film reference  performance self loathing  the pain of creation  all on the outskirts of safe kiddiepop  you must see this  if only to know something about jack   certain actors act by digging into themselves  it is a common technique  some dig deep  but after a while  they become boring because they are incredibly shallow people  there isn t just enough stuff in there to sustain a career  think of deniro and hackman   others are pretty interesting people  who seem to become more interesting over time  when they dig into the barrel  they put stuff back in because of the pain of the digging  think sean penn and jack  at the bottom of jack s barrel  at the end of the thread he spins  as the base of every character is this experimental  risky writer filmmaker   who cares if it is a bad movie  it is bad because it took risks  watch when a tear is wiped from annette s cheek by the director  it is a loving goof on the whole brando thing  something that i heard marlon laughed about  that is one of the richest moments in hollywood film history   there s another reason to watch this  music in film is has a strong root in dance  revolution in film often relies on music  whole cultures are thus swept along   an unsung giantess in inventing how billions now dance is toni basil  she was as influential in pop choreography as the beatles were in music  she was already well into her career when called upon to work on this  but this is one of her earliest screen appearances  you can see her work throughout and she herself in the pretty cool  daddy s girl  segment  over one of nilsson s better songs   followed by the frank zappa cameo  mccartney would reference this scene in his teevee special years later   a third reason to watch is early  about     minutes  in the film  a character named  lady pleasure  kisses each monkey in a long continuous shot and then dismissively departs  she is credited as i  j  jefferson but is really mimi manchu  nicholson s lover at the time and lsd partner  red hair  psychedelic demeanor  lovely  that scene says it all for me  about how jack feels about the boys   ted s evaluation     of   worth watching
