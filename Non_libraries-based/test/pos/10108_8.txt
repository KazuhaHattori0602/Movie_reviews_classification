perhaps i m one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of asian shockers is so over hyped  films like  ringu  or the  the eye    which are praised all over the world   simply didn t convince me and they looked more boring than frightening  well  this blunt opinion doesn t go for the south korean gem  a tale of two sisters  this is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terror tale that really gets under your skin  the plot  based on a local folklore tale  might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the all time greatest genre achievements  but the atmosphere and tension building surely provokes feelings of great respect  this is one of those few films that are impossible to label  the events in  two sisters  qualify as mind bending horror as well as intense family drama and a deeply psychological portrait  besides a mesmerizing story   a tale of two sisters  also has all the great elements that i feel are usually missing in asian horror films like compelling music  good acting and innovative camera work  the mansion were the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger lurk behind every door  several sequences  like the dinner with relatives or the nightly appearance in the girls  room  are pretty much the ultimate in eeriness  they really made me feel uncomfortable and i do like to believe that i ve seen my share of spooky horror   a tale of two sisters  is a terrific movie adventure and a definite must see for asian film fanatics  a little warning for people with a short attention span  though  this movie forces you to have your eyes and ears focused at at all time  it s also a film that requires repeated viewing  even though no one will never really  get it  for a full
