i just watched this movie at the santo domingo international film festival  while watching the movie i had the feeling that i have seen a movie with a similar story before a movie with ray liotta but i can t remember much of it  of course  this one is a lot more dramatic  especially at the end   this is the story  emilio s life becomes a lie that he can not longer sustain  after   years lying about his entire life to his wife  son and all the people he knows  the truth is chasing him and there is nowhere to go   watching emilio make up lies is exiting and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing the affair with a young girl was supposed to ad something but it doesn t  despite that the movie is still funny  exiting and involving  either it makes you want to help emilio with his lies or help everybody else catch him  i liked the analogies  photography and the good performances     out of
