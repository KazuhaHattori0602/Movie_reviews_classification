i remember watching this movie many years ago on vhs at a friends place  at first i thought it would be a boring car movie  but much to my surprise it ended up being one of the best movies i can remember watching for its time   it has a good story line and best of all it has some awesome aussie cars and street racing  i really loved fox s car the most which was a worked dodge charger  the paint work which was done on this car was truly outstanding in my opinion    there s also a black two door blown   chev which comes into the movie later on    i actually managed to get a copy of this movie on vhs last year at k mart over here in australia  i did have plans of converting this movie to dvd myself as i believe it is a movie worth the conversion  but much to my surprise this weekend while i was browsing the dvd movie bin i came across it on dvd  so of course i grabbed it while i could as it was the only copy there   anyway if you really want to see some classic street racing with real muscle cars  including a great story line without a rice burner in sight  then this movie is for you   here is some additional info taken from the back of the dvd   he ll win at any cost fox is a young man that lives in the fast lane  he believes he is the fastest man on the road   but street racing is illegal  if he doesn t accept his latest challenge he could loose his girl  if he does accept  he could lose his life  living dangerously  living fast and winning at any cost is their obsession  they don t turn back  the don t give in  and the don t ask for help
