  elisha cuthbert  chad michael murray  brian van holt  paris hilton and jon abrahams  directed by jaume collet serra   yet another classic horror film remade with dunder headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths  based on the   vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures  still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe hooper s   classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade  despite creativity and so so acting the movie was still just a gore picture  director serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching  my final rating
