this american masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be  from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by william wyler from the nonprofessional amputee harold russell
   the film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world
 this intimate engagement with the psychological facts of american life gave it an almost universal audience
 but  unlike contemporary and preceding  message  pictures  it was not a preachment
 it showed americans as they are  presented their problems as they themselves see them  and provided only such solutions partial  temporary  personal as they themselves would accept
 the picture s values are the values of the people in it
  william wyler  an outstanding director  triple winner of the best picture oscar  adds an air of distinction to melodrama  epic and westerns  with his distinguishing visual style and his taste for solemn material  he gained a reputation as a meticulous  serious artist  wyler s most adept use of deep focus reveals the real commitment to emotional content   the film tells the story of three men coming home from war to a small middle american community  and find it variously difficult to pick up where they left off  the three heroes are  a middle aged sergeant  fredric march  magnificent as the devoted family man who succeeds in breaking the ice with his family  an incisive air force captain  dana andrews  returning to an unfaithful wife  and a tormented sailor  harold russell  who has lost both hands in service  replaced by hooks in real life   winner of   academy awards including best picture   the best years of our lives  is eloquent and compassionate  a deeply personal motion picture with touching wordless homecoming scenes      the first words of the sergeant s loving wife when he arrives home unexpectedly   i look terrible  it isn t fair of you to burst in on us like this     the involuntarily sob of the sailor s mother when she first sees her son s mechanical hands  she blurts out   it s nothing   with her dry martini voice  myrna loy combines charmingly her wifely qualities with motherly ones  teresa wright is lovely as the sergeant s nice daughter who falls in love with the pilot  virginia mayo is harsh as the disloyal flashy blonde wife whose first loves are money and high life  and cathy o donnell is wonderful and sensitive as the sailor s fianc e   the situations and even some of the characters seem a little obvious  but this is a superb example of high quality film making in the forties  with smiles and tears cunningly spaced and a film which says what is needed on a vital subject
