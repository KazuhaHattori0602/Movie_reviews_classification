i was lucky enough recently to see ingrid bergman s name attached to a film i had never seen  or even heard of  on amc  what a stroke of luck   to marvel at her flawless and seamless performance isn t the only reason to stay up late and watch this movie  the writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent   walter mathau  not my favorite  was nearly perfect and goldie hawn  suprisingly  was fabulous  tender at times  demanding  then just plain goofy  there are times in the film that even the most hardened film viewer will get caught up in the story and forget that it is a movie   that bergman can steal a dance scene among a crowd of   year olds was amazing to watch  she is effortless in her return to the screen  at age   the supporting cast was great and the lines  the lines are exquisite   a top   romantic comedy of all time
