i found this dvd in the library and based on the jacket notes  it looked like it might possibly be interesting  a black comedy set in   france  just as the germans are marching in   boy  that should have them rolling in the aisles
  but it does  this is a clever  original  suspenseful and funny film  i don t recall seeing anything like it before   foreign or u s  that the writer director can find humor when we know part of the outcome  the germans will occupy france for four years  is remarkable  that he does it with such charm is part of the delight  what starts off as black comedy and fluff even ends up having a couple of serious moments   including a race to spirit out a cache of  heavy water   which was part of the preliminary research for the a bomb  and a quick history   intro to the beginnings of the collaborationist vichy government that would govern southern france for much of the german occupation  but don t let any of that that scare you off  the movie itself is funny  charming and romantic and races ahead at steady clip   one of the best things about it is the combination of actors we ve seen many times  adjani and depardieu  and others we ve never heard of before  along the way  there are two star making turns  virginie leydoyen and gr gori derang re  both are impressive  but mr  derang re is especially so  according to imdb  he was in ten films before this one   but he also won the cesar as  most promising actor  for this role  so apparently he was not all that well known even in france  he is a combination of romantic lead and comic actor   and he makes it all seem so effortless  you may be reminded of cary grant in  bringing up baby  and  arsenic and old lace    it s hard to do comedy on film because the risks are enormous that the actor can come off looking inept  but grant pulled it off charmingly  and this guy does also  i should think we re going to hear more about him in the future   to be sure  this film won t please everyone   there s a little bit of violence  although nothing you don t see on tv every day  but if you re up for something original  you may feel after you ve seen this that you ve unearthed a cinematic gem     the so called  spoiler  in this comment
