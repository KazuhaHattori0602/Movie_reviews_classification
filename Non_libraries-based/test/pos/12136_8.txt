  very good  s movie about mob operations in new jersey  when a  maverick  gangster doesn t play by the rules of the neighborhood  sooner or later  it s time for elimination   joe pesci was true to his character   smooth and funny  he only gets better with age  his face and present day fame should not have been used on the dvd cover to sell this  b  grade movie as he was only the third billed star   dated  s printed wide lapel shirts and lesser quality background music make for a distraction  nice to see the  s big cars    however  the acting is good    nakedness on the part of anne johns was not needed to make this mob story work  and  she does not show up in the database as every acting again in any film other than this one  too bad  she did a good job   moral of the story  don t get your  don  upset with you   if you are wanting to see something different when you wake up in the middle of the night then check out this dvd  it was part of a three movie on one dvd   special at the local discount store
