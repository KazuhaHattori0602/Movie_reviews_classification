i resisted watching   park avenue despite of recommendations  discarding the movie as a clich d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over the top acting   once in a while  movies like   park avenue come by and sweep you off your feet   the movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that  aparna sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie  the impeccable character development   just right  amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all   i have a renewed respect for konkana sen sharma  who convincingly plays the schizophrenic mithi  she beats expectation yet again after page  and mr  mrs iyer  prof  anjali s role is very well developed and shabana does full justice to the character  rahul bose  shefali chaya  waheeda rehman add incredible flavor to the movie   i define  shower moments  as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly  till your wife girlfriend mom bangs at the door   pa delivers many  shower moments  especially the conversation between anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to anjali about her thoughts  it immediately brings out anjali s personality to the audience   the end is a very bold statement by the director  probably too westernized for the indian audience  yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a  good  to a  great  status
