 don t torture a duckling  is one of the coolest italian horror films i ve ever seen  and i ve seen my share  to call it a giallo is a little misleading because it s not really a typical murder mystery  it s more of a straight horror movie   complete with one of the most brutal and gory scenes ever in a movie this old  fulci s twisting and turning film oozes with a creepy ambiance and an old school italian feel  the setting is perfect  an old italian village  the music is ridiculously perfect  the finale is genuine and original   after seeing  don t torture a duckling  you really have to wonder how fulci s later stuff got so off beat  i like all his stuff  but he strayed  maybe he figured he already did it because with this film  he hits the bullseye   i d recommend this film to anyone who thinks that dario argento owns the giallo genre  fulci beats him with this one      out of   kids
