i was delighted to see this gem of a film available on dvd  despite being a  tv movie  and shot on  mm  it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a  london cabbie  along with their foibles and family commitments  even the most hapless of candidates   titanic  with his uncommunicative wife  it was possible to see how jack rosenthal was able to craft an often funny and sometimes tragic snippet of london life into an entertaining   minutes   originally premiered as a vehicle for mick ford  pun intended  the quality of the acting from an ensemble cast including michael elphic  nigel hawthorne  jonathan lynn  lesley joseph and maureen lipman  mrs rosenthal  meant mick may have had top billing  but he had to work hard in the face of such competing talents   even   years after its   release  it is still as fresh as ever
