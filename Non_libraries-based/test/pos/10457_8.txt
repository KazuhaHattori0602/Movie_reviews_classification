feels like an impressionistic film  if there is such a thing   the story is well told  very poetic  the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters  or interpreted by the actors    the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well  unless you hate such emotion in movies   not so in my case   it s a very humanistic film   the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right   well done   a good classic for any good film collection
