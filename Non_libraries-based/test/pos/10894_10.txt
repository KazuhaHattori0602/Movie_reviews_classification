 s goldeneye is one of the best n  releases ever   better than this game  well star wars  rogue squadron  star wars  episode i racer and the legend of zelda  ocarina of time are far better and superior games  but i still love goldeneye   this is the best adaptation from a movie second only to star wars adaptations  the story is perfect  it s like you are in the movie itself   the graphics are excellent  the movements are extremely realistic  the enemies  artificial intelligence are the best part in this game  i loved playing the stage in which james and natalya break from the janus base as the goldeneye prepares to burn it  escaping without sounding an alarm was very difficult  eluding cameras and controlling your fire are great aspects in the gameplay   it s also the toughest game i ve ever played  n  games are usually very  very easy  goldeneye is the one exception  i m still trying to beat the   agent difficult level  but winning the easier levels was already a great victory  i loved when alec trevelyan asked   for england james  i answered   no  for me  it happened just in the moment i blasted him to death  just like in the movie  i love accomplishing every objective   the multiplayer gaming is even better  at first i got killed every holy second  now  i know how to win  i love forcing my playmates by playing at license to kill   the music and sound are astounding  super mario   looks like an atari next to this  the only thing i still wanted to hear was the goldeneye theme song  that plays at the end of the movie   after zelda was released  i nearly forgot i still had this game  it s still excellent  even if it s already surpassed  i hope other   games are produced   fantastic job rareware  nintendo was very smart to release this game on the n  exclusively  magnificent job nintendo
