i love aaron carter but even i expected pop star to be predictable  but i was so wrong  aaron carter was really funny in it and a great actor  also the actress who played jane was a brilliant actress  every one who i no who watched it loved it   the music in it was also really good   the my favourite lines from the film is  you cant send me to a public school mom  im a celebridee  and  take your time  it l come to you   although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do  this film is great  and a proper good chick flick  that i can watch over and over again
