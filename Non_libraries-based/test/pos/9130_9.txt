commissaire mattei andr  bourvil  is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty  that is what the film is all about  and a jewel robbery at the place vendome   corey  delon  brings the plan from prison  vogel volont joins him and helps him against two tough guys  who are after him  because he took mafioso ricos andre eycan  money  while rico already took coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail  corey and vogel find a third man  jansen montand  a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole  a perfect plan and cooperation  but they have to sell the booty and there is mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise  the circle closes  running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving mattei and his little pistol   it took melville   years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for riffifi  melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of france and in paris of yesteryear  the great henri decae is as usual the lighting cameraman  it is the one before last picture of melvilles who died after another film with delon in    melville actually wanted belmondo instead of volont  he didn t like that italian at all  but volont vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to bourvil the most convincing performance  but mind you  melville notes  that volont  is an instinctive actor  a strange character  very wearying and absolutely impossible on a french set  melville didn t like him at all and didn t want to work with him ever again   melville is wrong  volont  give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters  you can see what he is feeling being chased by mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of france in winter   a wild actor   also andr  bourvil  who passed away close to the time of the filming  he also was not first choice  but definitely a great substitute  he carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more   jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot  when he meets delon the first time we already know that the elegant jansen has a severe drinking problem  after the robbery montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to delon  who looks up to him  that he only got into the red circle  because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe  delon doesn t catch what he means  the audience recalls having seen montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him  at that time a very rare scene  one recalls a long time after  i bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making  great artwork when art was made by hand   we sure will remember a crew like the actors  still it seems even after   years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of melville  what is wrong with it  i am afraid one doesn t take much interest in those three actors  showing three criminals  and their police hunter  we learn too little about corey and his fatal   years away from his beautiful girl anna douking  montand is still a great sniper  but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe  delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai  volont  is the man in the trunk of delons american car and superbly moving and mattei is swell to look at  a great actor at the edge of his life  but how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty    in an interview melville states  that there is no woman in the film  not in the very red circle  but i remember well that jolly good looking female anna douking  with no future career  we are in the  s  there in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover delon  bardot did something like that   years earlier  this time melville was directing  well done   the red cercle has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history  the robbery at place vendome and montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and volont  escaping bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream  that is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie  but the   minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level  and there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again  none of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late francois perier is also featured   michael zabel
