a classic late  s film  the superannuated headliners  joan crawford and louis jordan  are not at their best  but the direction  cinematography  and acting of the younger cast are compelling  in a  s sense  which i love   the look and feel of the artsy  over artsy  contemporary film  far from heaven  reflects exactly this sort of film  and i suspect this film may be one of the models  a silly plot  of course  hey  it s   but as a film  glorious  as a reflection of the society  extremely interesting  and as witness to how hollywood breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of american sexual mores  fascinating
