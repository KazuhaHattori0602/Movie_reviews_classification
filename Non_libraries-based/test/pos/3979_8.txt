i for one was very anxious to watch this movie   though i knew it was going to be another type of movie in the style of revenge of the nerds  i was still impressed   there is plenty of truth to the fact of this type of learning and believe very strongly that it should be allowed in a  new style of schooling   conventional teaching methods do not always teach students what they need to know or should know or want to know   this approach to teaching should be further sought out in true academic courses   while there still was too much of the partying scenes  it obviously had to be thrown in there   for hollywood s sake of making a comedy about college even though we all know that life isn t really like that by any means   a touch unbelievable  still funny and with a killer ending   awesome ending  crucial to the entire story and very surprising   without the final scene  the movie would have been half as good   i liked this movie and it didn t have to have overly amounts of swearing or nudity or gross out jokes for it to be good   great crew and cast  story and even the generic typecasting of the obligatory  hampton frat members  was well done   american pie       and american wedding or whatever clones it makes doers not measure up to this by    far better than most comedies about first year college with no demeaning stupid jokes to make somebody throw up with   i liked it  even though it was simple it was interesting and even had heart my only regret for watching this movie is that it wasn t longer
