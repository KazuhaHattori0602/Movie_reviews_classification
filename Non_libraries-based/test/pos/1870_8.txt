i saw this title again on shemaroo  i also asked my nephew who was   to watch the same with me  i am   and he is   he liked it and i did too  it still is funny  a little childish a times but still very clean entertainment  satish shah is hilarious in multiple roles  this sitcom would still fare better than many of the recent serials on tv  but obviously some people obviously like mundane fares that come out today  it would have been nice that shafi inamdar would have continued for all the seasons  he is no longer alive today  i would wish if someone could list all the episodes here   who can forget the lines  yeh kya ho raha hai   what a relief   kaat daalu boss   vyavhaar hai vyavhaar    years ka experience hai   and the title track yeh jo hai zindagi  teaching us to live the life as it comes and take enjoyment out of it  the life of common people   i still like this sitcom  it may not seem as funny at times but certain episodes are still hilarious
