i went to see glenn mcquaid s  i sell the dead  in it s north american premiere at the toronto after dark film festival  seeing as this is the second showing worldwide i didn t quite know what to expect of this film  especially having not seen the short film that inspired this big screen adaptation   i ll start off with a slightly more elaborate plot synopsis  without giving away any spoilers   this movie is about arthur blake  how he became a grave robber and the interesting and supernatural discoveries that both he and his mentor discovered   the costume and set design in this film were excellent  i was amazed to hear that the entire film was shot in and around new york  the costumes were very accurate to the time  really bringing you as a viewer into the mindset of the time  this movie works just as well as a period piece as it does a horror comedy   the interaction between the two leads was very fluid  they played off each others acting with ease  the dialogue between the two was very well written  with glenn adding his comedic touch even in tense situations   the story is very encompassing and the ball gets rolling from the very start  i d compare it to a visual page turner  always wondering just what will happen next  the characters themselves are all very vivid and unique adding different emotional layers to the film itself   all in all  i recommend this film for anyone in the mood for some dark humour  with a bit of horror mixed in
