  when i first heard about this back in   over coffee with friends  i decided to check it out  the only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local cinema s   that didn t stop the enjoyment of seeing a simply great movie  with a top notch cast in aidan quinn  donald sutherland  and ben kingsley  the whole movie  kept me glued to my seat    i simply found no flaws in this great movie  i give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers  i am very proud to have this in my collection       i don t hand this out lightly
