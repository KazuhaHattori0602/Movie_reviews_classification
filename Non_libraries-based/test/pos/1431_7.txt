but quite dated today  otto preminger made this movie without the certificate of approval that was needed then  it was enormously courageous and risky as he could have lost his investment and future   the film is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately hollywoodized   frank sinatra  and i ve never been a fan  playing frankie machine  is astonishing in his performance  one forgets it is frank up there  the level of realism he brings to the role of a jonesing drug addict has to be seen to be believed   kim novak  eternally gorgeous and talented  does not disappoint in the role of the devoted outsider  always there for frankie   supporting roles  particularly a young  handsome and talented darrin mc gavin  are faultless   eleanor parker  playing frankie s wife  is hopelessly inept  she swings from irritating to melodramatic and is far too over the top  a forgettable performance   the stagey  cheap settings are appalling  as if a firm gust of wind would blow the whole tacky painted cardboards over the horizon  almost laughable at times in their tawdry cheapness   the music was irritating  poundingly so at times  as if each nuance of the script  example  when louie is getting frankie his fix out of a drawer  had to be underscored at a high decibel level     out of   sinatra truly deserved his oscar nomination  worth seeing
