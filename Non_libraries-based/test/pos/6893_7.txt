i saw  i smell the dead    sorry   i sell the dead    at a press screening  glenn mcquaid  the film s writer director editor  is a laddish irishman who introduced the screening by announcing that   whilst it was in progress   he would be  going out for a pint  i don t begrudge him a drink  but   by telling us about it   he seemed to feel he needed to certify his laddishness or his irishness  or both  when the opening credits rolled  there were   as usual at press screenings   loud ovations for the names of every actor or crew member who d got friends in the audience  and silence for those who hadn t  mcquaid returned for a witty q a afterwards   this horror movie doesn t take itself seriously  which is good because its humour is considerably stronger than its horror  only one scene is even remotely scary  and most of the  horror  is merely gross out  but i laughed throughout much of the film   this movie appears to be set in ireland circa    by which time grave robbing was mostly defunct  the story is told in flashback  we get flashbacks within flashbacks  and the narrating character flashbacks material that he couldn t know about  because sometimes he wasn t present or  in one case  because the action is unfolding behind his back   the story begins with a prisoner being taken to the guillotine  guillotines weren t used in  th century ireland  but   for once   we actually see a plausible guillotine sequence  the prisoner struggles on his way to execution  the rope cleats are accurate  and the prisoner manages to look up to see the blade overhead   and there s a payoff later to justify the historically inaccurate use of the guillotine itself   the characters are ostensibly irish  but one major character speaks in cockney slang  using phrases like  a mug s game  and  take a butcher s   for  have a look  for once  actors in  th century roles display  th century dental hygiene  yet nearly all the clothes and hairstyles  and the women s make ups  are resolutely  st century  i m not complaining in the case of heather bullock  who wears a very fetching black miniskirt cozzie that appears to be pvc  phworr   the lead actors  except ron perlman  are excellent  but most of the supporting cast have no sense of the victorian period  the worst offender is joel garland as the publican  whose characterisation is firmly rooted in the twenty first century  just when i thought that garland s performance couldn t get any less victorian  he used his fingers to make  ironic  air quotes   the sets  especially angus scrimm s lab  are detailed and impressive  yet failed to convince me that people actually lived and worked in these places  nearly every interior contains burning candles  but never once did i see what would have been there if these were actual victorian homes or workplaces  leftover drippings from previous candles   one scene features an extra terrestrial  i was annoyed that mcquaid plumped for a stereotypical  grey  schwa alien  rather than something original   there are splendid montage sequences  but mcquaid opts for flashy effects   split screens  overhead shots   that don t serve the story  i was impressed by a recurring blue screen device superimposing the main characters  heads over other backgrounds  less effective was a recurring  creepshow style motif of camera shots morphing actors  faces into drawings resembling panel art from  s ec horror comics  i m a fan of ec comics  but they don t belong in  th century ireland  the money that mcquaid spent on flashy photo f x   showing off his editing skills without serving the story   should ve been spent on accurate costumes   big spoilers now  ron perlman gives an  oirish  performance full of acting school tics  ostensibly playing a  th century irish priest  he writes with his left hand   in victorian ireland  left handed children were punished for using  the devil s hand  and were forcibly retrained to become righties  but perlman s character turns out to have a reason for concealing his right hand  elsewhere  a character is bitten by a zombie yet suffers no ill effects  so i knew there d be a payoff later  several scenes that would more logically take place at night are shot in daylight  apparently only because this was easier and less expensive   since mcquaid is a proficient director and editor  he could easily have shot  day for night    but using a process photography effect to help tell the story seems to interest him much less than showing off his flashy editing techniques   mcquaid seems to be giving homage to those great old hammer horror flicks  but those hammers were so great because the actors and production designers worked hard to convince us that we were actually witnessing events in   whitechapel  or wherever   i sell the dead  almost entirely fails to evoke the  th century   glenn mcquaid shows talent as a director  scripter and editor  yet in all three capacities here he makes odd choices   then largely fails to justify those choices  but i enjoyed  i sell the dead  i ll rate it   out of   and i look forward to his next movie
