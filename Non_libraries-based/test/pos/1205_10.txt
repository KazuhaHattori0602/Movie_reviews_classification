now more than ever we need peace   love in this world   this film really showcases the wonderful music of the broadway show  and the fabulous choreography of the legendary twila tharp  i saw it again after many years  and it still holds up well   thank you  mgm ua for putting this on dvd  i love the option of seeing in widescreen  mgm rocks for doing this on many of their dvd releases   ya gotta love treat williams as berger and john savage as claude  they couldn t have picked better actors   actresses for this film  beverly d angelo is such a  hot mama  in this film i had forgotten just how hot  wow   the supporting cast is absolutely great   with the late great nell carter making a singing cameo in a couple of scenes  as well as the kooky charlotte ray  mrs  garrett on  facts of life   the story gets a little weak toward the end  but the anti war sentiment of the late  s still holds up  and is relevant today    it s beautifully filmed  quite a bit on location  and is so colorful and lovely and really brings the spirit of   back on the big screen   i saw this movie when it was released in   when i was   and was moved by it then  and it still moves me now at   some other reviews on here say they think it should have been made sooner i don t think hollywood was ready to make such a movie back in the late  s early  s   the vietnam war ended in   and the whole thing hit a little too close to home  i think for this story to be filmed before it was  like in        bravo to director milos foreman  i love this film   it s nice to see it again  this time on dvd  it never looked better
