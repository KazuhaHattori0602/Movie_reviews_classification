you can t take this movie seriously the plot is predictable and trite  the acting often over the top  the dialog laughable  but it all adds up to great fun  three  career girls  in the late  s find their way to the big city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them about  married men  alcohol  premarital sex  abortion  etc   then there s amanda farrell  joan crawford  who did succeed professionally  but whose personal life has been sacrificed for an office with her name on the door   this movie may have been believable   years ago  but now it s just great campy fun  rent buy it and enjoy
