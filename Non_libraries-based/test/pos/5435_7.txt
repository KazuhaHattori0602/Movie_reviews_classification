  ratings i was positively surprised when i walked out from the movie theater  and yes  i laughed many times  sometimes you just have to let it go and forget all the seriousness see this movie if you like good and clever stand up or politics and you will not be offended by the several references of how things are not good right now  rent it if that doesn t match you
