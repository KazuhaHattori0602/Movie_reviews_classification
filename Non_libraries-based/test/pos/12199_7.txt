once again  there s dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events  in this case  the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet s ecology  although the creature is no e t  he does seem to befriend one youngster  who protects it at all costs  not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger   and badder this   series had a lot going for it  it is family drama  sci fi  thriller with more than a few comedic moments  the characters are believable  well acted and well photographed  the show holds the attention  of course  as with any sci fi show  suspension of disbelief has to be achieved  and i think it is here  alas  the series crashed after season one  so we never get a resolution  infuriating  there is a general comment i feel worth making here  many tv networks and or film distribution companies cancel  quite arbitrarily  seemingly excellent tv series   particularly intelligent sci fi ones  now there may be some very good reasons for this  although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons  this in itself is annoying  what really gets my goat is that  having cancelled the series  they then issue the thing as far as it s got  on dvd  in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible  for previous viewers of the series that s ok  they know what they re in for but 
 many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger  two that come to mind immediately are  surface  and  odyssey   if you ve heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted dvd and end up with an unresolved plot issue   it makes me very angry  i enjoyed  surface  immensely and didn t realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable   and we ll never know what happened next  i believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such dvd issues  to the effect that the story is unfinished  nowadays i check on tv series purchases  imdb is an obvious excellent starting point  to find out whether a  complete  series is really complete or not  buyer beware
