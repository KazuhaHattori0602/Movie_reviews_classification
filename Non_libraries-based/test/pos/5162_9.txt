 with all the misery in the world  how can we not get drunk    mia  a lovely aerial view of a major city turns ominous with the approach of a fleet of airplane bombers  an irate hairdresser reacting to a perceived racial slur cuts a road through a businessman s bushy hair  a man dreams of being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic trick and a teacher breaks down in front of her grade school class because her husband called her a hag  these and about fifty other vignettes that run the gamut from the outright depressing to the wildly humorous to the joyously uplifting populate roy andersson s you  the living  his first feature since his critically acclaimed if commercially unsuccessful songs from the second floor   you  the living is filled with the same kind of imaginative set pieces as songs  replete with black humor  surreal situations  and strange looking characters  though a bit overlong and less focused than his earlier work  what remains constant is andersson s unmistakable style with its stationary camera  sterile looking backgrounds  and precise attention to detail  if there is a theme that ties the sketches together  it is that our time on earth is limited and  tomorrow s another day  so let s treat each other with kindness  along the way  we are entertained by tuba and drum music from the louisiana brass band  dinner guests at a banquet hall standing on their chairs singing a rousing song  and a house that turns into a moving train   the emotions range from the gloom of a daughter attempting to communicate with an alzheimer s patient to a young woman s ecstatic dream about marrying a handsome guitar player named micke to the cheers of a crowd of onlookers  while there is no continuous narrative thread  the theme of greed and desperation appears in several sketches  the first of these threads features two corpulent individuals and their tiny dog sitting on a park bench  the woman bewailing the fact that no one understands or loves her  yet she blithely ignores the man s comforting and reassuring words   there is also a hefty admixture of irony  during what seems to be an executive luncheon  one man tells another on the phone that workers don t appreciate quality and how nice it is to appreciate money and the things that it can buy such as fine wine  when he is not looking  however  a man at an adjacent table calmly lifts his wallet from his jacket on the back of his chair  though andersson s cynicism is at times not very well hidden  you the living has an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition  it is a cautionary tale that looks at the mess we humans have gotten ourselves into but suggests there is still time to turn it around  if we heed the warning of the poet goethe that opens the film   be pleased then  you the living  in your delightfully warmed bed  before lethe s ice cold wave will lick your escaping foot
