when i was a kid i remembered this show but thought that now as an adult the show might be a bit dated  well yes it is but for me that makes the show more retro  and the musics very funky    this show is mostly well written  i do think its a travesty that this show was cancelled after one season especially when this show was more popular than the incredible hulk    i think fans should overlook the poor special effects and enjoy the stories    this next sentence contains spoilers  my favourite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman that battle against each other interestingly a similar idea is concocted in spiderman   the movie  i liked the ideas in this tv show some will hate it  i believe stan lee wasn t a fan
