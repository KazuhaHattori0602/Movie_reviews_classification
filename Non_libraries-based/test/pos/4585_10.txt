i am rating this an   because of the premise of the film  the acting was fine  there wasn t anyone that stood out as amazing or appalling  it is disturbingly true that intelligent people are having less and less children  or choose to have none at all whereas dumb ass  w in   supporters are procreating like rabbits  and  though i don t believe the earth will actually exist in   years  i can see mike judge s parodied prophet coming to be  as life imitating art  the world is being run by idiots  and it will get worse as the intelligent free thinking people become the minority and the  git  er done  fans outnumber them  the proof is our farce of an election   but i digress  if you are fortunate enough to have this playing in your city  go see it  i have paid my   plus popcorn to see far worse rubbish than this  date movie or napoleon dynamite anyone  there are laughs  there are cringes  but overall this is entertaining  if you have half a brain  you will think to yourself how this movie  though funny  is spot on  accurate  and a  tiny  bit uncanny  i m not surprised at all that this movie is almost completely unknown  as fox was the one distributing this  and they wouldn t want any of their sheep to see this and think  maybe i will read a book  and not watch  next  or  cheaters  or  ow my balls  if our society doesn t stop the dumbing down of everything and the bastardisation of the english language  ahem  mr  bush  then this really is where we are going
