the first time i saw this film  i wanted to like it for so many reasons  but i simply did not  it just seemed a little dull  but there was a tiny question i had about something i saw near the beginning of the film so i watched it again
 and then finally it clicked for me  i first watched the movie knowing the  surprise ending  and while i definitely wouldn t recommend having the ending spoiled for you  i have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister scheme   i don t think that everyone will love this movie  or even like it  if you like any of the actors  you ll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time  if you like mysteries  namely hitchcock  you ll like this movie  if you like independent or psychological films  you ll like this movie  it really worked for me on all of those levels  if you don t like the actors  mysterious plots or psychological elements  you might not like this movie  but that s your loss  personally  the only thing that irked me a little was the accents  good try  alan rickman  on the american dialect  but it wasn t much improvement from the scene in die hard   the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though  the medley of accents in the movie was a little odd  but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating  also  the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people  but i actually think it added to the scenes  or scene
 i can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different  but it worked   when you see this movie  see it at least twice  the second time you see it  i hope you realize how intricate the plot really is  every time i watch this movie  it s under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult  i seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering   why did that just happen  or  was that intentional  i like movies that make me think  this one does  so just see it  twice
