 it all depends on how you look at it  we are either halfway to heaven or halfway to hell  says the priest rev  harlan in  northfork  the polish brothers  film is an ambitious one that will make any intelligent viewer to sit up  provided he or she has patience and basic knowledge of christianity  the layers of entertainment the film provide takes a viewer beyond the surreal and absurd imagery that is obvious to a less obvious socio political and theological commentary that ought to provoke a laid back american to reflect on current social values  the film s adoption of the surreal  coffins that emerge from the depths of man made lakes to float and disturb the living  homesteaders who nearly  crucify  their feet to wooden floor of their homes  angels who need multiple glasses to read  etc  and absurd images  of half animals  half toys that are alive  of door bells that make most delicate of musical outputs of a harp  a blind angel who keeps writing unreadable tracts  etc  could make a viewer unfamiliar with the surreal and absurdist traditions in literature and the arts to wonder what the movie is un spooling as entertainment  though european cinema has better credentials in this field  hollywood has indeed made such films in the past  in  cat ballou  lee marvin and his horse leaned against the wall to take a nap  several decades ago   northfork  in one scene of the citizens leaving the town in cars  seemed to pay homage to the row of cars in  citizen kane  taking kane and his wife out of xanadu for a picnic   the film is difficult for the uninitiated or the impatient film goer the most interesting epilogue  one of the finest i can recall  can be heard as a voice over towards the end of the credits  the directors seem to leave the finest moments to those who can stay with film to the end  if you have the patience you will savor the layers of the film if you gulp or swallow what the polish bothers dish out  you will miss out on its many flavors   what is the film all about  at the most obvious layer  a town is being vacated to make way for a dam and hydroelectric project  even cemeteries are being dug up so that the mortal remains of the dead can be moved to higher burial grounds  real estate promoters are hawking the lakeside properties to   people who can evict the townsfolk  of the   only one seems to have a conscience and therefore is able to order chicken broth soup  while others cannot get anything served to them   at the next layer  you have christianity and its interaction on the townsfolk  most are devout christians  but in many lurk the instinct to survive at the expense of true christian principles  exemplified in the priest  many want to adopt children without accepting the responsibilities associated with such actions   at the next layer  you have the world of angels interacting with near angelic humans and with each other  you realize that the world of the unknown angel who keeps a comic book on hercules and dreams of a mother  finds one in an androgynous angel called  flower hercules  while the filmmaker does give clues that flower is an extension of the young angel s delirious imagination  subsequent actions of flower belie this option  you are indeed in the world of angels not gods but the pure in spirit and therefore not in the world of the living  the softer focus of the camera is in evidence in these shots   at another layer the toy plane of irwin becomes a real plane carrying him and his angels to heaven   miles away from norfolk   the final layer is the social commentary the country is divided into two types of people  fords people and chevy people  is there a difference  they think they are different but both are consumerist   to the religious  the film says  pray and you shall receive   words of fr harlan  quoted by angel flower hercules  to the consumerist  the film says  its what we do with our wings that separate us   each of the   evictors also have wings one duck goose feather tucked into their hat bands but their actions are different often far from angelic as suggested by the different reactions to a scratch on a car   the film is certainly not the finest american film but it is definitely a notable path breaking work superb visuals  striking performances  especially nick nolte  and a loaded script offering several levels of entertainment for mature audiences
