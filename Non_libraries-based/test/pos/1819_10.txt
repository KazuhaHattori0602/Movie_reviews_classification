this gem captures early  s life brilliantly  as a grad   boy  myself  i must say that valley girl  along with fast times at  ridgemont high  stands out as the class of the teen sex film  genre  the characters are accurate representatives of the era  the  vapid mall chicks  pseudo punk rebels  preppy jocks are all  represented here   i have seen this over ten times now  the music in the film was top  notch  unfortunately  these tunes could were never as popular in  their era as those by arena cockrockers like journey  styx or  loverboy  before the soundtrack existed  i searched out records  and tapes  it was the  s after all   of josie cotton  sparks   plimsouls and modern english   this movie deserves respect  it isn t just a good  s teen flick  it is  a great film  period
