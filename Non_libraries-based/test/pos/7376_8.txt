i originally posted the first user comment on this movie and claimed it was crap and it didnt make sense i didnt make sense  campfire tales is a thoroughly enjoying film  now that im   years older and watched it last night the actors were famous but not too famous  the acting itself was more than acceptable it was rather good i will rate the movie per segment of films    the black and white scene  a k a the hook  this one was rather pointless it looked good but didnt hold much grip at all the only disappointing one i dont think it was even included as a segment here is the scare o meter    poor    the r v story  honeymooners stuck in woods  possibly the most entertaining of all tales the acting was good in this one too dissapointing bout the typical caravan sex scenes yet it was intruiging you think  who was knocking on that door it had suspense and not too gory liked this one   very good    internet chat tale  little girl meets psycho  this was a smart addition gore left at a minimal frights left at extreme although dull at times the last few minutes were most entertaining dont get me wrong it was still fun to watch real creepy and could happen to anybody so watch who youre talking to    very good    ghost tale  man kisses ghost  not the best it wasnt too atmospheric for a ghost tale this one was strange the aspects were rather good playing music and the screaming but everything was too real to be ghastly although it was good it was quiet bloody and could have been better with that idea    acceptable    the ending  the   lost teenagers  these are the   attractive gals and guys telling the tales through out the film the best thing about the film is definantley the ending it set a great impression the ending was totally un expected watch it it was so well done the realism was spectacular    top notch    the film overall campfire tales was more than i used to take it for i actually like it so much now im buying it on video cause its a truly entertaining horror movie forget the trash you see these days like many im dissapointed that this didnt really go nowhere it was straight to video to me it was better than all the hype  horror  you see these days  overall for campfire tales     very good     out of
