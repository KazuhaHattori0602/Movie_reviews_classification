back in   a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men   i have been waiting for years for a good  old fashioned romance between two men  latter days is all that and more   yes  it is soapy  melodramatic  clich ridden  and quite corny  that is what makes it so wonderful  there is nothing like a good romantic movie  and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word   as to the issue of religion  sorry folks  but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now  it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members  gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection   i loved this movie  it has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance grounded in the reality of the day to day lives of the characters  if i could give it more than ten stars i would  good love stories never go out of style  great love stories like latter days are unforgettable   it s about time
