one of the best film i ever saw   the performance of louis jouvet is fantastic  he really  fill  his part  and this is wonderful  he s such a good actor that you can t think of anyone else to take his part    and both suzy delair and bernard blier are good as standard french people  trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder   the story is breathtaking and well built  you can feel the ambiance of paris for that period  which is about   between two wars  the clubs  the old little buildings  the neighbors   all those things contribute to make a great movie
