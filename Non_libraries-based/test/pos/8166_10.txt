first of all  i d like to say i m just an amateur in commenting movies and that english is not my native language  but that i felt a strong feeling compelling me to write about such movie  possibly as a way to thank and congratulate c  jay cox  the cast and the crew for such a brilliant production   yesterday i watched  latter days  for the first time   at first i thought it might be similar to the movie  priest  which i liked very much for showing a gay priest out of the closet  but  priest  maybe due to its restrict catholic ideological notions  didn t supply my spectator s needs by revealing a profound sad end    latter days  on the other hand  broke that concept  and some other ones as well  such as the mormon s principles  presenting a tender and cheerful story  leading it to a happy and emotive end  and yet arousing a feeling of god s blessing and hope  a great movie indeed   somehow  latter days  made me feel l a  as a city of angels    i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes astoundingly beautiful gay love stories
