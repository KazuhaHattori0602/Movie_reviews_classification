i saw this movie at the locarno film festival in italian speaking part of switzerland   aishwarya rai is good looking   i rate this movie   because of its nice moments     spoilers ahead    it has some really nice cinematic moments in it  specially at the end   though my general feeling is this is too long  over   hours and   minutes  and containing too much dialogs  and nearly no dancing at all   clearly a bollywood movie like lagaan or devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with chokher bali
