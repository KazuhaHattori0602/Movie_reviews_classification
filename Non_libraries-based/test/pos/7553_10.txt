i first encountered arthur penn s  four friends  late one night on hbo  having never heard of it  i expected very little  but watched because i was interested in seeing what a creation by a teaming of penn and screenwriter steve tesich would be like  for the next two hours or so  i sat mesmerized  watching this incredible teaming of talent and the story they wove  a semi autobiographical tale of a young immigrant to america growing up amidst the turbulence of the  s   four friends  follows the story of danilo  an eastern european immigrant  the brilliant craig wasson  from his arrival in the united states through a decade that changed the american landscape  accompanying danilo on his journey are his friends georgia  the radiant jodi thelan  in a role that sadly  she has never had the opportunity to equal  tom  jim metzler  and david  michael huddleston   four friends  covers way too much territory for me to attempt to explain it here  but if you haven t seen this film  i urge you to find a copy  it s just been released on dvd  and watch it  you won t be disappointed  tesich s script is wonderfully poignant   at times funny  at times incredibly sad  but always fascinating and honest  penn directs with a sure hand  and an obvious love for the period and the people whose lives we re following  the cast is uniformly superb  this film should have made a major star out of wasson who is truly one of this country s most wasted talents  jodi thelan  not your standard brainless hollywood sexpot  heats up the screen in a performance that makes the audience fall in love with her character as easily as the characters in the film  metzler and huddleston subtle performances could easily be overlooked in the shadow of their co stars  but they are excellent and help anchor the film  also superb are miklos simon and elizabeth lawrence as danilo s parents  as well as reed birney and lois smith  i have not been without a copy of  four friends  since the day after i first saw it on hbo those many years ago  it has been and remains one of my all time favorite films for more than   years now  i can t recommend it enough and feel  if you give it a chance  you ll feel the same way
