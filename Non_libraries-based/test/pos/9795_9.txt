 radio flyer  is one of my most loved american movies   the really great job of two boys  joe mazzello and elija wood   in spite of terrible performance of t hanks at the beginning and ending  with marvellous script of d m evans and powerful and emotional directing of r donner plus absolutely incredibly peerless music score of h zimmer allowed the  radio flyer  to win one of the first places in my family s rating of movies   it s so pity that that very good movie was underrating by some movie critics   i just can t help waiting to see it on dvd
