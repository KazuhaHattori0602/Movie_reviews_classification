this has no relationship to virtual encounters   so it s not really a sequel  the two videos just share the general concept of people having simulated sex through a virtual reality machine  so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in vc    yeah  right  and expecting a continuation in vc   just be warned  all the actors and actresses are new  but it has the same excellent director  sybil richards   but like vc   you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the envelope of soft core just about as far as it can go   if you have vc   and you liked it  you ll like vc   if you don t have either  but like really good softcore sex  get both
