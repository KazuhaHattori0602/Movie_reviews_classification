i first played this around   or   when i was with my friends i thought the game was really great and loved it   the game is simple on one player mode you go around as james bond and complete missions in different places like an arctic wasteland or a city my favorite was one with a tank on two player mode you and a friend choose from any character you wish and go all out with a fight through out the area you are in you will find ammo and weapons to help from hand guns to rifles to lasers and even your fists work   again with player two mode there are lots of places to go and some to unlock i find this game really fun but also very suspenseful because you never really know where your opponent is and it s surprising to see them behind a door where you are going   this game gets   stars or of   very good go play it sometime
