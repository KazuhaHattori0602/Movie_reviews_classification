this is a very well done film showing the life of international students during their  erasmus year  in barcelona which by the way is one of the most beautiful towns in europe and is an ideal location    the idea itself with all the different languages is great and gives the film an original atmosphere  there are some clich s about the countries but most of them are true  the characters could not better represent their different countries   having experienced  erasmus  on myself during my exchang semester in italy i can say that is movie is incredibly authentic  i had many experiences which were similar to the characters  except i didn t get laid as often  the movie is also quite funny yet not like all those stupid american college movies   finally the movie touches also some important issues like the change from student to work life      i may not be very objective though
