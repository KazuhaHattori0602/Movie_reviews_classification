anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love  this film  taken from ronald  taking sides  harwood  it s a funny  and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two  very  actorly  types  albert finney is sublime as the despotic  shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging  around him  so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre  company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown   tom courtenay is matchless as norman  the  dresser  of the title   whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless   really a must see
