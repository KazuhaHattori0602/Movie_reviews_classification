i don t think i will include any spoilers but if i do  i can cover my butt   the last american virgin  came in a time were such teenage coming of age high school sex romps were the rave  films such as  prepies     hot times    and the popular  porky s     were making mucho money  yet it is the  last american virgin  the one that actually has a more serious plot story amidst the nudity and sexual situations  it is the often told tale of three high school buddies who want to lose their virginity  the go to the wrong places  prostitutes  the dangerous ones  older woman with jealous boyfriend  and the convenient ones  luring their high school female counterparts  the movie has a lot of funny moments  and although the cast did not produce a single major movie star  it is worth remembering for a fantastic  s soundtrack that includes  devo  the cars  journey and others  by today standards is raunchy and might have grabbed a nc  rating  but is a well told story of how sometimes personal fixation can only bring pain while love might be right in front of us  it is a little piece of  s americana and worth having in your movie collection
