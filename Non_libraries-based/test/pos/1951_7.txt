a teenage film about angst  friendship  loyalty and growing up
 but this isn t a happy outing on its part due to the circumstances and life changing dilemmas surrounding the premise  what eventuates is quite numbing  haunting and downright cold  however i was expecting something a little more powerful and effective and while engrossing and unforgettable it didn t entirely stir up much in the way of emotions  the performances are reasonably a mixed bag  but there s a brutal honesty to them all  dennis hopper and especially daniel roebuck are amazing
 crispin glover eccentrically over does it and keanu reeves  dead as wood turn seems to pay off in his custom slacker role  joshua john millar is quite good and so is ione skye  jim metzler chimes in with a short  but highly engaging performance  the story is dramatically confronting  character laced and harrowing in its eventual breakdown where it infuses a gritty and painful punch  j rgen knieper s swirling music score is simmering with anxiety  tension and wonder as the morals and commitments are tested and learnt
