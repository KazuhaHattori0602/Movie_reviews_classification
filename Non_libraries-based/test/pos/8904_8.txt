  but i laughed  a lot   i saw  ast rix et les vikings  at a public screening during the world cup  the sound was lousy  it was too bright to see the screen properly   but i still enjoyed myself immensely  the names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor  smsix  abba  vikea  all not very witty  but in good ast rix tradition  some very good jokes  but also some that not everybody seemed to get   the only thing i didn t like were the voices of ast rix and ob lix  in the german version at least  the voice actors are very well known around here  which was the only reason they were casted  really  they don t fit the characters at all   all in all  a good way to spend some time  and if it s free  like in my case  all the better  and to have a couple of laughs    out of
