for those of you out there who have seen this pic on vhs  i would recommend the dvd  in fact the vhs is utter rubbish  the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen   and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as   the result is that several actors are not on screen at all  and in many drag races  less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen  the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the film   a lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release  they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups  in fact the prospect of a us release caused even more cuts in the film  for example  the americans reputedly did not understand words such as petrol   strides    mike s dad and mum were meant to be hippies  the dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist  but the following scene with the mum was cut  the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil  fluoro lights and filled with plants  you get the picture  the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet  they freaked and the scene was cut  cowards   yes  the film is noted as an australian cult classic  voted   in street machines best   films of all time  narrowly missing out to mad max ll  the latter had over   times the budget of roe  in fact the budget on roe was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars  even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real ho   compare that with smoky and the bandit or blues bros where dozens of cars were wrecked    so there s one real gtho and two fakes  one of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in cobar after the standby gtho crashed into the back of the country boy s truck   that was unscripted  the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck  because the budget was so tight  the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thing   the   chev is absolutely real  the car began as a very plain   door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown   in the film  the motor was a marinised   which made around   bhp  this was reduced to around   for the filming  the car was able to easily to   mph as show in several scenes in the film    just for the record  anyone with   could have picked up all the cars after the film  the ho  the dodge  the   ute  rammer s   chev  the lot  wonder where they are now   sw
