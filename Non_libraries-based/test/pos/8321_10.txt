and quite frankly that just sums it up   it is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal documentory   the animation is almost flawless  i thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake   however some of the model shots didn t look quite that realistic   and i thought that jurrassic park made a better t rex   if this is the type of thing we see on a normal british tv series then i cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies   i give this   stars    and the  making of  video was also great the dinosaur on the skate board was halarious
