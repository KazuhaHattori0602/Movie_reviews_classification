mark blankfield played jekyll and hyde   michael mcguire was the dad   tim thomerson was the plastic surgeon   did you even see this movie  i doubt it   blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill popping doctor on fridays  thomerson has been funny in anything he does  from movies to series to stand up comedy  if i ever find this movie on dvd i will definitely buy it  i recorded this movie off of hbo back in   and have pretty much worn out the tape  one of the funniest takes on the jekyll   hyde theme ever   of course  with all the cocaine references in this movie  it d be panned as being way too politically incorrect today  as would cheech and chong  too bad  because it is funny  funny  funny
