great film from the late  s  says much about corporate corruption at the expense of the common person  so that the powerful can gain gain huge profits and disregard the environment and safety of others   nearly   years later this film is compelling about the power of certain corporate entities that since the films release have gained ten fold in their ability to control  it shows the need for regulation of the public against powerful business interests whose primary goal is profit   jack lemmon is brilliant  while jane fonda and micheal douglas are as equally compelling in their roles  the frivolous  s where damned for much  this film redeems the decade   a film that becomes better after each watching
