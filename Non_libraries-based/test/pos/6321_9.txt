the mystery and its solution was a great noir conceit  i do have some questions though  maybe i wasn t paying enough attention   who killed the neighbor and why  who killed the replacement girl and why   and some minor quibbles  they should have shown the stopoff at the hotel for the switch  not that they should have shown the switch  but they should have shown jim and the girl going in the hotel  jim going to the bathroom  coming out and being told by the bartender that his girlfriend went to the car without him   then  jim getting back in the car and seeing the sleeping woman  and little girl in his back seat   this would have given the viewer a sporting chance at figuring out the solution   i wish i taped it though  i d like to see it again
