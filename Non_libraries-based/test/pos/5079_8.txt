i liked this movie  i saw it to a packed house at the toronto international film festival the day after the gala opener which must have gone over well  the director  gavin hood was supposed to be present for today s screening  but alas his twins were born just hours before  so he had to jet on a flight back    birthings in   hours  was how he joked about it   rendition refers to  extraordinary rendition    a term whereby suspected terrorists in the us can be sent  without the legal consent of their parents nations  to prisons abroad to be questioned and detained   it s fairly predictable   innocent egyptian american man wrongly accused of being a terrorist  goes missing  while en route from south africa to washingon dc  he is sent abroad  while wife at home  reese witherspoon  fights to find him and free him  but what makes this movie special are some nice choices in story telling    a human touch story of what is going on in the locale where a suicide bomb detonated    the humanity of a cia agent trying to understand and be honest with what is really going on  and   the chronology of story telling which makes it a tight  taut tale that moves and jerks at the right moments  ah   relief  and a mix of emotions that swirl around as the story fights for an ending   all around strong acting with meryl streep as a standout vixen
