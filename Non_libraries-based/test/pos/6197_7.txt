if you watch this series you will get an interesting   chapters about a sleeper cell s story and each characters  and more intense with a fbi s infiltrate   nice story  nice characters and performs  but something is wrong  for me  of course  the final is wrong  you wait ten chapters hoping a great final  it doesn t matters if they fulfill its objectives or not  but  well  i think is not enough  its a small final for a big series  also i hoped more definitions about characters stories   but  i repeat  it s and interesting miniseries  if you don t want to wait with large series   chapters  watch it  i give   of
