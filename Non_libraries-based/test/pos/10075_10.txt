watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish  the story is always entertaining  the tension never loosing up  the whole cast is wonderful  the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection  it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance  bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence  for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine   it s sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry  for me it added to the pleasure  it s the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in  probably one of the most under appreciated movie actors of his generation  he s very good in a small role as bracco s pimp  even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold  i can highly recommend this movie
