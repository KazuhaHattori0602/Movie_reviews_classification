 the seven ups  seems like a replay of  the french connection  which was released two years prior  both the late roy scheider and tony lo bianco make appearances  as well as stunt driver bill hickman   but we aren t dealing with french drug baddies  instead  we are dealing with a war against assorted hoods and criminals after a cop is brutally killed by a hoodlum  we get to see unpleasantness and a pre s new york city   i love watching this film because it is exciting to see the action  and it is a reminder of a cooler time  that said  when one compares the car chases  mr  hickman had involvement in the three most compared  this movie  bullitt and the french connection  each chase scene has its own qualities  and this one is simply superb   and i am glad this title has seen the light of day on dvd
