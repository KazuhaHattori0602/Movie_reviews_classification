at one time `buddy cop  movies ruled the box office  it seemed that every summer flocks of beverly hills cop wannabes descended on our nation s theaters  not any more  lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle  the drought has eased a bit recently with the release of showtime  a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre   mitch preston is a dedicated cop  he s not a dirty harry type by any means  he s just incredibly focused professional who s completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties
like  say  a t v  cameraman  mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the clutches of chase renzi  a producer looking for a killer hook for her `reality t v  cop show  she thinks that mitch will give her the `edgy  boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself  enter trey sellars  a patrolman cum actor who s watched way too many police story re runs  of course mitch and trey mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues   we know that mitch and trey are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie  that s the way buddy cop movies are suppose to work  in fact  it has to be said that showtime rarely deviates from the time honored clich s as writ by lethal weapon and tango   cash  there s a high tech mcguffin to get the ball rolling  in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks  there s a slick foreign baddy with an accent of undetermined origin  there are chases  shootouts and explosions  we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it s all going to turn out  you know what  there s nothing wrong with that  yes  we know the well worn bases are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip  not the destination  showtime doesn t strain to be original  instead its energies are funneled into its characters and humorous situations  as a result  showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy   robert de niro is dryly funny as mitch  in the past i ve thought de niro to be a cold and unexpressive actor given horribly to mugging when called upon to do comedy  lately  though  he s grown on me  he seems to be injecting more humanity into his roles  eddie murphy is hilarious as trey  the best way to describe his performance is that trey is what murphy would be if murphy weren t so talented and hadn t hit the big time  rene russo has a droll time playing motor mouthed show biz shark chase renzi  she stalks through the movie chasing high nielson ratings with awe inspiring determination  in her zeal she re vamps mitch s life to make it more camera friendly  she even calls upon t  j  hooker himself  william shatner  to show mitch how be a more `authentic  cop  shatner is funny  playing himself precisely as we expect him to be  loud  oblivious and slightly obnoxious   i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn t disappointed  ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit  today it s doing moderate business at best  that s a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun
