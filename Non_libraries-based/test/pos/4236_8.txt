i would say  bride of chucky  is a  return to greatness  but the series was never really great  very good   was    were throwaways  and i think this  th installment is equal to or even better than the first movie  and it contains the best subtitle tagline   chucky gets lucky  so he does  in the role of jennifer tilly  who thoroughly rejuvenated this series as jeri ryan did for  star trek  voyager  tilly didn t just create a presence  she added much needed humor  back story  drama  tension and a great little sidekick play thing for chucky  and as much as i liked her in the feature  she can t get all the credit  the props  watch the first   minutes for horror homages  the writing  the inside jokes  again  the opening   pinhead  and chucky lines were great  in fact  if  this  were a movie  it would take   sequels just to do it justice  among others  mercifully  chucky and the series has given up on andy the  hide the soul  quest  and just settled for a new way out of his body  he teams up with his ex  tilly  whom he transfers into a  bride  doll and a couple of bonnie   clyde teens  really  heigl  to regain this pendant buried with chucky s human corpse  this is for any chucky fan   s slasher horror fans or even to those who s never seen any of the previous  child s play  films  it s funny  dark  harmless  gory   but not over the top and despite tilly s literal   minutes of screen time  it s always great to see her  after all  you barely see her play poker anymore   side note  of course  i picked up on the superman reference   hackensack  nj
