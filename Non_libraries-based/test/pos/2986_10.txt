a remarkable film  bringing to the surface all sorts of feelings i had when i was much  much younger  i loved it  and the elton john music  i remember seeing in in the movies when i was a kid  and for some reason  limited release  i ve never known anyone else who saw this film when it was released   the dreams it inspired in me from decades ago have never left me  and seeing the film again recently brought it all rushing back  i confess  however  that my kids  in their  s  have not experienced a similar emotional rush  a generational thing   why is it not on dvd
