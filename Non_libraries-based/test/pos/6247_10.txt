 pletely stupid  go find the movie  bully  or even  funny games  if ya want realism and to be creep ed out but this damn thing stuck with me for years one cause chuck connors always was scary two tanya roberts is the best female victim ever three the chick being smothered in plaster still is one of the all time worst killings on film and  th the telekinetic powers thing blew my mind and came totally unexpected not to mention the dummies wax figures puppets etc it should be right there with psycho last house texas chainsaw etc  it s a classic and deservedly so
