sex is comedy  though not driven by a fantastically imaginative plot  concentrates effectively on the relationship between film director and crew during the process of film making  whilst successfully addressing the dynamics of human relationships and more specifically the issues and problems encountered by actors involved in filming sex scenes  director   jeanne  features prominently throughout  for it is she who carries the plot forward  in the place of a narrator  and gives us numerous little pearls of wisdom to think about  she is a social commentator  relating to her assistant and others the problems she finds with her new male lead by way of associating him with a masculine stereotype  their ambiguous relationship typifies something about human nature   the tendency to be fickle  on one hand  the two seem close  when he is not in sight  she claims to hate him  jeanne also addresses his masculine pride perhaps in a feminist take on things   the taboo of what constitutes obscenity  is raised  the content of the sex scenes is not considered obscene but beautiful  because it is fakeness which constitutes obscenity   that is the director s justification  this is  however  doubly ironic  for the film we watch is in itself a construct within a construct   there s more to this film than just relationships  of course  watching this film is not simply a question of analysing it for the sake of drawing out some sort of meaning  one can delight in the natural lighting which pervades the movie  this makes it realistic and believable  a static camera is sometimes used taking in a heavy composition and at times the camera appears shaky like a home movie  if you re looking for something fun to watch on a sunday afternoon that isn t too heavy but still leaves you thinking  this is it
