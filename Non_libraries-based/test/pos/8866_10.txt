 i know i m human  and if you were all these things  then you d just attack me right now  so some of you are still human  this thing doesn t want to show itself  it wants to hide inside an imitation  it ll fight if it has to  but it s vulnerable out in the open  if it takes us over  then it has no more enemies  nobody left to kill it  and then it s won   john carpenter s  the thing  is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made   fast  clever and purely exciting from start to finish  this is how all movies of the genre should be made   taking place in the antarctic in   the movie focuses specifically on a group of american scientists  we are given no introduction to their mission  but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy norwegians appears at their base camp  chasing an escaped dog  the norwegians are killed  and the dog finds its way into the colony  which is when things really start to get crazy   it is soon made quite clear that the  dog  is actually a shape shifting alien organism  which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims   in other words  it begins to eat the americans  and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemies  the pack of scientists  led by macready  kurt russell  begin to fight for their own survival  using wits instead of brawn  if the thing is indeed amongst them  then how are they to go about revealing it  how many things are there  how can the thing be killed   or can it be destroyed at all   the creature s origins in the film are explained easily  thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to earth  and was frozen in the antarctic ice  the thing tried to escape  and was discovered in the ice by the norwegians  who unknowingly released it from its natural prison    the thing  the movie itself  is similar to ridley scott s iconic  alien    many comparisons have been made   the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area  stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one by one  however   the thing    for all practical purposes   came first   based on the famous short story  who goes there  by john w  campbell  jr   writing under pseudonym as don a  stuart  the film was originally adapted as a feature production in   by howard hawks and christian nyby  the result was  the thing from another world  an unarguable classic  but to be fair  it bore little resemblance to the short story  and carpenter s remake does it more justice   the idea of the thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great  and is the most vital link to the short story  in   the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape shifting organism  but thirty one years brought many advances in sfx   creature effects artist rob bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore fest into a startlingly frightening  and realistic  mess of blood and fear  the thing  although never actually taking one specific form  is constantly seen in a morphing stage  and the effects are simply superb  they still pack a punch twenty two years later   ennio morricone s score  nominated for a razzie award at the time  is a bit too electronic and tinny  but nevertheless haunting when used correctly   from the fact that its cast consists entirely of males  to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought provoking and untypical conclusions of all time   the thing    by any standards   is unconventional hollywood at its best  it comes as no surprise that  at the time of its release   the thing  performed poorly in theaters  and  e t    released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien   became the higher grossing picture of the two  by far   in the long run  however   the thing  is superior in almost every conceivable way  spielberg s tale is outdated and flopped during its  th anniversary re release   the thing  on the other hand  has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics   it is one of the most famous non famous movies ever made   carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career   from his amazing  assault on precinct     to the magnificent  halloween    to the disappointing and silly  escape from l a     the thing  remains his very best motion picture  although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most  great movies  lists   the thing  is still one of my favorite horror films  and   upon close inspection   masterfully crafted  it is a daring and ingenious thrill ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling   a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock offs  this one  at the very least  is genuinely unpredictable
