going into this movie i knew two things about it  i knew that it was a real extreme flick  and i knew that it was somewhat artsy  both appeal to me in their own right  but when placed together it can be something truly unique  and this was damn right  without a doubt  unique  like i said above  it is an artsy film  the way they used some intense sound  it reminded me a lot of an aronofsky film  visually i haven t seen anything like it  the cinematography and lighting were done very well  the movie seriously uses visuals and sounds better than anything i ve seen in a while  especially when you consider the experience these young filmmakers had  couple   year olds  you really have to take your hat off to them   the movie isn t easy to describe or even discuss  there isn t an actual story
 you could say it revolves around the right and left side of the brain and how they control your life
i think  it s four segments  or four ideas brought alive through visual and auditory extremes  there is some talking hear and there  but it s mostly a non speaking film   the first segment is the shortest and it revolves a naked body and an eyeball  try and guess what happens
 wrong  the second segment is my favorite  it involves a brother and a sister  who looks a little like sarah silverman  but with bigger boobs  the brother is crazy and the sister is somewhat of a whore  i would say this is the most extreme of all the segments  and the most well made  the gore effects in this one were great  the third segment revolves around a bunch of naked people sexing it up with mother earth  it s probably considered the weakest of the bunch  but still is smart and well made  the fourth segment is probably the strongest of the film and i d also say the deepest  for myself i ll have to view this a couple times to understand what s truly being said  i know that it tackles christianity in a way that would most likely make your mother feint or throw up
 give it a try   subconscious cruelty was recommended to me and i m proud to say this is now in my movie collection  it s extreme  violent  gory  very sexual and surprisingly pretty damn thought provoking  the next line i m about to say has been used in almost every review i ve read for this film   this movie is not for everyone  now ain t that the truth  if you re into extreme films and or you re just a lover of film that wants to see something different
