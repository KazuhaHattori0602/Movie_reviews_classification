i enjoyed this series  but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording mixing   for whatever reason  they ve had to employ an awful lot of what s called adr  where the actors replace the original location sound with a re recording of it in a sound booth   the reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location  or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain   it wouldn t be so bad if the adr was done well  but at times it s just plain distracting  it s not just the adr that s the problem   the sound mix just doesn t match up to the quality of performances and the pictures   i d be curious to know what went wrong
