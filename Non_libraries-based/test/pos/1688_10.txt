when i first saw this movie back in the middle of january   i didn t like it  i thought it was too weird and thought that some parts that the main star  judith light  acted were so unlike her   which of course is true  and then i watched bits of it the next day when it re aired and i felt pretty much the same  then i watched it again two sundays ago  march  th    and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing  i even cried the first   times  but mainly because the actress was actually crying and i am a big fan of hers   it is a very well acted and done tv movie  judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film  i keep watching it over and over  it s a sad movie  but very good   if you have not seen this movie  i definitely recommend it  it s not usually my type of movie  but i did enjoy this one  a
