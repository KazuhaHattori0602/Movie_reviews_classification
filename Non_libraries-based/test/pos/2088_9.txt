i watched   souls  in athens   th international film festival  september   where toshiaki toyoda  the films s director was also present and answered many questions of the audience  this road film is about   fugitives  all very different characters from each other  they decide to stay together travelling with their red van across japan  every time the van stops  we see these   fugitives trying to escape from their past in order to build up a new life or to fulfil a dream  however  no matter how hard they try  it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction   though a very pessimistic film  it is not a dark film  on the contrary  it is full of beautiful pictures  surreal elements and elegant humor  toyoda s heroes cannot escape their  prison  and they face a divine  punishment for their  crimes  they are small pieces of a beautiful painting  where the tower of tokyo depicted as a huge knife turned upside down prevails
