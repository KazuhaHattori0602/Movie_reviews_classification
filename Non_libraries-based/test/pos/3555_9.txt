having reviewed   of the   perry and croft sitcoms  i thought i would get them all done now  dads army  is my all time favourite sitcom  it ain t half hot mum is also a classic as is you rang m lord  i don t regard hi de hi as a classic  but it is still funny   it s about a holiday camp  similar to butlins  but instead of red coats  it s yellow coats  it is ran by jeffery fairbrother  a well meaning man  but has the personality of a sock  the staff include fun entertainment manager ted  his sidekick spike  he ended up being thrown in the swimming pool nearly every episode  yellow coat gladys  careless maid peggy who longed to be a yellow coat and the punch and judy man mr partridge who hates kids  situations occurred mostly round the swimming pool  where someone would be thrown in every episode  with there clothes on of course   not a classic  but still funny  jeffery fairbrother left half way through  so this  a bit like only fools and horses  outstayed its welcome  jimmy perry was actually a red coat at butlins   best episode  peggy s big chance  series   episode
