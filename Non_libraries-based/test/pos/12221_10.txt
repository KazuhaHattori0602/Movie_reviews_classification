i have bought the complete season of surface  watched it in   days  i was so captured by the the plot  theories and basically everything about this show  the actor who plays miles is great  mile s sister  mother and father acted like real life family would  you could connect on so many levels it s fascinating   i find animals are so wonderful  you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child  it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists   am sadden  that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows  i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book   love the show very much  for those who haven t watched surface  if you like sci fi you need to watch this
