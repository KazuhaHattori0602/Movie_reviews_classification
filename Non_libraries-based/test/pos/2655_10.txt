  a space odyssey   is it a sermon  an account of the history of mankind  an exploration of man s futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him  is it about the fragile balance of time and space  a lesson in evolution  or is it just a spectacular effects show  a film kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words      a space odyssey is all of these things  one of the most interpretable films ever created  it s almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film  than it is to actually watch  but it s left open to discussion intentionally  if kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous   classic  ranked   on afi s list of the greatest   films ever made  my personal  st favorite film currently  and nominated for   academy awards  director  original screenplay  art direction  and visual effects which it won for  it would have lost half its fascination  all of its complexity  and a good portion of its cinematic worth  we would only be left with the technical ingenuity  which in itself is worth praising   because every shot is worth taking the time to look  and there is plenty of time    is very elegiac  and also coolly distant  detached  the emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience    begins with mankind s ape ancestors  who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and toolmakers after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home  then  in one of motion picture history s most inspired jump cut edits  as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite  jumping forward a couple thousand years into space  where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon  and next the film following a crew of space traveler s mission as they follow the monolith s signal through space  accompanied by their untrustworthy computer hal  who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew  before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time  in a flurry of drug induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day  to grow old  die  and be reborn a  star child  whew   this pacing and emotional blankness  is also in sharp contrast with the film s most ironic scene  the destruction of hal  as the crew s final explorer shuts the machine down  bathed in the holy aura of red light kubrick has always used as a repeat motif  hal singing a lovely tune  it is a strangely emotional experience  and it s all genius   other notable aspects of kubrick s masterpiece is the memorable voice of hal  a calm  somehow sinister  douglas rain  the minimal use of dialogue  kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film  giving only banal  unhelpful lines to his actors  the most famous being  open the pod bay doors hal  satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music  and that first  awe inspiring shot of earth  slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it  played to the sound of blasting  triumphant horns     shall always remain a mystery  and will forever be a testament to the cinema s strongest point  visuals are more powerful than writing  it s all from one of film history s most legendary and best directors  whose unique vision  was always his own       open the pod bay doors hal  a space odyssey
