in this film  the astronauts sent to explore a newly discovered planet must deal with several dilemmas  and they do so intelligently  the film approaches it s main plot theme in a unique way  and unfolds it gradually  though it can be guessed beforehand   the acting is very good  though sometimes stiff  as some late s acting can be  it can also be somewhat wordy and even melodramatic  especially after the plot theme reveals itself  visually  it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year s   a space odyssey  and that tends to date the movie  some of the actors went on to star in the   tv show  ufo  which is delightfully campy and worth checking out on dvd   despite these small points  the space flight itself is realistic  and considering this was   the scenes inside the cockpit of the spacecraft also had a realistic look   look for some  s s video technology in use  too  one thing  i suspect a love scene has been cut  but i can t prove it  it would have been a distraction anyway   unlike most sci fi films  this film will make you think about the plot  and that s well worth a look  i m pleased to have this film in my video library
