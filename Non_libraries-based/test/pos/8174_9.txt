i have found this epic to be of an astonishing  striking  even heartbreaking beauty  some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative richness  a magnificent dramatic movement and dynamism  the choreography herein is hugely enjoyable  the actors are thoroughly enjoyable  i have been a big fan of crouching tiger 
 as well  but this one was even better  they have kitano s ingenuity in delighting in what is pleasurable  this beauty affirming adventure cinema is an act of courage  when was the suspense so exquisite and genuine  and the art of showing huge crowds  gigantic armies 
  the film has something deeply satisfying  and a steadfast good taste  there is an enormous pleasure in making such a deliberately impressing and clean show 
 it s good beyond words  few  few adventure films  let alone epics  gave me such an uninterrupted delight   fan can be monumental  
is not monumental art but is monumental fun like leone s movies  like some  s epics  also like the hobbits trilogy  it is large sized fun
