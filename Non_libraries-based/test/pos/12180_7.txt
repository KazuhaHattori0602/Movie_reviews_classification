in queen of the damned akasha aaliyah  was more sexy and had a bigger demanding presence  she just caught your eye and attention  now the movie did have faults  like the lack of explaining akasha s past  what i also did not like was the that the movie didn t really explain or show more of what the relationship between lestat and akasha was  or was like akasha s  aaliyah s  role was sort of limited in the movie and she didn t appear until the  nd half of the movie and then to top it off  her akasha s  death came   quickly but i liked how akasha fought back when the ancients tried to kill her  because in the book the last fight between akasha and the ancients was rather boring  they killed akasha in like   secs akasha s head got knocked off in   sec and lestat turned into the biggest punk in the world   aaliyah played akasha very well and stuart was perfect as lestat  they could not have picked a better akasha or lestat   rest in peace aaliyah
