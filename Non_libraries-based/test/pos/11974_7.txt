i would consider myself a fan of dean koontz  having read a number of his novels and liked them all  but unfortunately i never got around to reading watchers so i m left with no choice but to rate this film on it s own merits rather than comparing it to the book that i haven t read  i went into this expecting something awful  and while i didn t exactly get a brilliant horror film  i am lead to believe that it s fans of the book that are rating it down because as a film in it s own right  watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie  the plot obviously takes some influence from predator and begins with an explosion at a research lab  it s not long before a rancher is killed by some strange beast and the boyfriend of the dead man s daughter has picked up an ultra intelligent runaway dog  a secret government agency is soon on the case  as the murders continue  the boy continues to be fascinated by the dog s intelligence  but it somehow ties in with the murders and the agency is soon on his tail too   the script for this film was originally written by paul haggis  who later disowned it  i don t know why   the writing here is nowhere near as ridiculous as his   hit crash  anyway  the main reason this film works is undoubtedly the dog  who aside from being rather cute  is also the best actor in the film  corey haim  hot off the success of the lost boys is the human lead and actually has a rather good chemistry with the dog  although it is a little bit ridiculous seeing him talk to it most of the way through the film  the plot is rather convoluted and as such the film is more than a little bit messy  but the ridiculousness of it all pulls it through during the more awkward moments  michael ironside also appears in the film and does well as the  bad cop  side of the government agents  the monster is  of course  one of the most interesting things about the film and the way it goes around killing people is always entertaining and gory  although unfortunately we don t get to see a lot of it and when we finally do it s rather disappointing   obviously the filmmakers had seen bigfoot and the hendersons  still  this is the sort of film that can be easily enjoyed despite the numerous problems and i d recommend to any undiscerning viewer of eighties horror
