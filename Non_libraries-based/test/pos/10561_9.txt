after watching tipping the velvet by sarah waters i decided to watch fingersmith  the characters were just as good in both performances  though missing rachael stirling in the adaptation of fingersmith   the story line overall was of a good choice  the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing  excellent watch only missing rachael stirling   if you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn t one of the best films to watch    it takes on a different spin from tipping the velvet but just as good    would recommend it to everyone
