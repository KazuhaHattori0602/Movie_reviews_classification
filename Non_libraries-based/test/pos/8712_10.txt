a sparkling movie  bb is a marvel  she s sultry  she is a feminist  she is still very much in love   the movie features paris in the  s  it is wonderful to look at the sites  the cars  ds  and orly   a simple but very enjoyable romantic comedy  the music is horrendous  it almost dissonates  on the other hand it is hilarious  but it is probably the only thing amiss  at least looking at it with  st century eyes   the movie comments on the french manner of treating infidelity  it is that sense modern  a movie like un elephant se trompe enormenent did it in an  s way  but the basic premise stays the the same   thanks to makers for providing bb with this opportunity
