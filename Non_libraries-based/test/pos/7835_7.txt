let s get one thing straight  this gets an   out of   not on a normal scale  but out of the bad movie scale  this is the kind of movie you rent on purpose  where you intentionally walk in knowing that it is a horrendous knockoff and shun d by everyone else    i went in with one promise from the movie  that there will be snakes on a train  and it delivers    the gore itself is really good  and the characters have awesome roles  come on  it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls trafficking drugs  even a electrical engineer getting his pimp on  you get to see some topless nudity  explosions  snakes  gore  and a mexican main lead running around curing his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face  as i mentioned and many others have  the movie pacing is a bit off  but respectable nonetheless    movies like this keep our group tradition of banding together and all chipping in a buck or two to watch masterpieces such as this  there can be no better time spent then coming together to enjoy a good bad movie    it could learn a thing or two from the likes of other such fine flicks as alien lock down or boa vs python  but those are some big shoes to fill    a solid   out of
