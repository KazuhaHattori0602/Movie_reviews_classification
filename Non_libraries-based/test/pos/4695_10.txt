to quote jason connery and mark ryan on one of the many dvd commentaries  that  wobbly music  over the htv logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever i was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour  the individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful  robin of loxley goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in  even though his departure from the programme was unplanned  marian also develops her relationship with both of herne s sons very well   after languishing for many years in tv wasteland  i re encountered the series on sky   in the uk in the mid nineties and was even more impressed that the series seemed even better than i remembered  this is no children s television programme  it deals with witchcraft  treason  rebellion and injustice  and  it manages to do it without showing too much blood  as far as i can recall  you only see a bit of the red stuff in the pilot film  episodes   and   on the dvd set  the dvds are great  containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on series   only  the jason connery robin  and crew commentaries for series   and   the picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing   the idea of freedom is important  freedom prevails  nothing s forgotten  nothing s ever forgotten
