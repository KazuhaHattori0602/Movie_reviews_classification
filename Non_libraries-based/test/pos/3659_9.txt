the opening night for the  south asian international film festival   saiff  in new york was an event a lot of us were waiting for   i would finally get to watch  hari om    i was tired of watching the  promo  on a loop and the lingering taste of the song angel by nitin sawhney in the promo  left me begging to hear the rest of it  i was impressed by the visuals
 and tremendously curious about how the rugged looking auto rickshaw driver would win the hearts of the stunning sophisticated looking french tourist  i remember being rather intrigued by the theme  when i d read a line or two about it in the papers  ages ago  especially so  since i d personally been very fascinated a few years ago  by how flamboyant the rickshaws in jodhpur were  the snow and the crowds outside the theater only set my anxiety rising   once inside the theater  i found that the saiff organizers only presented disaster  i was uncomfortable and embarrassed by how poorly the event was organized and found myself in a difficult spot  trying to explain and offer excuses to my friends  of mixed nationalities  whom i d invited on the vip guest list  i was hoping to prove to them that indian cinema was not always about bollywood
 eventually and finally  the movie began sending some fresh air our way  or so i thought
 hari om 
 started with chaos and noise  autorickshaws honking  traffic and a whole lot of chaos  i found myself smiling as i felt a sense of  home  filling up inside me   thus began the journey of hari om
 an auto rickshaw driver in jaipur   the director couldn t have made a better casting call with this character  from monsoon wedding to hari om   vijay raaz  despite his non hero looks  carries this movie solely on his acting skills and his take on the character  replete with all the nuances of a rickshaw driver in rajasthan  he s a winner all the way  but how and where he learnt to speak english even that fluently  is the question  however  his character portrays beautiful shades of humor and sensitivity  i love his innocent portrayal of a simple guy from a village  who has big aspirations of being famous some day
 and yet knows when to cut away to reality   camille  on the other hand enters the movie wearing clothes that anyone wouldn t dare to wear in a place like that  it s funny however  that no one seems to really care too much about her dressed like that  she looks very very dazzling though  especially in the latter half of the movie  when she changes to indian attire  her relationship with her boyfriend however seems very vague  it probably adds to the touch of reality of certain kinds of relationships   the movie takes us through the most beautiful parts of rajasthan 
 the surprising part is that none of the places have been portrayed anything other than what they really are  you see the dirt  you see the primitive houses
 you see rajasthan exactly the way it is  yet   there s only one adjective that it leaves you with    beautiful   this is the first director who probably knows how to portray india exactly the way it is  with the dirt and the noise and all the negatives that india is attached to  yet making it look like one of the most beautiful places to be in   kudos  to him for that   the only downside of the movie that i could possibly see  is the pace
 i found it rather slow at certain parts   but rest assured that you will never be bored   nitin sawhney s background scores add a classy international  yet very indian flavor to the movie  the song  angel  which plays at a very crucial time in the movie  blends beautifully with the visuals   i ve also heard that besides the main characters  all the other actors are actually just normal people who d never ever faced a camera before  that s commendable considering  most of our so called established actors   still can t portray realistic characters on screen   all in all  watching this movie was a beautiful experience   it is a pot pourri of emotions  it s got romance  humour
 realism
 beautiful visuals and locations    great music  a great cast   a package deal  when i walked out of the theater   i felt proud to be indian
 a few days later  i asked one of my bulgarian friends who had watched the movie with me  if he d want to watch another indian movie   and his response was     is it better than hari om  if it is  then i ll go
 if not  i think i ll pass  from now on  hari om will be the benchmark for every indian movie that i see  mr  bala  are you reading
