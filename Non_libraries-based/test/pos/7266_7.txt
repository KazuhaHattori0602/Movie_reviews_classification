a very watchable film  and one which was eagerly awaited having seen the trailer a number of times   the whole thing looks superb  from the ludicrous efforts of the effete upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity  to the lower class scum just trying to keep their heads above the filth  the film captures the spirit of the  th century brilliantly   jonny lee miller plays maclean extremely well  though the part does not exactly stretch him  and robert carlyle seems a little wasted on plunkett  miller s highwayman colleague   the real star of the show was undoubtedly ken stott  who plays mr chance  a kind of  s chief of police  with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast   a great film  and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter greenaway s films will love the look of this  although the thinness of the plot becomes apparent before the   hours are up   well worth a viewing
