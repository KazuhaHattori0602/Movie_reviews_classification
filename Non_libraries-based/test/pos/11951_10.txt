i seem to notice that a lot of people have never seen this movie  and those that have usually dismiss it as garbage  that s pretty bad really   the first time i saw this movie  i admittedly was almost one of those people  thank god i m patient  otherwise i would have never found such a classic   as goofy as this movie is  it s also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of  s movies  or just happens to have a sense of humor   i know that there are a lot of people out there that will tell you that this movie is sort of derivative of better off dead  so what if it is  they were both excellent movies   i can honestly say that savage steve holland is a genius
