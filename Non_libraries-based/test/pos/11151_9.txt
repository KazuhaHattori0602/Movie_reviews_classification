from a bare description of the toll gate s major plot elements  one might think it s a revisionist western of the  s or  s      our hero is a robber  killer  and arsonist      the love interest is a single mother whose shiftless husband abandoned her and their child      twice our criminal hero is  unofficially  released by authorities in return for some good deed  and this is presented as a praiseworthy act     the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of one s family and the betrayal of a criminal associate     the hero tries to go straight  but turns back to a life of crime after he can t get a job     the hero is on the run from both a sheriff s posse and a criminal gang     the hero s final redemption is accomplished by strangling a man with his bare hands and tossing his body over a cliff     and the  good bad man  ends the film by sending the young mother and her child back to civilization and riding off alone into the mexican desert  never  presumably  to pay for his life of crime   just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun   of course  the toll gate doesn t display quite the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors  the hero s redemption is set up when he surrenders to the posse after reading a passage from the bible  can t quite imagine clint eastwood doing that   the toll gate an excellent movie by any standard  and hart was a very fine actor  not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion in the days before sound
