what s the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season  here is my forecast    the hatch was indeed blown  but somehow everybody inside survived  buts lets see about that    the episode at the end with the tent is an observation team monitoring the tracking device installed on desmonds boat by penny  now that the magnetic shield around the island was lifted  the signal was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission    after the destruction of the hatch  the island is not isolated any more  and other ships airplanes are going to arrive   the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor observers  was it actually confirmed that there are going to be   seasons of lost   cheers mike
