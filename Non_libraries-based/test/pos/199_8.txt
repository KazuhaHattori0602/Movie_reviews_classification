while watching this film recently  i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in  and in the ussr  that makes it all the more remarkable  many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in   but they were quite original in   i first saw this film in   when it was first released in the us  and i was struck by its originality then  now just having seen it   years later  i have no reason to change my mind
