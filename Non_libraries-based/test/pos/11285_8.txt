begotten the magic the terror the slight boredom   that  begotten  is for acquired tastes goes without saying you don t just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art house movie buffs you must dig the weird the macabre the bizarre you must dig cool flicks and you must dig to find diamonds    begotten  is one of the most visually dazzling and mystifying films ever known to man the visual part is something to behold something no one can prepare you for but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue the visual part is pretty much the only part begotten  is a visual film the soundscapes created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still the sight of it   god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who impregnates herself with god s semen and gives birth to flesh on bone a retarded child she then abandons him and he gets tortured by heathen like creatures mother comes back  to save him  but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures   the film is about the meaninglessness of life and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die and that when something dies something else is born etc nihilism   the film s no  quality is of course the visuals the setting those haunting images this other worldly quality after you re done watching you feel like an alien it s that mesmerizing   when people say it should last   instead of   they re right no they re not it could last  it s just that everything happens to such a slow pace in fact the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film like no kidding still it s i don t know glorious     like a flame burning away the darkness
