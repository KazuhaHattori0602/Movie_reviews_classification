i watched this on tv in   and regretted not taping it  i was very intriguing and suspenseful  it is amazing as the events unfold and this man s past catches up with him   the acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims   twist of fate  but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie
