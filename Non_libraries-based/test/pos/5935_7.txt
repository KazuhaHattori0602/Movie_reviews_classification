a respectable royal rumble event    edge vs shawn michaels    a very strong opener edge s heel performance was sublime as it was during the rumble event  overall id say edges night     undertaker vs heidenreich casket match    a lot of people hated this rivalry though i liked it  i thought heidenreich really played his character well  the match wasn t amazing in excitement that was until kane and snitcky get involved  it gets better as it goes on     kurt angle vs big show vs jbl wwe champ  wwe title match    a surprisingly good match   as there was only   really exciting in ringer in it  angle of course very good title match  good pace  though a predictable end  but aren t all royal rumble title matches predictable     triple h  world title  vs randy orton world title match    actually not that good for the guys involved  went on too many dry patches  orton sold his concussion amazingly  ending though was some what of an anti climax     royal rumble event  btw during the other matches there were a few segments two which were really cool  cena rapping on christian and guerrero stealing flairs number   entry ticket  the event was good   would have got a   if cena won but unfortunately my biggest enemy batista wins though i understood why   vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena crack up in laughter
