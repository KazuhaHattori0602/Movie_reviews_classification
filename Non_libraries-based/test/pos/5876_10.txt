since there have been so many reviews of this fine film i will write in a list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed     dana andrews was   during the filming of this movie  his character according to the screenplay was in his mid  s  andrews  a highly underrated actor  did brilliantly play a character who was supposed to be much younger      fredric march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over the top acting  he was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror      dana andrews was superb as he was in  laura   the ox bowl incident   a walk in the sun   the purple heart  and many other films  why did fredric march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance      harold russell gave the best performance i have ever seen by a non actor      i realize this was the  s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife  virginia mayo     ray teal  who played the right wing bigot  years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on  bonanza     the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving  boring and poorly acted  the professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films  the beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity  excessive violence and gratuitous sex    i was surprised that zero out of   people found my review useful
