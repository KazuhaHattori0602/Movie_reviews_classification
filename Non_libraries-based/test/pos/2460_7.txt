this film easily rivals the emotional strength  the dramatic impact and the top notch performances of   angry men  i rented it on a whim and was amazed that i had not heard of it before   i do not know if this was emilio estevez s directorial debut  but the pacing  the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye   the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie  kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism  a variation on her character in  at play in the fields of the lord  she is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time   there are some moments where i feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between estevez and his ex girlfriend almost seem written for another film  estevez comes off as another character all together  but those are minor complaints   this film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences  i rate it   out of a difficult
