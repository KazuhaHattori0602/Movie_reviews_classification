i don t understand how people could not like this movie  you have gossit jr  the kid who played the main character in stand by me  sean astin  and many other great actors  lots of action and fun that you don t see in today s movies anymore  it s really a shame    this is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like let s get harry  the  s and early  s created such great movies that will never again be topped by today s standards    they tried to somehow recreate this movie in masterminds  but came up short with some really bad acting  the only thing that movie had going was patrick stewart  but obviously that wasn t enough
