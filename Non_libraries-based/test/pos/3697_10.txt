this movie is excellent the passion between jade   billy is memorable and the acting was great  this is why you don t leave a   year old and a young man like that alone together  it shows why a single mother shouldn t date a younger man with a teen aged daughter in the house  cause he looked young enough to be jessy s son   i give it ten out of ten  the acting was wonderful and the movements between the actors was correct   the age difference between jenny and rob was good too  because they were similar in age   overall  its a fun movie but i think nobody under   should watch this movie because of the sexual scenes
