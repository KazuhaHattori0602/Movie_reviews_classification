recently i saw this movie again  after   years  in the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between jacqueline bisset s character and michael brandon s character  the rented version did not have this scene in it  did i imagine this   or  is this part of the  clean up  of movies where some are altered to exclude portions some people think are not  appropriate   i love this movie   it is exactly like the friendship between a friend and i and we ve been friends for   years and saw it together  her husband thought it was us as well   thank you  joan
