with two old friends   i ve always enjoyed both lemmon s and mathaeu s films  and of course their team efforts are always worth watching  and often hilarious   although i didn t personally regard this film as in the hilarious category  it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of  s style romantic comedy plots   brent spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical cruise director   gloria dehaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive
