if you have enjoyed the butterfly effect  donnie darko or the machinist  you will enjoy k pax too   to me  this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end  spacey delivers a great performance as prot  also  lets not forget the appearance of saul williams in the movie  who i am a big fan of   after watching it  i recommended the movie to lots of my friends  and everyone was pretty much blown away   but still  it is very underrated  maybe because of the lack of action and explosions  i m sorry  this is not a movie about blowing things up  it s about how humans behave  and how people live in worlds that don t exist   go on  and enjoy
