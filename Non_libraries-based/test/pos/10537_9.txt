i saw this at the tribeca film festival  in the family section  i m not sure either of my kids really got the movie  but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film    nostradamus and me  is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the  s  which in turn  extends to how my kids feel today  then  we had regan  today  we got bush  instead of nuclear war  we have terrorism   i really identified with the main character  and i myself dated a  curehead  in high school  we all felt like  nothing mattered  when we were   but it s great to see a film where they discover that everything matters    again  i probably wouldn t have put this in the family section there were a few too many curse words for younger children  but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch
