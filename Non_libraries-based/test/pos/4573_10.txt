idiocracy felt like mike judge took my thoughts on society and put them into film  in fact  the movie is a social commentary  almost feels like a documentary at times  luke wilson did a good job playing a boring average joe  like in most of his movies   of course idiocracy was an extreme of the current state of society  but that s what makes most comedies funny  a extreme of any situation  fiction isn t that much different then reality   with kids praising materialist hip hop culture and taking pride in being ignorant  when people feel useless in life  they breed  giving them a purpose in the world  and it seems only the worse people breed the most  i can understand how others don t like it  it doesn t help most of the jokes were  nd grade bathroom humor  not much different than a kevin smith film   idiocracy throws away logic  reason  any intelligence  for good reason   mike judges comeback was a knockout
