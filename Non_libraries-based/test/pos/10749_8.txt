this production was quite a surprise for me  i absolutely love obscure early  s movies  but i wasn t prepared for the last   minutes of this story  if  by any chance  you re not convinced in the first half  hang in there for the finale  of course  you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical  a fascinating viewing experience  but i think the cat s paw is not available on video dvd yet  watch your pbs listings
