another period piece for chen kiage   can t remember him doing a modern film   good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises  none of the hk fighting scenes  or the hollywood type of heroes  but it is good because of it  the characters are strong  i really felt for them   understanding the mandarin definitely gives the english subtitles the edge  the film is   hours  but it didn t feel like it
