fascinating and amusingly bad  lights of new york is the first all talkie feature and one that almost never saw the light of day   two naive barbers  eddie and gene  from out of town get involved with bootleggers and end up fronting a speak  when a cop is shot by one of the bootleggers the police start to close in  and the hawk  who shot the officer  decides to pin the murder on eddie instructing his henchman to  take him for a ride  but it s the hawk himself who takes the bullet in a twist that will surprise few   shot in one week at a cost of    lights  was originally meant as a two reeler but foy took advantage of jack warner s absence to extend it to six  when warner discovered this he ordered foy to cut it back to the original short  only when an independent exhibitor offered  k for the film  did warners actually look at the film  which went on to make a staggering   million   seen now this is an extremely hokey piece  with acting that ranges from the passable  eugene pallette  to trance like  eddie s granny in a particularly risible scene  and much of the playing is at the level of vaudeville  since it s an early talkie   part talkies preceded it  that s about all the characters do  and very slowly at that  the script feels improvised  visual style is non existent  apart from the shooting scene done in silhouette  and scenes grind on interminably  title cards are intercut which redundantly announce characters and locales   despite all this  lights  is a compelling experience  as we watch actors and crew struggling with the alien technology  and changing cinema for ever   catch it if you can
