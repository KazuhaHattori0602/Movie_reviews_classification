i found this to be an underrated  quietly compelling spaghetti western  also known as dead or alive  despite modest credentials  apart from multi purpose co writer producer albert band  the only notable crew member is composer carlo rustichelli  the film clearly benefits from the presence of its three american stars  newcomer alex cord is an ambiguous anti hero  while veterans arthur kennedy and robert ryan lend a mythic quality to the proceedings  as well as the unusual plot  involving a crippled protagonist  an amnesty ruse covering a strategic clean up of the town  and which has the law finally siding with the gunfighter against a horde of mexican bandits   there are several tough action scenes on hand   the film is capped by a terrific climax in which the star trio is besieged inside a blazing cabin   plus a couple of outrageous moments which are something of a spaghetti western trademark  from the middle of the street  cord sees a hidden gunman at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle  a man who helps cord escape is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains  nicoletta machiavelli also makes a nice impression as a village girl with whom cord lodges  the supporting cast  then  is peppered with familiar  if largely anonymous  faces   all of them essentially genre fixtures   i wasn t aware of the fact that the english dubbed version of the film on mgm ua s r  dvd was cut  i was fooled by the wrong running time being listed on the back cover  the film was only   minutes long and not     apparently  cord s character is killed in the longer italian version
