i always enjoy watching this cartoon  with sylvester trying to catch tweety on a train  rather than at grandma s house  it s actually a standard fare  but entertaining  especially when tweety pulls the emergency stop cord  one of my complaints about this is how sloppy the animators were with the train  when you watch this over and over  like my little boy did  who loves trains  which is why he liked it so much  you begin to notice some things   throughout this short  the position of the baggage car changes on the train  either  rd   th or  th  and in long shots not at all  the engine has either the number   or   or none at all  the coal tender has either the number   or the letters  s p    q r  on it  or no number or letters at all  the coaches carry the  s p q r  without the   in long shots  and then in closeups it has the words  southeast and western   all of this doesn t interfere with the story  but the production details were obviously not looked into very carefully    still this cartoon is among my favorites with sylvester and tweety
