well  it took them   tries  but they finally got it right  in this  th sequel to the karate kid franchise  the producers really hit a home run  well first of all i applaud them for finally getting rid of ralph macchio  i felt he never did service to the role of the karate kid  i would have rather have seen danny  ralph mouth  most in that role  macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series  and look where his career is now  instead they put in a girl  they got hillary swank  best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in  i personally don t care for her buck teeth  but thats a personal preference  but still  look how karate kid   launched her career into orbit  she won a freakin oscar  jiminey christmas  meanwhile where is ralphy  he should put out some amateur porn tape like screech or something   anyways  my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate  as a self proclaimed master of karate  i have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last     years  the first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls  well except for judo  but thats kinda gay  so for the purposes of accuracy  i think they should have stuck with another male for this role  i was thinking perhaps dennis franz  he would give the role the depth it requires   perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in karate kid   its too pat marita is no longer  i was thinking maybe justin guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable asian fellow mr  miyagi  he will give  wax on wax off  a whole new meaning  hahahahahaha funny huh  anyways  if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with karate and triumph of the human spirit  karate kid   is for you  don t waste your time with   this is the karate kid for you  this is the karate kid for r the ages
