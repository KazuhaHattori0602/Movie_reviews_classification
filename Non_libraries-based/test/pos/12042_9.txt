darr is an brilliant movie it is   of my favourite films srk has done a mind blowing job in the movie   this role couldn t have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits srk   srk plays a mental villain in the film   srk s performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood   srk deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance   juhi also delivers an excellent performance   sunny deol looked strong and physically fit in the film
