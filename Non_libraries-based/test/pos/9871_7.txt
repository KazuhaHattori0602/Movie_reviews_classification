i bought this in the budget department last week  i had halloween and halloween ii already  and since i aim to collect every horror film ever  i chose this  after all  the  st two were good   this film is pretty intelligent to tell the truth  it seems to create the correct atmosphere  and has a nice  history of michael myers  it uses the old locations from the original  and the main character is the kid whom laurie strode babysat that fateful halloween in    the climax also is fairly satisfying  anyways  it is a lot better than h  which frankly  is absolute crap
