 l  a space odyssey  is a supremely intriguing space travel journey with a profound look at mankind s future  it is one of the very few great films of our times  it gives us something to think  talk and argue  it wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity  it inspires us to dig for insights   as a science fiction fantasy  it is one of the most original films ever made  kubrick s camera dances to the  blue danube  with planets floating exuberantly through the light years  it s an experience in the poetry of motion  a rich statement to the power of cinema   but   reveals that it s not really a science fiction film after all  it s  instead  a philosophical enigma  a magnificent meditation on man s place in the grand scheme of things  and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else     is a unique film about man s evolution told in almost subliminal terms  the people in this classic science fiction epic hardly matter  kubrick relates a chronology in images of things the mountains  the desert  the technology  the space capsule  the computer named hal  who is more interesting than the humans  and the time warp  the final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius   as a terror story  too  it is a towering achievement  not on the same scream inducing level as hitchcock s  psycho  but in an innocent and far more haunting way the film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture s vision of man  in kubrick s fantasy  the golden age of man was a neglected instant between a man ape s exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the earth  man has indeed evolved   as a spectacle   assaults the mind  eye and ear  with stimulating images and suggestions  we are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment  the film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments  the first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually  without a single line of dialog  the zero gravity toilet with its great list of instructions  the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down  the frightening moment when we realize that hal is reading the astronauts lips  the magical alignments of sun  moon  and earth  the  starchild  returning home to charm the orb     is filled with poetic imagery  the view of the sun rising over the earth  the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion  the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet     is also a work of great visual acuity  it allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man  its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery  they insist upon an answer where there can only be a question  every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of kubrick s film
 but for those who can accept mysticism  the climax is deeply moving
