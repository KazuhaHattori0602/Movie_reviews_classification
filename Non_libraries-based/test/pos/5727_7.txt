ok  on the whole  this three part documentary will bring most interested people up to date with going s on in the world of physics  and the last   years of discovery of our universe  if you have read stephen hawkings brilliant book  a brief history of time  and understood it then you might benefit from the visual description of certain concepts which i did to a certain extent  greene is bearable  but obviously for the sake of the masses  tends to explain things in a slighty patronising way  this is of course deliberate and will be perfect for almost everyone who watches this series   the guest scientists were good   no hawking  but i suppose he has his own dvd s    i kept waiting for him to appear but they rotate through the same ones for almost   parts   very american weighted here  with a few brits and one antipodean  i bought the nova   disc edition  ntsc  and there were a few inclusions that really detracted from the overall experience     the  this is brought to you by  at the start of each part was a necessary evil for the first part  but seeing it   more times before it was over was very ordinary     can t be helped i suppose but there is quite a bit of overlap at the start of   and   which had me reaching for the ffw button a few times     this disc set was straight from tv ie ads  what happen last show for those that missed it  and frequent  goto pbs org for more    appearing throughout the presentation   quite unlike bbc material which is unmatched for presentation planets  the blue planet  etc  my   is based on content alone  the niggles were there but i got over them  if this had have been done with that classic british accented presenter  you know the one  it would be a perfect disc set in my opinion   if you have seen this and want more then i highly recommend hawkings book   a brief history of time  i wish it was a movie too   happy viewing
