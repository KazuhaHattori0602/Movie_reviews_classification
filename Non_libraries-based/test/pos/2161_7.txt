check out the first   minutes even though the suspense hasn t yet kicked in  we get a pretty good look at super secret los alamos just a few years after the big bomb test that helped end wwii  except for the tight security  it looks unthreatening enough  note how it s a tv repairman  an obvious regular guy  who takes us through security  once through  it s like any town usa  nice homes  quiet streets  kids going to school  and a family tv on the blink  later on we see little tommy and little peggy frolicking along streets lined with impressive looking facilities separated by locked gates  the movie appears to be saying   okay  we re tough  only because we have to be  but  basically  we re still just folks   now  i expect that was a comforting message to cold war audiences still not used to government s  dooms day  research  it s a clear effort at popular reassurance  the one darker note is when tommy s mother  clarke  worries about her son s mental state  he doesn t say   when i grow up  instead  it s   if i grow up  that note of doubt not only reflects a los alamos reality  but also a national one that in   had just seen footage of the apocalyptic h bomb  note too  how professionally fbi agents are portrayed  a standard feature of mccarthy era fare  when brute force is needed  it s not they  but private citizen gene barry who thrashes out the information an early version  i suppose  of modern era  rendition   once the kidnapping occurs  the suspense doesn t let up  the intrigue is nicely handled with colorful la locations that keep us guessing  the climactic scenes around the cliff dwellings may not be plausible as a hiding place  but the view of northern new mexico is great  then too  the ancient stone apartments amount to one of the more exotic backdrops of the decade  note also the extensive use of the police helicopter just coming into use as a law enforcement tool  among an otherwise subdued cast  nancy gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher ellen haskell  never hollywood glamorous  she was still a fine unsung actress and winning personality  i also expect this was one of director hopper s more successful movie efforts  and though people have since gotten used to the nuclear threat  the movie remains a revealing and riveting document of its time
