i saw this movie as part of the midnite madness at sitges  set in  th century england  the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave robber to his final confession on the eve of his execution   the plot moves along via a series of misadventures involving arthur and his partner encountering various unsavory characters and bizarre situations   the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors  the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden graveyards  rowdy tavern scenes and excellent set costume design   for a movie titled i sell the dead  i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror   don t get me wrong there are some jumpy moments and gore  but the tone is very much comedic  driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog  the closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads  larry fessenden and dominic monaghan  is the character interaction seen in the classic english comedies only fools and horses  the two ronnies and morecambe and wise   the acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in ron perlman and angus scrimm lift the movie above many of the others on view in sitges   overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face
