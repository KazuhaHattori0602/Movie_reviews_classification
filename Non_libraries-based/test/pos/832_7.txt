this film is good in it s genre and that genre is naturally action with a little average budget  looks like van damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him  there is your basic bar brawl  alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting  some basic drama  but nothing too deep  isaac florentine directs an ok action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it  but the person who steals the show is    scott adkins  how come this guy isn t a massive arnold schwarzenegger caliber action star that i don t know  director isaac florentine has made a movie with scott adkins before called special forces   which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic  another amazing scott adkins feature is undisputed   check this guy out and make a noise  this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now   what else can i say about the movie  it s van damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work  no oscars here for sure  but you already knew that  but never the less it has a nice little town feel and i could find worse ways to spend my time  so i m giving this a solid   out of   in it s genre
