definitely a  must see  for all fans of film noir   thanks to a fine script and crisp  razor sharp direction a top cast comes together and works like a well oiled clock to produce a crackerjack psychological thriller   wonderful characterizations articulate the movie s powerful message of racial and religious tolerance  it s difficult and almost unjust to single out any one particular performance because there isn t a weak link in the entire company but robert ryan as the hateful and violent white supremacist is truly spine chilling   making this film in the  s would have taken a lot of courage  now all these years later  at a time when contemporary movies are dominated by a ridiculous over abundance of foul language  bare breasts  crummy acting and deafening soundtracks it s refreshing to get back to the basics of quality film making with a viewing treat like  crossfire   another low budget gem from the hollywood archives
