out of all the mafia movies i have ever seen this is one of the best for many reasons  the acting from pesci  cortese and vincent  the story is one of the best ever  in the mafia genre  as it realistic  the characters are people that lots of other people can relate to  this movie is also great as it s dialogue is good  it also has very realistic fights and action scenes  this movie also launched the careers of pesci and vincent  if it weren t for the success of this film  casino and goodfellas might not have been as good as they were    story   acting   realism    overall    my fave mafia movies are    goodfellas   casino   the godfather trilogy   family enforcer  the death collector    the sopranos  i know it isn t a movie
