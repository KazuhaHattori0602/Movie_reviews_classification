i remember seeing this film in the theater in   when i was   years old  you do the math  i absolutely loved it  i was tarzan for the   weeks after seeing it  climbing the furniture  jumping around making monkey sounds  it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys  but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert  keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this    was the last time i saw that film  until about a month ago  it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at   am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at   am  i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid    upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that  that andie macdowell s voice was dubbed by someone else  ian holme was of course solid as usual  and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up  but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan  he was great  the depth he managed to capture in so few lines  his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark  were just amazing   as i stated earlier i am lambert fan  but i m used to highlander  the hunted and fortress  in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again   so to make a short story way too long  i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good  but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until  am to see it
