the argentinian music poet  atahualpa yupanqui  once said that some folk music repeats similarly at any country of the world  they look the same but everybody consider them as their own folk music   this film  as i feel it  is about the same music that repeats all over the world at some time of each country s history  first  a few listen it playing and try to make the others hear it  then some  believe that they hear it  but they don t  then  nobody says anything and some people appear to listen to it  and others recognize that they have heard it  but didn t think that others might be hearing it  finally  everybody listen to the same music  and suddenly it doesn t sound any more   love and poetry  as a real nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children   why would he call the film  the dead when nobody dies  the spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it dubliners  following james joyce s title   a nice   irish filmed postcard
