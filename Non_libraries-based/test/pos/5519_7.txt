i saw this movie on my local cable system under the title of  beyond redemption  i was searching for new material to watch  since most of the reruns one saturday morning didn t interest me  i ve always been a fan of andrew mccarthy and michael ironside  so i chose this movie  i was pleasantly surprised   personally  i enjoyed the film  rich roesing  who posted a comment about the film being spoiled for him by seeing scenes from the movie on the back of a video rental box  are well justified  i did not have the disappointment of knowing beforehand anything about the film  this led me to rate the movie higher than the average score listed on the page   i like suspense movies  and this one was no exception  the movie kept me guessing until the very end  i was surprised by the ending   the moments of reflection and remembrance of past experiences by the main character during the film only added to the suspense  his reactions to those remembrances gave the film a sense of the humanitarian  yet conflictual  side of police work  the struggle with his faith is also a welcome addition   if you like suspense films  but also like films that expound on the character s feeling  personal inflection side  this film is for you   should you find this movie on your local cable or satellite system s guide  watch it   however  if you are looking for a rental video  follow rich roesing s advice and have someone get the video for you before watching it
