critics and audiences both pretty much panned this movie  but i actually didn t think it was too bad  even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap  and i normally despise pg   horror films  so this means one of two things  either   i m too easily pleased  and my taste in movies has dwindled over the years  or    when a stranger calls  isn t nearly as horrible as it s made out to be  now  to be fair  some of the criticisms of the movie are true there s not much character development  and not much happens in the story  but man alive folks  how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked  cut them some slack  as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out  i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy mofo  who knows  i guess stuff like this just gives me the willies   yes  i admit i had fun watching this  and i don t care how big of a minority that puts me in
