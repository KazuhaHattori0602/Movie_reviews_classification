the   episodes of  the lone ranger  were originally broadcast on abc from   to   and then for many years they played in local syndication  for most of the original broadcast years the series was abc s most watched piece of programming    the new dvd set from pop flix contains the first   episodes   sept  dec   and for some reason unknown to me episode   from the fifth season  for a total of   episodes  the same   available on last year s mill creek entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain  these sets pretty much render  the legend of the lone ranger  movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in   to form the movie are included in these releases    the early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments    the series itself was pure kiddie western with clear cut good and evil distinctions and no romance  the title character  played by clayton moore  started out texas ranger john reid  the first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to lone ranger status  his partnering with the indian tonto  jay silverheels  and the taming of his horse  silver    there is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode  the lone ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil  while a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an indian was distrusted  the lone ranger is feared by those who would do evil  one persistent theme is that when the lone ranger and tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion  and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value  the trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question   who was that masked man    to really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be  if you don t take it seriously and keep wishing for some self reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated    then again  what do i know  i m only a child
