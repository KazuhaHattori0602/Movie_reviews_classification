as a movie  the italian job is ok at best  good  not great  acting   nice visuals and pacing  a mediocre plot  but nothing bad enough  to walk out on  but as a car commercial for the new breed of mini  coopers  this film is spectacular    spoilers   ok  it s a typical heist film with the odd twist  the underwater safe  cracking was nice  if not improbable  and the cast was fairly solid   with the exception of a putrid wahlberg  but when it all came  down to it  the real  stars  of this picture were the three mini  coopers  in all their high flying  speed racing  ramp jumping   bullet taking  gold lugging  shiny new glory  the audience i was  sitting amongst actually  ooed  and  aahed  when theron s little  red number first hit the screen  strangely enough  neither she nor  wahlberg garnered the same reaction   the film starts out promising  mos def  seth green  donald  sutherland  edward norton and jason statham all begin as an  interesting and humourous band of characters  with the only real  uninspired performance being that of the usually good mark  wahlberg  why he claims this is his best film i can t imagine  his  character is completely one note  and he plays him so blandly it  was as if mr  rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting  his body  charlize is fine as sutherland s daughter  though  nothing magical  seth green s character is perfect and the  running napster jokes  including a cameo by napster founder   shawn fanning  are hilarious  he and some of mos def s early  lines add some much needed sparks of humour  unfortunately   edward norton and donald sutherland don t get near enough  screen time   you can see most of the plot coming from a mile away  and the  dialogue is rife with bad one liners and give aways  but i doubt the  filmmakers were out to re invent the wheel here  so taken as a  typical action suspense flick it comes out alright  worth seeing on  cheap night i d recommend     not worth it s weight in gold  but makes for nice fillings
