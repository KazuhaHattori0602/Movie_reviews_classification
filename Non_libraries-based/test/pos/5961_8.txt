excellent exercise on multiple plans     showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in france     more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western people    a renewal of the spy and thriller movies  oss   is uncultured and stupid   the good idea is that  in spite of all these messages  it is a funny film  plenty of jokes and gags  very light and sparkling   special mention to jean dujardin and berenice bejo   definitely worth seeing  wonder how it will be appreciated in us   seems to be a success in france  so probably a next version will come
