women will like this movie better than men  of course  women like all romantic comedies more than men   on average  i generally like romantic comedies quite a bit  however i considered this a   for the first   of the movie and about a   for the next   and about a   for the last   so  begrudgingly  i will rate it a   i tape and keep all movies rated a   or better and none that are a   or worse   at least that s my objective  i have over   movies  so why keep the dogs   my wife liked this movie quite a bit more than me  though i m not sure why  i am a bigger drew barrymore fan than she is   the whole point of this movie was about a young woman who goes back to high school  undercover  to write a story about the high school experience nowadays  she was a dork in high school the first time around and has to learn how to be cool the second time around  her journey toward cooldom  as well as her falling in love with a teacher  is the story   what drove me nuts for the first half the movie was just how mangy she looked  i wondered why they would pick her for this role until i realized how capable she is at looking like a dog  so much so that i truly don t think i want to see her in   years when she gets up in the morning  argh  naturally  she transformed into a rather attractive  cute  woman by the end and she became very popular   the ending is about a   on the very sweet scale  so you sappers out there will like that  otherwise  it isn t very memorable and easily missable
