if we consider three films with a similar subject  which are this one  which was made in    the covered wagon  made in   and  wagon master  made in   the distance between  the big trail  and  the covered wagon  is only   years whereas the distance between  the big trail  and  wagon master  is   years  this is amazing because it shows how much movies evolved in those   years  and how in the next   years the changes were slow to come   the big trail is technically close to  wagon master  but ages apart from  the covered wagon  the story is about the pioneers going from the missouri to the west in oregon  tyrone power sr  is the man leading the caravan  he is a rough and mean guy  john wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks  not giving him a chance to be the wayne that we are used to  marguerite churchill is such a proud lady that you wonder why wayne just does not forget her  raoul walsh was a master at showing caravans and cattle moving through the west  he directed  the tall men  in   which has a lot in common with  the big trail
