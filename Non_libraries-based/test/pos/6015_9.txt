and i for one think that is a good thing  i ve just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie  but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this   as for the rest of the production  i think it was slightly less than the original movie  one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails on the blackboard voice belting out  hey  it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah  and although i missed it  i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy   i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage  it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre  not just at the movies   i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song  let me entertain you  which becomes completely annoying after about the  th time you hear it
