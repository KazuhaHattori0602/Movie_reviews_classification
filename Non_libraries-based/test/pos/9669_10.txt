ignore the comment before mine  the show is comic genius  most underrated show ever    reasons why  reason   the flashbacks are hilarious  who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story  they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn t that the idea of a good comedy programme  people who think this isn t funny just have no sense of humour  who cares if they are random  its a t v  show  you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic  neither is a cartoon  its animated  reason   the jokes are just generally hilarious  seth mcfarlane and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny  everything from the star wars references to making fun of celebrities  i love them all  and reason   the story lines are just brilliant and funny  they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness  just all the more funnier   i caught this one late night on bbc  and have never gone back  i have all   seasons  plus the kind of movie thing  stewie griffin  the untold story  i have several t shirts  posters and my collection is still growing  i ve never got a collection of any tv show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything    just watch season   and trust me you will be hooked for life  the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends
