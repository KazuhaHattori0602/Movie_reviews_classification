just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good     thought it was a lame ass movie  but not at all  many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying    this movie has enough blood  gore  and some sexy make out scenes of course  to keep any horror buff like me   satisfied  the cast was also pretty good imo    even though its not a high budget movie  the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes    worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure     tom
