great little ground breaking movie  in   about an important subject   i wasn t expecting much from sinatra s performance and was pleasantly surprised by it  loved kim novak  she was gorgeous   loved the jazz score by elmer bernstein  as great as that by lazlo schifrin for  bullitt  i am very surprised it doesn t seem available on cd  if anyone knows about the soundtrack s availability on any other format  they should post it here somewhere   preminger s direction was  as usual  borderline flawless   haven t read nelson algren s novel nor have any idea how faithful the screenplay was to it  the subplot of frankie as a  hot  card dealer was a bit of a surprise  too  as were a few other things  but see for yourself  it s very much worth seeing
