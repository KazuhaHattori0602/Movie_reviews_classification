anyone that is looking for an episode of  law and order  or  csi  would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case   a murder took place  and all the police did was to grab a  year old boy off the street and take him to the only witness   a  year old man   and say is this the guy who did it  sure  the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty  never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently  he must have shrunk  reversed his age by   years and changed clothes   the police made absolutely no effort   and they admitted it  the did no forensics on any of the evidence  they questioned no other witnesses  and they beat a confession out of a  year old   the saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in jacksonville  florida  let everyone now start talking about  southern justice
