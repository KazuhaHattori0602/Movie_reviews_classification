this movie almost has everything  the action is cool  it s funny    great leading men and a truly nasty villain that i really hated  not a lot of films have bad bad guys  just mainly comic book villains  he really does deserve a might ass kicking   jake scott really does have his fathers talent for knowing how to make great visuals  the direction is faultless and has an irresistible lighthearted feel  i don t usually like films set in the old days but this i liked a lot because it makes a point of boring like so many other period films are  sense and sensibility  age of innocence and the absolute worst lady and the duke  this will restore your faith  thanx mostly to craig armstrong s amazing score  the music is both atmospheric and ethereal and in scenes of action it is very exciting   the dvd is in dolby   and has a very grainy and muddy looking   anamorphic picture
