seriously any film with john malkovich is usually very good  and this includes clint eastwood  rene russo  john mahoney  frasier  dylan mcdermott  the practice  and many more great actors   clint is getting old now but thanks he is also an awesome director  in his own right   we are used to wolfgang  water films  like das boot  poseidon and perfect storm   this was really different but just as sublimely directed   the premise of the assassin is as serious as it comes  the film is well paced  some of the violence is a bit  but altogether recommended  but not for kids
