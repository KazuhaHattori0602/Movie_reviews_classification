so it isn t an epic  but for people experiencing anything similar   sibling suicide  it might be an interesting way of therapy  an  imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well  spent  for some reason  it hasn t really caught on in the audience   something i do believe is a result of the main theme  why did she  commit suicide  clearly  this is hardly something that us  moviegoers will flock to  had it been an european production it  probably would have reached its audience in a much greater  extent  it is however  a movie that although the realism tainted by a  shimmering romanticized glow  gives the viewer a whole hearted  impression
