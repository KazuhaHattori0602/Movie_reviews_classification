a wonderful film in the best scandinavian eldritch magic tradition  with very far sighted analysis of much of the big issues we are just starting to face   should be compulsory viewing for all politicians   take your pick from privacy  nuclear sustainability  global climate change  quality of life   reminiscent of thoreaus  walden  but with modern twist  and considerable humour    i m not finnish  although i ve travelled there and have good finnish friends  but i found it totally accessible  and also culturally informative
