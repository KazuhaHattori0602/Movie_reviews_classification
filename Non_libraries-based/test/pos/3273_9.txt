spoiler   in   african american director actor mario van peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban action film new jack city with  posse  the film was co written and directed by van peebles  who also stars as the main character  jessie lee   plot  the film begins at the turn of the  th century  when the united states was embroiled in the spanish american war  apparently a time when the u s  justice system could send convicts into military service  jessie lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man  serving with an all black cavalry troop in cuba  some of his compatriots include little j  stephen baldwin  fast talking weezie  charles lane  and the towering but simple obobo  tiny lister  they find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it  however  the ambitious  bigoted colonel graham  zane  finds out about the gold  and is apparently willing to kill jessie lee and company for it  a shootout between the graham s forces and jessie lee s leaves the colonel blind in one eye  and his forces retreat  jessie lee s ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves  and the gold  back to new orleans  but it turns out that graham isn t far behind  jessie lee and his allies are forced to go on the run  heading west  to a town called freemanville  apparently  freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the civil war  jessie lee s father   king david  was the charismatic preacher who co founded the town  however  as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks  king david was soon brutally murdered by a white mob  in a parallel of the ku klux klan terror campaigns that began around the same time  jessie lee and company eventually find their way to freemanville  only to find that the townsfolk aren t exactly glad to see him especially when sheriff bates  richard jordan  of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants jessie lee and his partners dead or alive  carver  blair underwood  is the sheriff and de facto mayor of freemanville and his own agenda may not square with having jessie lee around   analysis the action sequences are all very credible  and mario van peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero  in the aftermath of the success of new jack city  it was almost expected van peebles would helm a sequel  or at least a similar urban action follow up  instead  van peebles looked   years into the past  creating a mostly black western  effectively  updating  the black themed westerns of the  s  and continuing the legacy of largely forgotten black themed cowboy films from the early  th century  unlike new jack city  the film was independently financed  and originally released through gramercy polygram entertainment  allegedly  execs at the major studios balked when van peebles pitched  posse  to them  some of the more  curious  casting at the time involved rappers big daddy kane and tone loc as father time and angel  respectively  in certain interviews  mario van peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type  in the years since  the trend of casting rap singers in non musical films would become almost commonplace  keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities  black action film veterans like isaac hayes  truck turner  pam grier  foxy brown  and larry cook  the spook who sat by the door  show up  as does stand up legend nipsey russell  not to mention tv producer stephen j  cannell  who hired the junior van peebles to star in  sonny spoon  years earlier  the film is bookended with woody strode  spartacus  in a key role
