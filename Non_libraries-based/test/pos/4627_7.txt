at  pm in a bathroom at an adelaide highschool a student takes their own life and the different worlds of six teenagers are changed forever     is a brutal  honest and breathtaking film centered on the pain of being a teenager  the film follows one day in the lives of six teenagers  all intertwined  all dealing with their own personal dramas  while there are a couple of stereotypes in the mix   the beautiful would be popular girl dealing with body issues  the over achiever obsessed with his grades  there are several horrors that are as far from main stream as you can get  including a social outcast dealing with a brutal illness and a young girl trying to make sense of a devastating event in her past   the movie is mixed with documentary style interviews from the characters  which some viewers may find a little out of place in the otherwise seamless narrative  the pace is also a little slow  but it fits with the feel of the movie  the young australian actors are all stars in their own right  in particular theresa palmer who s heartbreaking performance earned her an afi nomination   the film is very well shot  with terrific direction  some scenes are a little hard to watch   in particular the five minute long suicide scene  but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its  viewers  it draws you in right from it s shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom  ultimately  it s a beautiful made  but slightly disturbing look at teenage life
