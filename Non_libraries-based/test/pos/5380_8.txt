every great once in a while  you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations  given the imdb rating of   i wasn t really expecting much with the brotherhood of satan  i hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like the devil s rain or any of the other early  s similarly themed satanic horror films  i couldn t  have been more wrong  what i got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast i really enjoyed  speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away  the film s style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early  s  the brotherhood of satan doesn t beat you over the head with plot points and explanations  a lot is left to the viewer to fill in the blanks  as a viewer  you know something is amiss  but for the longest period you re just not sure what it is  the unknown helps make for a far creepier atmosphere than most similar films  the ending is effective with its surreal imagery  i sat in amazement as the final credits began to roll  those wanting a big slam bang finale will be disappointed with the ending s simplicity  a lesser film would have tried to pull out all the stops and would  most likely  have failed miserably   there are moments in the film where it s easy to forget the director  bernard mceveety  had primarily worked in television before the brotherhood of satan  there are a few scenes that are so well set up  lit  and shot that even the most accomplished of directors could learn a thing or two  for example  i ve seen enough films over the years to realize that directors can sometimes seem to have trouble shooting widescreen shots indoors  not here  the scene where the men are discussing their plan of action in the sheriff s office is amazing  we see all five men at once   each doing their own thing as in real life  in a lesser film  we might see all the men at once  but each would be motionless  quietly waiting their turn to deliver their dialogue  it s a small scene  but it looks so natural and is so beautifully shot that it s one of my favorite moments of the brotherhood of satan   finally  i mentioned the acting in my opening  so without going into a long winded speech  i ll just say that the brotherhood of satan features strother martin and l q  jones  any film with these two guys is almost an automatic winner with me
