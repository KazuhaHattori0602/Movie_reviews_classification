this is the fourth full length feature film by marc recha  by the third  les mans buides   empty hands  i promised myself not to cut my veins anymore  but this time round the plot is completely different  a kind of homage to ramon barnils  sabadell     reus   a catalan journalist  the visuals in the trailer are stunning  a gleaming river bathed in sunlight  and the promise that marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother  none of both professional actors  convinced me at last  six weeks after its release  abandon yourself in this very unusual road river film  learn almost nothing about ramon barnils but his most poignant legacy  his constant fight against amnesia of what we catalans chose to forget   la batalla de l ebre   look for battle of the ebro at the wikipedia  was lost not once but twice because after   years of silence and   years of half hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the spanish civil war and those who fought it  this film is about the lonely people roaming the same places with very little conscience of what took place there   years ago  this film is about the landscape
