i guess melville intended this movie to be the definition of the cool  it has the cool approach of the late  s  early  s thrillers the same discrete quirkiness  le cercle rouge  a bitter and fatalist story  is also the playground of delon  bourvil  volont  and montand in defining roles   bourvil is a cop who has in his flat three cats and a daily routine  delon is a hoodlum  montand is a sick  failed cop  volont  plays an escaped suspect  le cercle rouge is of course far above a heist movie  melville uses his techniques  long wordless detailed depictions of every step of the heist  etc  yet this particular action drama is far better than his other movies and it s very unlikely them by being so much better  the look of le cercle rouge is very peculiar to melville  very melvillian   delon was sharp and cool  bourvil brings his craft  and montand makes maybe the finest role of this movie  his performance has an unexpected warmth    on the other hand  the characters are barely sketched  no more than strictly necessary  and are personae  or masks  yet the portrayal is inspired  economic but suggestive   another of the movies that prove delon to be a good  a very good actor  and the fact that he s not a genius does not imply that he ought to be despised as a fourth rate actor  he s good  he can bear the proximity of a bourvil and montand   only ten yrs  before le cercle rouge  melville was doing  towards the end of the  s  a boring overlong insipid noir pastiche  starring himself and after only a decade  here he is  in full form  with this quite amazing action drama  stylistically  it s a success   before seeing le cercle rouge  i was not a melvillian fan  now i guess i rather am one   le cercle rouge is a drama namely  an action drama  one of the most exigent genres  melville scores
