ok  the show was a little uneven  but i still loved it  i found the main two bunnies annoying  but hamton   plucky were always amusing   i really want the baby plucky episodes on dvd  or even vhs  please release those   specifically the  potty years  episode aired on   the  going up  episode aired on   and the  minister golf  episode in    they are the funniest bits of the whole series and even over a decade later we still reference these bits    i have nothing more to say  please reduce the minimum to something like   lines and rewards us for brevity
