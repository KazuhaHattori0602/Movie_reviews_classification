i do not have much to say than this is a great finish to the story  most people have said that there is not enough plot and its just eye candy but think about it  everything was explained in ffvii you cannot add more plot to such a grand story it would ruin it  they did the best that they could do and i think that this should be taken more as a final fmv  the last fight    graphics     absolutely amazing   story     don t think they could of expanded it that much more  and the stuff they could put in there was clever enough i thought    characters     well most of them have already been explained during the game but still could not fit it all into   mins    sound     since i am a metal fan i loved the fight music  and piano just reaches right in there it is a great st and i was not disappointed   tilt replay     enjoyable every time    overall     ff fan view    i personally think this is what was needed  a fight to end it all  the plot was already in place  the action was necessary as much as people complained  i loved every second of this movie  it was a pleasure to visit the world of ffvii just one last time   just remember this  most movies that have been made form a game have been directed by movie directors i think this is pretty great for a team of game directors  don t think i ve seen a better game to movie   thankyou square  i think you did it right
