this is a beautifully made film  finely balancing the fragile human stories  both before and after   and the indiscriminating combat of war  the use of outtakes from battle of britain  a film that does not nearly so well portray the  s  enhances  rather than detracts from the whole  a deeply impressive work  this lived in my memory for the   years since i saw it  and i have just bought it to explore the making of extras   i highly recommend this film  movie  like  aces high  it alternates between viscerally exciting  or scary  air combat sequences  where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they d come to care about  but also unpredictable interactions on the ground  where skillful writers and real life experiences inform some involving and moving events  this also underlines the fact that for many people    marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another  and even today we still don t recognise the loss  bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes  or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails   making their sacrifices all the more valiant   watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy  and back to love that endures even beyond death  if all war films were like this  we d never have to fight again   did i mention it s worth watching
