 you can t take it realistically   sheets  zombie bloodbath    zb  is a world all of its own  i ve really never seen anything like it  the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs  forgive the clich i don t simply mean that it s incoherent and absurd  though occasionally it is  i mean that it takes you through such a broad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you  and when it s over  you find that it s all happened while you were sitting on the couch   it is worth noting that it s extremely low budget  as a disclaimer to those who  after seeing  shaun of the dead  consider themselves fans of underground zombie films  also of note is that it is much more  brutal  than you d expect  children get disemboweled  and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin  her corpse is subsequently  raped  these are certainly not flaws  and indeed i feel it is to the film s credit  but if it doesn t sound like your kind of movie  don t waste your time    i don t mean to over hype it  regarding brutality  don t go in expecting  inside  or something  i hesitate to give away any of the plot  because it s really full of surprises  even the opening scene  which has nothing to do with zombies  is at once a classic horror scene and something quite original   man  i m three paragraphs in and i ve hardly said anything at all  here s why i thought the movie was awesome    it s big  and it keeps moving  at one point  you expect it to turn into another notld clone  a board up the windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another  by the end of the film  however  the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream  there are also a number of outdoor  urban scenes  these are rare in low budget zombie films     the makeup gore is much better than zb  more convincing and more creative  something kind of funny  the early zombies look really lame  then  halfway through  they suddenly look really good  with prosthetics and everything  some of them look like fulci zombies  some are reminiscent of mr  tongue from  day of the dead  and it s got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around  never gets old     there s something oddly emotional about it  one character asserts that heaven exists  and that our dead undead protagonists are now in heaven  in the context of the film  we believe it to be true  though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity  they genuinely seem to care about each other  and accordingly  i found myself caring about them     the pacing is great  there s hardly a dull moment   my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i ve ever heard  i personally feel it adds to the experience  but i don t think he does it on purpose  so i can t fairly give the film a perfect rating   example  when a car breaks down  the owner yells at the passengers  then he says something to the effect of   sorry i yelled at you guys  you don t know what it s like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you re five years old  wtf  at the very end  it gets to be more than i can handle  involves a montage with bill clinton  and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor  really  by this point  i was firmly re living my drug experiences   highly recommended
