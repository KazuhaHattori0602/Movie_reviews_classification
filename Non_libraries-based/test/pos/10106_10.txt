this review is long overdue  since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made  i ll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay  cinematography  acting  post production  editing  directing  or any other aspect of film making  it s practically perfect in all of them   a true masterpiece in a sea of faux  masterpieces    the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema  i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute  quite literally  ji woon kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels  a seemingly insignificant object may be shown   a rack of dresses  two diaries  a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack  a bottle of pills  etc    but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more   a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene  or perhaps the movie in total  which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer s intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront  such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie  but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire  relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness  lest they miss something important  in other words  the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films  how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this  it s quite simply the highest  most superlative form of cinema imaginable   the most commonly cited criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely summarized by zaphod b goode  who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent  unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions  he posits that ji woon kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that  in reality  however  nothing could be further from the truth  a tale of two sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact occurrences of each and every scene of the film  if our good friend zaphod had been paying attention  he would have noticed   for example   the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film  these flashbacks convincingly contradict zaphod s assertion of complete subjectivity  the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them  can ji woon kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film  i think not   please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as zaphod that cannot  get  a tale of two sisters  because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence  the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer  yes  this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving  but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture  you need only put them together  remember  the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind   he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that   when completed   bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe   don t misunderstand me  there are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design  spider forest   perfect blue   and donnie darko   are perfect examples of this  a tale of two sisters is not  it s ironic that zaphod claims darko to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters  especially considering that darko not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina clich  that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence  i m ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence  but the contrast is an important one  although it does perplex me that zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort  he apparently likes his  intelligent  films in the most superficial form possible  this is evident when he makes   consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself  just read the threads by opiemar within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum  anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious   i d like to say more  but i ve come to my   word limit  all that has been said here needed to be said  so be it now said
