cult film maker corbucci s rarest of his thirteen spaghetti westerns  of which i m only left with what am i doing in the middle of the revolution [ ] to catch  is one i only became aware of fairly recently via marco giusti s  stracult  guide  it s an atypically bleak genre gem in the style of the director s own masterpiece  the great silence   complete with desolate snowy landscapes   johnny hallyday  the french elvis presley  whom i first saw in jean luc godard s detective   is a curious but highly effective choice to play the loner anti hero hud  who  like clint eastwood s the man with no name from sergio leone s celebrated  dollars trilogy  is fitted with a steel plate armor for protection  incidentally  i had  met  hallyday s stunning daughter laura smet at the   venice film festival but was distracted by the presence of her esteemed director  claude chabrol  gastone moschin is another curious addition to the fold  serving pretty much the same function that frank wolff did in the great silence  but acquits himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bathing francoise fabian  the latter  then  plays a greedy nymphomaniac of a banker s widow who seduces all and sundry in the pursuit of her goals  sylvie fennec has the other major female role as a farm girl looked after by hallyday and who  at one point  is entreated into free love by  hippie  apache gabriella tavernese  with this is mind  it s worth noting that the movie features surprising but welcome bouts of nudity from both fabian and tavernese  incidentally  the anachronistic addition of a bunch of long haired youths  who also engage in dope smoking and revolutionary talk  is a somewhat half baked attempt at contemporary relevance   but it all eventually adds to the fun  besides  even the black barmaid sports an afro hairdo   mario adorf  too  enjoys himself tremendously with the smallish role of a larger than life mexican bandit nicknamed  el diablo    who keeps a youthful biographer constantly by his side  an element which may have influenced clint eastwood s unforgiven [ ]  and  at one point  challenges the captive moschin to a head butting duel  having mentioned this  the film also contains one very unusual  weapon of death    as hallyday disposes of an adversary by kicking the cash register of the saloon into his face  as always  the enjoyably fake fistfights are accompanied by over emphatic sound effects  equally typically for the genre  however  the wistful score by angelo francesco lavagnino emerges a most significant asset  actually  the ambiguous ending is entirely in keeping with the film s generally somber tone   after fabian s comeuppance at the hands of the locals  the hippies  who had previously idolized hud  suddenly turn against him when wounded and terrorize the town  forcing everyone on the street and unclothed 
but the unflappable gunman manages to lift himself up to meet their challenge  they  however  scurry away at the prospect of facing him  and then rides out of town  leaving fennec behind   in conclusion  i acquired this via a good quality widescreen print in italian albeit with french credits and the occasional lapse   about one minute of screen time in all   into the french language  where  apparently  the original soundtrack wasn t available
