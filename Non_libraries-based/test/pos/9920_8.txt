opera opens with a very close up shot of a bird s ever watching eye and thus begins one of argento s most bizarre  and enjoyable  features  my second favorite in fact  behind deep red  granted  at times  the movie is pretty absurd  the lack of real concern after murders  the bird attack  the burnt dummy  that ending
  but this is argento s fantastical world and once you come to terms with that  you ll find that it works  i do not mean to completely dismiss these faults though  rather that the artistry of the film more than makes up for them  for example  the aforementioned bird attack is completely over the top in theory  yet look at the wonderful execution of it  crows flying in chaos  adding their enraged squawking to the driving rock beat  the crowd in panic as seen through the circling  bird s eye view camera work  and then the focused attack  aria of terror indeed  argento s amazing  flowing cinematography is on full display in opera  and clearly one of the film s highlights  i also enjoyed the soundtrack of operatic themes and rock music  a nice contrast of music with each used effectively  the rock kicks in with the murders in perfect timing and gives the scenes a very frenzied feel  the sound effects deserve a nod too  stabs  scissors  beaks  and all   inspector alan santini   i ve seen a lot of your movies  yes  you re really an expert in this field  i d be very interested to know your opinion   marco   i think it s unwise to use movies as a guide for reality  don t you inspector   inspector alan santini   depends what you mean by reality   being that this is a giallo  stylish murders are a must and dario does not disappoint  the  bullet through the door  scene is quite possibly one of the greatest deaths ever shot  if you ll forgive the pun  the black gloved  deep voiced  pulsating brained  cool shots  killer is cold and brutal  and having him tape pins under our heroine s eyes so that she was forced to watch the murders was a nice touch  that all said  as a giallo  opera doesn t quite have as good of a mystery as it should  the killer is kept secret from the audience well enough but there s little effort in the film devoted to actually solving the murders  this  and the strange ending  could ve used more work  despite these problems though  opera still manages to be a worthwhile and satisfying horror film   one final note  it was nice to see a movie  for once  show the correct view through binoculars  just a circle  not two circles together  nice eye for detail  dario
