this was the best film of   and one of the best of the  s  yes  it is a rip off of goodfellas  but as the saying goes  good poets borrow  great poets steal  and pta has stolen brilliantly from some of the best  plus added some genius touches of his own  i gave this a ten  which is very rare for me   the main reason i am commenting on this though  cause i could just rave all night  is all those people who have seen it on vhs standard issue what are you thinking  this deserves the full screen experience  look at the ratio it was shot in  i saw it   times at the cinema and haven t bothered to watch it on video   nuff said
