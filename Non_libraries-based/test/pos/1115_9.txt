i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films  i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour   i was a little drunk and tired   i went to bed  and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep  i couldn t stop thinking about why  so i got up  switched the tv back on  loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the movie   well done alex frayne sir  you ve managed to implant your film into this old  cynical movie goers head  and that takes doing  so   out of   to you   i can t say i  love  this film of yours  but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc
