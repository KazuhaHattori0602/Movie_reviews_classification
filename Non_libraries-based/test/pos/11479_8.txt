yesterday i finally satisfied my curiosity and saw this movie  my knowledge of the plot was limited to about   seconds of the trailer  but i had heard some good critics which caused my expectations to increase   as i saw the movie  those untied pieces had been combined in a story that was becoming quite intriguing  with some apparently inexplicable details  but in the end  everything is disclosed as a simple succession of events of bad luck   sorte nula  in portuguese  above everything  i felt that the story made sense  and everything fits in it s place  properties of a good script   i must also mention the soundtrack  which helps the creation of an amazing environment   and if you think of the resources fernando fragata used to make this film  i believe it will make many hollywood producers envious
