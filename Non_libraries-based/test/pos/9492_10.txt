some people don t like led zeppelin  but luckily the number of people who versus the number of people who don t is way unbalanced  i am the proud converter of   or   led zeppelin fans and the only reason i was able to do this is because of this dvd   for one  how someone can listen to  stairway to heaven  or  immigrant song  without falling in love with zeppelin is beyond me  but to play the guitar and not like page  that is like being christian and not liking jesus  my friend was like  led zeppelin sucks  and i was like   oh yeah  watch this  after about   mins of watching page pick through  white summer black mountain side  he was glued to the screen and has never said a bad thing about zeppelin since   incase you haven t been following the running metaphor i am calling this dvd the bible of led zeppelin  held high by the followers and used as a converter for the unwashed heathens   course there are some things missing like  over the hills and far away  a good version of  immigrant song  and i really didn t need   version of  whole lotta love  but what the hell  i ll take  em   because there is nothing besides  the song remains the same  to compare this too i gave it a   and even if there were more to compare it too i still would have given it a
