  a space odyssey  is set in   and the main character is hal  a computer  that s right  a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own  this was made in   and to think by   it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke  if this was in   a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this  there is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion  it provokes two reactions and one is called  sleep  it starts with nothing  but a pitch black shot for well over two minutes  then  the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is  the dawn of man  sequence  so  if it s in chronological order  the blackness prior to this  is the birth of the world    during  the dawn of man  sequence out of no where  a huge monolith comes from
 out of the ground  from the sky  we ll never know where it comes from  but for one reason or another it s there  the monkeys go apesh t once they find this monolith that only man could have made  but that s the catch
 man hasn t evolved yet  so  who made it and where did it come from  what is its purpose  the monkeys find a tool  the monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys  the monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group because they have used their mind to gain an advantage  the more advanced monkeys  and more importantly smarter and more innovative monkeys  are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole   we quickly jump into space  millions of years later  where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music  we can see the earth  the moon  the sun  the universe and for a film made in   the visual effects are stunning  but outdated  the score is legendary  the cinematography is spectacular  the editing is atrocious  there are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for  what feels like  an infinite amount of time  once we board the ship there isn t much to talk about  for the next hour kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space  kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut  which is very boring  and we completely get the message  the spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking  remember what the first cell phone looked like  me neither  but that s what the future looks like in   all the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble   the chairs are decorated in bright red colors and oddly shaped because we all know  in the future  we re going to be sitting in weird looking chairs  the computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to hdtv because the clarity is atrocious  all the tv sets look like they re from   so it s not all that futuristic  like all films set more than   years in advance  they look terrible and unconvincing  just because this is kubrick  we shouldn t say   well  that s how you would think it looks  no  i wouldn t  just  like i wouldn t think a computer would be talking to me in the year   it s not going to happen and if someone made a film right now  set   years in time and had a talking  self thinking computer  i would laugh at the stupidity of it  just like i did with     hal is the liveliest person  shoot
 i just called him a person  hal is a computer  but he has more life than any of the muted characters in the film and he actually thinks he s alive  hal is the only thing that s lively and he sees the humans as his maintenance men taking care of him while he does all the work  hal  reads  the lips  of one of the very few conversations between dave and frank  and he  sees  that they are planning to turn him off  this is where the only dramatic part of the film enters  an ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into the bigger spaceship  oh  the drama  once hal thinks he has the upper hand  dave makes his way back into the spaceship  proving mans ingenuity  dave proceeds to terminate hal  hal  pleads for his life as he slowly fades away  which  like everything else  seems to take forever   the final act is just as tedious as the first two  once again  the monolith that the apes found appears at the end  it comes out of nowhere  again  then  an infant is born in a placenta like shield overlooking the earth from space  what is kubrick saying  is it about transformation  dave to an infant  is man evolving again  is kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of
 whatever that alien looking thing is  maybe i m going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say  but the more i think about the more the beginning and the ending make sense  there are so many questions left unanswered  especially for the purpose of the monolith  if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought    in the end the film struggles with getting to where it wants go  the first act and the third acts are strong  but the second act meanders around  hovering in one place for what seems like eternity  there is some intriguing stuff in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance  once the start of the film makes sense the ending works much better  even if you still don t what kubrick is trying to say  which i don t
