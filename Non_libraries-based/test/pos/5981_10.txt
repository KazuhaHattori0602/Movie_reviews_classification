this is one of the very  very few films that are so overwhelming that you are very unlikely to watch it more than once or twice in your lifetime  other examples are claude lanzmann s documentary shoah and come and see by the director s husband elem klimov   which covers much the same unbearable territory but in a very different way   i suppose this is just as well given the difficulty of ever seeing a print   apparently it s extraordinarily overt christian symbolism and admission that there were active russian collaborators  ensured that it was hardly ever seen in the ussr   and of course post soviet russia has very little interest in films of that era   the one time i saw it in london was in a festival of russian movies shown during the glasnost era  i e  probably c    however it apparently has been shown several times in the uk more recently so at least one subtitled print must exist here   as far as i know it has never been released in the west on dvd or video so if you haven t seen it  your best chance is probably to join a film society and endlessly nag them to find a print and screen it
