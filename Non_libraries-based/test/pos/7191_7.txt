in the original french version  the jokes of num robis  great  funny voice   jamel debbrouze  are very funny   but in translated versions  i saw the german   english version  it s not half good than the original   but  goof special effects  almost the full comic  with differences  like the figure of l gnix  german name  is placed in an other comic book   sure  the asterix comic book are cult  but when you watch the animated comic movies from   to   you will see much better jokes  better story and the old  charme  and  flair  of the cult stories   for french speaking people i suggest to watch it in it s original version  with or without subtitles  where available in different languages
