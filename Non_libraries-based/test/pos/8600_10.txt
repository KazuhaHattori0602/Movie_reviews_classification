   but only in comparison to volker schlondorff s magnificent  tin drum  another film dealing with monumental human folly and global catastrophe  moreover  it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before  it is in the light of the recent weather calamity that devastated our country that i was prompted to re visit and write something again about this remarkable imamura film  as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the imperfections and dangers of scientific knowledge and action  and the long term scars and wounds inflicted by a wide  scale destruction  whether human  or nature induced   there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction  testament   threads   the war game  each situated within their own respective countries and  black rain  stands among them  if not more so  for both its unapologetic and somber portrayal of individual and communal disintegration brought about by atomic devastation and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis   few weeks from now  another disaster film from hollywood  roland emmerich s   will finally hit  no pun intended  the big screen  as we all know  this american director s bunch of  disaster apocalypse  films independence day   godzilla   the day after tomorrow  serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value  with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected  i wonder how this  gigantic  movie would exploit the trauma  disorientation and apprehensions still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather calamity  to say that this flick is a precautionary tale would probably be no more than an overstatement    but yes  i will still watch
