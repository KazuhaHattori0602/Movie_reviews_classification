an orphan boy named tom  tommy pender  who works for a pair of shady chimney sweeps  is falsely accused of stealing from the mansion where he is working at by mr  grimes  james mason    the real thief   and goes on the run  tom s only alibi is the niece of the mansion s owners  samantha gates  a slender  blue eyed blonde  with long  wavy hair  who i m sure was the primary reason why i repeatedly watched this as a boy  he and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into water breathing cartoon characters  while underwater  he befriends and rescues a group of water breathing children known as water babies from a shark   a very interesting and always fascinating fable  set in   that should appeal to all children  the animation   minutes of the   minute hbo vhs print  is just average  but it s preferable to most modern day animation   even computer animation  my only real gripe is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene  at   after the first verse of  high cockalorum  the film cuts to a scene with octopi swimming  followed by tom and jacque s encounter with terence  this leads to a scene in which the killer shark  voiced by mason  leads our heroes into a trap  the shark then greets tom with   young tom  so nice to see your ugly mug again    but this is the first time in hbo s print that tom meets the shark  most reference books list the running time as   or   minutes  and it was previously available from sultan entertainment and nelson  so it s very likely that hbo s print is edited and   or time compressed  adding insult to injury  mgm released a fullscreen    minute print on dvd in   let s hope a restored version appears in the near future   the film is copyright ariadne films    ariadne  is the water baby voiced by samantha gates  bernard cribbins  who plays mason s partner in crime  also voices the electric eel  a k a  slip slide adventures
