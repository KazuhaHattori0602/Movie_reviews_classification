this film had some very funny moments  the aforementioned feeb sketch for starters    the parts where rik tries to act dignified in front of his guests  looking down at them through his nose  very subtly done  especially as the guest was a toffee nosed adulterer himself   the scene where rik finds out that gina has a fianc   ahhh  she was stringing me along all the time  the brazen hussy  with his   candle eyes  like as if she really fancied him  but he believed it  that s why it was so funny  great moment    gino was also excellent  he should have been used more as the bad man   where are the whores i ordered  he bellows  brilliant stuff
