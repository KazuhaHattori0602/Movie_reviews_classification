when i saw this movie at age   it was in the childrens  section at erols video because it was animation  we watched it and it was a whole different ball game  a very violent story and graphic deaths are very entertaining and compelling  but not for children  avoid for family viewing  my mom nearly had a heart attack and ripped the video apart
