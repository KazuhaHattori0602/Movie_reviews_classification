some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure  i loved this flick but i don t feel guilty about it  you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie  but jack frost   won t go over well with some people  right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it  well  if you get the privilege to watch this movie  after watching it remember that jack frost   revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure  not a guilty pleasure  now  because i can t fill up ten lines heres some great scenes     spoilers    the three women on the beach had great deaths  the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them  he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her  the next woman fell on a bed of icicles  the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongs   the other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole  one of them gets their tongue stuck on it  of course  jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying  cowa tongue a dude  well  you have to see it for yourself   and of course  the snowball children kicked ass    end spoilers   infinity stars
