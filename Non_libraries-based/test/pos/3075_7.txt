might contain spoilers   this is just a good movie  lots of good silly stuff to laugh at  however  do not watch the tv version  they cut to much out  dom deluise is rather awesome as the mafia don who is hired to kill robin  all i can say about his ten minutes  it s a long drive from jersey  also you gotta love them checking the script to make sure robin gets another shot  also   th century fox   any bad stuff  the rappers at the beginning and the end seem rather out dated  the songs were rather lame  one time while watching this movie  i could think out a few more times when they could have thrown in another joke or     on the whole  however  an enjoyable movie experience  a must watch for comedy fans
