night of the demons is definitely one the definitive cheesy  s demons horror flick in the same vein as the brilliant evil dead and demons movies  this movie combines boozy sexually active teens and demons into one hell of a fun movie  a definite welcome addition after the  s were overrun by slasher flicks  it was nice to see something a little different   the plot follows a group of teens who all meet up for a halloween party at hull house which used to be funeral parlour  hosted by angela  about  minutes of boozing and sexing eventually leads to a demon or demons finding their way out of the furnace and possessing each and every one of the teens  add some snazzy make up effects  lots of gore  and cool looking demons and you ve got yourself a sweet  s cheese fest that would be ranked as one of the best demon related films in many horror fans  lists   firstly i loved the setting for this movie   hull house  is really creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons emerge  that s when the action really kicks in and it becomes a night of terror and fear  this movie spawned   sequels  the first one in   which was okay but nothing come pared to this and the third one titled demon house was absolutely horrendous  this is one of those horrors that has definitely stood the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come   all in all a fun cheesy flick with demons that s definitely worth checking out
