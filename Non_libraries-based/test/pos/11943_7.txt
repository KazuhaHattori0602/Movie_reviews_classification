this is a nice little lifetime movie about a guy  peter coyote  who s living the perfect suburban middle class life when late one night the police suddenly bust into his home and arrest him for the murder of some guy   years ago   in his prison cell coyote recounts to his wife the fateful events of   years ago and how he came into contact with wayne kennedy the man who he supposedly killed   from here the story is told in flashback fashion and the more you learn about wayne and coyote and how they came to meet and what happened when they did the more interested you get   the acting isn t anything to crow about  although the guy who plays wayne kennedy is pretty creepy enough  the real strong point of the movie is that mystery of what actually happened on the mountain  the wife spends the movie running around digging up clues to the mystery and each time something new comes up we are treated with another flashback revealing more of the mystery  it s actually pretty well   so as far as lifetime tv movie s go this little flick comes highly recommended   enjoy
