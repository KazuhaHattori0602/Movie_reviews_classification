i m certain that people from usa don t know anything about the rest of the world  but i think they mustn t talk about what they don t know  and they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the usa  the only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the usa and islamic nations  in france  for instance  the age of consent is   in brazil it s   in spain it s   so the teenagers actors    and   years old by the time of production  aren t doing anything illegal  nudity isn t considered big deal in almost all civilized countries  and only a freak could consider a teenagers  love as child molestation
