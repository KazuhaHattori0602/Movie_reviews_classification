well i have to say i had the chance to see this show here in philadelphia pa sometime in june of  and i really loved it my all time favorite madonna look was the   blond ambition tour era this to me is  madonna now that she is a mother of   she has to change some things to suit motherhood and i totally agree this is a classic madonna concert i wish  live to tell  wasn t edited we saw body s falling from buildings on  we can see a woman on a cross any way i m looking forward to the release of this tour on dvd and hope it is the entire show unedited and with a bunch of bonus footage she is a artist of all time the best out there and still at the top and going strong long live madonna
