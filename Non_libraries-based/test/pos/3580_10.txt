an stunning look at the ocean and the life in it   the good   the camera work was absolutely phenomenal  every shot is done beautifully   it was interesting seeing all the different animals that i could have never even imagined   david attenborough has the perfect narrator s voice  no one could have done any better   the bad   there were one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth being   million years old   i hold a different belief    overall a tv series anyone can enjoy  i highly recommend buying it    stars
