some people think this was a rather bad tv series  with cheesy effects   considering it was filmed between   but really  look back at those years and think   we didn t have computers back then  so if you think about it  it s a rather good tv series   i always figured bad ratings killed the show  but no  the network did  they canceled out their theme as  the superhero network  and abandoned a short lived spider man series  if it had gone on  it probably would have run well into the  s  and if it was really lucky  and i mean really lucky  the early  s   and no one wanted to pick this series up   anyways  jolly old  or young  nicholas hammond  of the sound of music fame  is brought to the tv screen as peter parker  the secret identity of the amazing spider man  along the series  peter deals with a clone  a beautiful girl from a foreign country  and a corrupt politician   while the series is way out of timeline  being that peter is already graduated from university  and thats when he gets bit  and uncle ben is already dead  the audience is treated to action  suspense  and the attitude that the characters have towards peter and his alter ego  spider man   while it s also slightly disappointing that robert  f simon looks nothing like j j jameson  it s not so disappointing that betty grant isn t betty grant  but a hot african american girl  who reminds me of halle berry  who is one of the hottest women on the planet  so really  this one wasn t so bad   but considering the time  and how much drama they packed into this one  it kind of foreshadows what bad tv is today  either way  it s entertaining  even for today
