a mixture of alien and ghost busters   starts very promising  then slows down to almost boring    lifeforce contains some awesome special effects they were able to make in the mid  s  the story is intriguing  but becomes quite lack lustre in the end  it was rated r because of the nudeness  sex and gore  mathilda may s ethereal and savage  naked  beauty is very apparent through out the whole movie  a bizarre movie and cost a lot by the time it was made    this could have been a bigger classic with a better script  but unfortunately it wasn t a great hit  i think it actually flopped quite bad    so  something went wrong with this one  but still  it s very entertaining
