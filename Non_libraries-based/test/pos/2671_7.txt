it s sometimes difficult to watch such self avowed  message films  from an earlier  seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism  the issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that has been drummed into us from an early age  and  as we ve grown  teachers and authority figures have sought out less blatant yet equally effective means of getting the message across   the house i live in   is about as unsubtle as  message films  come  and frank sinatra seems to be treating his audience like a child   indeed  perhaps this was the point  as the short was no doubt intended primarily to influence younger film goers  even so  i found myself curiously affected when sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an american
 and i m not even an american  released just two months after the end of wwii  director mervyn leroy greeted war weary audiences with a message of tolerance  togetherness and  above all else  hope  the music ain t bad  either   fresh faced frank sinatra   already a star  but not yet the superstar he d become   opens the film in a recording studio  booming out  if you are but a dream  with a full orchestral accompaniment  when  between songs  frank goes outside for a smoko  he observes a large group of kids bullying a young jewish boy  their taunts provoked purely by his differing religion  ol  blue eyes quickly puts a stop to this childish behaviour  delicately branding the bullies  nazi werewolves  and scolding their irrational prejudice  he then earnestly and good naturely lectures the group on the plain silliness of racial and religious discrimination  assuring them that every american culture  however it differs from our own  is still american at heart
 unless  of course  you re one of those bloody  japs  there s a hint of hypocrisy in pleading for racial tolerance while presenting one nation as the collective enemy  though you could hardly blame hollywood for being less than enthusiastic about the plight of the japanese in    sinatra drives his point home with a wonderfully heartwarming rendition of  the house i live in  which was written in   by abel meeropol  when the songwriter first heard the song on film  he was furious that the filmmakers had completely excluded three of his verses  which he considered crucial to the message  these omissions were most likely due to time restraints  but meeropol understandably didn t take too kindly to them  and reportedly had to be ejected from the cinema  when it was first released   the house i live in  was deemed such an important short film that it won a golden globe for  best film for promoting international good will  and a honorary oscar for all involved  in   it was judged to be  culturally  historically or aesthetically significant  and added to the library of congress  national film registry  which is how i came to hear of it  while its approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later  this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young fella named frank sinatra
