i have seen this movie three times  going back to vcr s  in the  s  and again on the encor channel last night  feb    based on a true story which i remember being in the news  during the early  s  i ve decided that i find it too disturbing to watch ever again  yet it s hard to look away from a car accident  the creepiest character is joshua john miller  who plays keeanu reeves little brother     the story this movie was based on can be found anywhere on the internet   just google it  it s about anthony jacques broussard who murdered marcy conrad in milpitas  california  in   the characters portray generation x pre grunge  borderline sociopaths  with the exception of keeanu reeves  who grows a conscience   old hippies did a great job raising that generation   for such a young kid  i thought joshua miller was excellent  as the serial killer in the making character  in actuality  he went to yale  and has written screenplays as well as directed  his acting capabilities in this film were amazing  just the way he treats his little sister by drowning her doll  and tearing up her dolls grave  gave me the shivers  it gave me nightmares  even with whats happening in our world today  in   it still is the most degenerate film i ve seen to date    the apathy  and dysfunction  of these families  is enough to make one puke  this thrill kill almost makes the manson murders pale in comparison    crispon glover got a little too much into character  he wound up on david lettermen to discuss his role  and almost kicked the host in the head  apparrently glover had to seek psychiatric help after portraying his character    also  fight the good fight to the great dennis hopper  you re one of the best
