betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdi s macbeth  when a car mysteriously hits the lead  betty is thrust into the spotlight  opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend  but when the boyfriend leaves the room  betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black gloved  masked figure  the unknown assailant ties betty to a column  gags her  and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them  the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament  he s even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force  the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth  and betty has been forced to watch all of this  so begins betty s terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her  but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friends   opera gets classified as a giallo  but to me  it differs in quite a few ways from the model  less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argento s tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage  the black gloved  masked killer may be omnipresent  but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent  instead  opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable  the focus is on the grisly death scenes  betty s fear  and the killer s obsession with betty   opera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes  when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room  you re sure that betty s had it  but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck   the knife emerging in his mouth  it s a well shot and designed scene  and those needles in the eyes   brilliant  or  take the death of the seamstress  at first her death seems like an ordinary  run of the mill murder  but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killer s locket  what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girl s throat open to get his chain  finally  there s the most famous death scene in opera that i m amazed with each time i see it   mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole  that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento  it s got style to burn  as implausible as it may be  it s creative  memorable  and a blast to watch   argento certainly wasn t the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation  but in opera  he s taken eye trauma to a new level  needles holding eyes open  a bullet in the eye  and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argento s vision  pun intended  and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for  the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in betty s eyes  i couldn t stop blinking  it actually had a physical effect on me  what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films    to be fair  and not sound like such a fanboy  there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argento s best  one of my problems is with the air duct system running through betty s apartment building  while i don t doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments  the ducts in opera are huge  i m no expert  but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts  it doesn t seem practical at all  and don t you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments  it s convenient for the plot  but it s not very realistic   but i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale  what s up with that ending  it feels totally out of place  tacked on  and like a bad afterthought  i m not sure what else to say other than it s horrible
