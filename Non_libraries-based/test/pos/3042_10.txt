i saw this film on tv in the uk some   years ago and it has resonated with me ever since  my interest has recently been rekindled by visiting hilton head   the next island over from  yamacraw   daufuskie actually  and reading pat conroy s excellent  the water is wide  with the benefit of knowledge i have reappraised conrack and consider it a masterpiece  jon voight captures the spirit of conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book to life with some accuracy   a hollywood rarity    three things still strike me about this tale    the issues of educating the poor and disenfranchised and being inclusive remain the same    education is about more than reading and writing    these kids were my peers  i was   in   when pat conroy spent his year on daufuskie   why this has not made it on to dvd yet
