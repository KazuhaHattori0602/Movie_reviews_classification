i can t say that i embrace this as a romantic comedy  as i found little funny about it  i did find it endearing  entertaining  heartwarming  and terminally sweet  and while there were some witty moments  i found them more bittersweet than outright comedic   i liked this one  barrymore has grown so much as an actress  and it s always wonderful to catch her on the big screen  but this translates well to the small screen  too  in fact  on subsequent viewings  i like this one more and more   if you re a fan of the romantic comedy  then you may be a bit put off by lack of comedic effect with this one  but if you re in it for the romance  it s definitely here to be found   it rates a   from   the fiend
