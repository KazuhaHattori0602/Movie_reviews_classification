black rain is a superb film  but watch out for the dvds currently being sold for as much as   apiece  i have the dvd  and it s terrible  very tiny non anamorphic image that has to be blown up to resolution killing size  acceptable sound  this is a primitive dvd that absolutely  has  to be rereleased   btw  i also own the laserdisc and the vhs of black rain  the vhs is a huge step upward from the dvd  and the laserdisc has far and away the best picture of them all subtitles in the black  sharp  big picture  simple but very good soundtrack  buy the vhs and avoid the preposterous prices these scam artists are demanding
