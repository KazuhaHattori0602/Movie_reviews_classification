following is a little known   british film  which was made with a budget of   and has a running time of   minutes  when watching it  you d never expect its director to go on to make it in hollywood and become one of the most acclaimed and celebrated directors of the  st century   well  everybody has to start somewhere i suppose   the director of following  as you probably already know is englishman christopher nolan  who directly after following would go on to direct the critically acclaimed independent film memento  a few years later he would be hired by warner bros  to direct the new batman series  which further brought him acclaim  and so on and so forth  my point is  everybody has to start somewhere   even if it s not in the most astounding debut   and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in   with following   when watching it  i couldn t help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut  avant garde auteur david lynch s eraserhead  following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense  but the similarities are noticeable  most notable  it s shot in grainy black and white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique  it s hard to describe in words  but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you d find in the film noirs of old  hence  it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir  or a neo noir  overall  it s an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller  and the story is most appropriate to these two genres   the main character is nameless  and the movie s title stems from an early  obsessive compulsive trait he possessed   randomly picking out people on the street and following them  sometimes even for hours on end  during one of these  stalking expeditions  the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following  and is confronted  turns out that the  confronter  is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator  and he introduces himself  his name is cobb  and he s a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglaries   from there  the main character becomes swept up in cobb s world  and he becomes embroiled in crime  passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb  following is not so much a character study  but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters  and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator  nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir  and emulates the respective atmosphere well   as a thriller  following is taut and atmospheric  however as a film in general  it s somewhat of a disappointment  if not that  then one could definitely call it underwhelming  the entire film is shot in a non chronological and non linear fashion  and it makes the story and film experience unique  to some extent   this style has been done so many times now it s almost commonplace technique   and the story itself is unique to some extent   however  following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film  and is disappointingly unspectacular  the story calls for more   more action  more suspense and more thrills   but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline  and instead focuses on creating an intricate story  following does succeed in doing that  but without any other elements it s a film noir that doesn t quite work out  it s got a sense of emptiness which isn t enormous  but still noticeable nonetheless  furthermore  the film s shocking revelation at the end   almost a mandatory convention in film noirs   is one that makes us feel cheated  it s unpredictable and comes out of nowhere  but in relation to the story it s disappointing  as it essentially makes the preceding scenes  and the entire film  seem like an enormous waste of time   but the positives far outweigh the negatives  and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film  yes  everybody has to start somewhere  christopher nolan does it with following  and he does it in a fine manner  a quiet  meek but fine manner  it s not the most astounding movie  and it isn t quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade  but it s still a good film nonetheless  when singling out following  you find a well made  taut and atmospheric thriller  one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless
