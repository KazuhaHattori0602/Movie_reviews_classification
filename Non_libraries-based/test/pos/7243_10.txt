i totally agree with the other poster  nemesis is one of the best of the christie adaptations with a superlative plot and cast   the scene involving liz fraser as the mother of the murder victim is a study in acting at the finest level  this underrated woman was a fave in brit films in the  s who never got a mainstream break in us films  check her out as julie andrews s friend in the   the americanization of emily   all of the perfs in this prod have a chance to shine with and without the peerless ms  hickson who was never nommed for an emmy for her marple work  shame on them  and dig the lesbian cid agents
