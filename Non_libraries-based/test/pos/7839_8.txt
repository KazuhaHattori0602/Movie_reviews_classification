first of all i d like to start by saying it s a refreshing start to see a british drama that finally looks and feels believable    patrick stewart does the role justice as  ian hood  the government science adviser  with his constant and unwavering views on authority and thoughts about the future of  real world  science and how he feels it s either being used or abused by others    not only is the casting thoroughly maintained all the way throughout the series  but it makes it s characters seem more believable than most other british drama s    ashley jensen also delivers a first rate performance as dr  hood s appointed bodyguard  rachael young  she brings a refreshing take on the unscientific  uninterested everyday views of science  and her constant battling with hood makes for some very funny and memorable moments between them   the way the series keeps all the scientific elements more realistic i find positive and more engaging than the psychobabble we are so used to in other fiction or science fiction tv shows    there are however notable disappointments with the series  every time an episode ends i find myself disappointed that they didn t seem to cover all aspects of the plot and sometimes leaving open ended stories unclosed    although bearing in mind that this is still the first series  i hope that we see a return to form in the near future where these open ended stories can finally be given a significant conclusion they so rightly deserve   for those who enjoy more slow paced science related plot lines  this is the ideal show to watch as it always manages to stay believable and more importantly to the point
