this is the type of film that may need to be viewed several times to capture all of its beauty and intelligence   just like curse of frankenstein from     if you don t like odd  non mainstream films  steer clear of this masterpiece  for me  the artwork alone in this film is worth the purchase price of the videocassete  the storyline is a bit fantastic but seems to becoming reality in our world today  for being produced in the  s  this film is proving to be a prophetic vision of whats to come with big government and big brother wanting to control and monitor us   there are many slow sections and the dialog can be quite hard to catch in many scenes   thats why i ve watched it   times now  but if you can digest it all  it may prove to be well worth your time   the film is basically about a world where people have evolved into robotic machines that have lost their individualism   they are only concerned about accumulating and procreating  the hero of the film has not succumb to this sickness and has not been   tagged  and monitored by big brother  his mission is to release a secret drug into the water supply which will change the way the human robots think and allow individulaism to once again be a part of humanity   yes  its very low budget  but for its time the computer effects and sound effects are very unique and the paintings are utterly fascinating  if you have an open mind  this film should impress and its prophetic visions are chilling
