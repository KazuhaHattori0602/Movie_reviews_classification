i saw this movie when it first came out in   and loved it  since then i ve searched for a video but never found it until now    years later  when i ordered it from moviehunter  sorry to say it doesn t hold up  this glamourized version just can t rise up to the   production level  i love burt bacharach s musical score  that is if listend to by itself  and i even bought a cd of it  but for my taste it doesn t lend itself well to this mysterious and compelling story  just doesn t fit  michael york is lost here  sally kellerman tosses off a fine performance but olivia hussy is just ridiculous and not worth lugging through the himalayas  the best performance is charles boyer as the head lama
