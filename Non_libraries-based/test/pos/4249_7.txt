sure  the film is full of black militant stereotypes and much of the jargon of the time  in that sense  the movie has indeed dated  but as a satirical look at america s number one parasitical industry  advertising  it s still on target  but just as important is the counter  message  namely the effect of big bucks on those who would make the industry more socially responsible no promoting war toys  alcohol  etc  thus  the movie s also about the allures of capitalism  note  for example  how putney s garb suddenly changes to resemble third world revolutionary fidel s  just before he pulls out of the firm  for a moment  it looks like swope s mini revolution has succeeded among his staff  and he s moving on  maybe to spread the movement  but then  the former militants succumb to the allure of big bucks and he departs shaking his head  perhaps to hijack a plane to cuba  downey s final word  however  is an ironical one as the arab  i believe  burns down the money tower leaving the metaphorical structure of  advertising  capitalism  a smoking ruin  to me  this looks like change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reform a message consistent with the radical spirit of the time   whatever the subtext  there are some genuinely funny moments  especially with the commercials that play as well now as they did then  those who compare the anarchic style to that of the marx bros  make a good point  the throw away lines fly thick and fast along with the outrageous set ups  forty years later  it s still a hard movie to get a consistent handle on  despite the crudities  however  the film remains a work of daring originality with some genuinely telling moments
