so let s begin   the movie itself is as original as cronenberg s movies would usually appear   my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses  she is as lovely as usual  this cutie   i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers  still it s quite interesting and entertaining to follow    the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array     recommend with confidence
