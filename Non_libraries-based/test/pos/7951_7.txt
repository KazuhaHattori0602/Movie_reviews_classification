i watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed  although i like this film and was engrossed by the story  i did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat   the story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic policewoman  the location is a quaint korean village    this film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic  however i was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman  yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life  in my mind he is a sweet  noble loser   good points   excellent acting by the two main leads  enjoyable snapshot of village life  cons   flat ending  overall   good but i prefer the before sunrise and after sunset films  or is it before sunset and after sunrise
