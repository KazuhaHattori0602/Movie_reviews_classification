this review contains some small  yet significant  spoilers      i just finished watching my copy of noroi    and it was great  this might sound cheesy  but several times during the film i forgot it wasn t real xd the acting is convincing  although the acting from masafumi kobayashi  playing himself  i think  seems a bit hokey at times  marika matsumoto  yuka in takashi shimizu s rinne  seemed to change levels of believability throughout the movie  sometimes she s really good  then the next moment she s really cheesy  especially at the end s exorcism and subsequent re possession   a character that was ridiculous at first was mr  hori  a man covered in tinfoil believing  ectoplasmic worms  are coming to eat everyone  he provides unintentional comic relief at the beginning  acting like the stereotypical alien abduction type victim  but near the end has some really creepy scenes   the plot was very interesting and really kept me wondering how everything tied together  there are some things that aren t really explained  like a mass suicide in a tokyo park and where the reincarnated kagutaba boy came from  but everything else turned out fine  the ending has got to be one of the most unnerving  if not the scariest  sequences i ve ever had the pleasure to witness   all in all  noroi is a very fun way to spend   hours and the new hong kong r  dvd provides great picture and sound  most importantly the english subtitles  engrish free  for a great j horror experience  i highly recommend picking it up
