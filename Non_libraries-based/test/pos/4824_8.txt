i saw part of this film on the sci fi channel  but missed the ending  i bought the dvd to see the whole movie  and i m glad i did   a young mother and her two daughters move into a house out in a backwoods area that they inherited from the husband  who died from an illness  it s very run down  but the three women make the best of it  the teen daughter  scout taylor compton  is warned by a local boy about the zombies that come out at night  she ignores him  but since he has a cute friend  she joins his group  meanwhile  the younger daughter  chloe grace moretz  makes a friend in a zombie girl her age named mary  it turns out that mary and several other kids died in a mine in   while working as child labor  now that they are zombies  they attack and kill anyone who s not a blood relative    this movie was directed by j s  cardone  whose previous films include the slayer   and shadowzone   two movies i didn t like in the slightest bit  this is why i was surprised that i actually enjoyed this movie  the film is deliberately paced  which i liked  this allows you to get to know the main characters  most of whom are likable  child zombies have been used at least since george romero s   classic night of the living dead  still  i found the tool using child zombies in this movie interesting  it would seem that cardone finally found the right script and cast  only the stereotypical scenes of the teens smoking  drinking and making out in a parked car were boring to me   taylor compton also appears in the halloween remake  moretz appeared in the amityville horror   and the horror film room
