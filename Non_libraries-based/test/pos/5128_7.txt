this is a good family movie with a few laughs  i wish it didn t have too much of the school stuff like the bully in it to fill the movie up  also  it seems a little too easy to save a piece of land from being built  i mean  the it just flowed too easily  it does make you aware of the wildlife  it had a cute way of introducing the piece of land which the fast runner but a little too slow for me  a little too hokey for me and it reminded me of going back to school  oh  the dvd is chock full of goodies so don t miss out    out of   for the movie   out   for the dvd with the extras that is well worth to watch  well worth your time to see this
