hallelujah  
finally  a true colombian film crosses the border s  to shows how bogot  and colombia really are  i am an american of colombian and french heritage sick and tired of seeing colombia so perversely and ignorantly portrayed by hollywood and others   how many of you are aware that colombia is the second oldest  uninterrupted democracy in the world  after the usa  or that it has a vibrant film and television industry  to say nothing of ugly betty  that it s capital  bogota  pop    million  is the  world capital of the book  or that this beautiful city is host to the world s largest international theatre festival  i hope that doug liman  simon kinberg  mr    mrs  smith  robert zemeckis  diane thomas  romancing the stone  one day visit bogot  to see how wonderful it really is  and focus on bogot s cultural vitality and diversity  instead of myopically producing films such as maria full of grace from which joshua marston profited greatly  for this terrific film  without ever thinking through about the ontological damage his film would help to perpetuate upon the  unfairly tarnished image  of colombia    anyway  you will at least enjoy bluff very much   oh  and thanks imdb for your invaluable great work
