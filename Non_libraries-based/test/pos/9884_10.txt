take someone you love or want to love and go see this film   it touches you in all the right places   all the other reviewers here have said it all   perhaps the cynical will not be impressed   they only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days   this film is ga run teed to stay with you for life   i am so gratified that the director is not usc trained   this validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days   it is because of the usc lockstep mentality and inbreeding   hooray for jeff hare and richard marcus  cast and crew  well done
