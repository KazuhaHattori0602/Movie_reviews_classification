i have just watched the season   finale of doctor who  and apart from a couple of dull episodes this show is fantastic   its a sad loss that we say goodbye to a main character once again in the season final but the show moves on   the bbc does need to increase the budget on the show  there are only so many things that can happen in london and the surrounding areas  also some of the special effects all though on the main very good  on the odd occasion do need to be a little more polished   it was a huge gamble for the bbc to bring back a show that lost its way a long time ago and they must be congratulated for doing so   roll on to the christmas   special  the   christmas special was by far the best thing on television
