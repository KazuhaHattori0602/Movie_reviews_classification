does anyone know where i could get my hands on this video or the film for this  i have been searching for it for a long time to show my daughter to show her and i can not find it anywhere  probably because it was only on video and they never made the dvd or vhs or idk   i saw this right off disney back in   and i think it would be the best video to show her  such a good movie that has every type of emotion displayed throughout the whole movie  also has a lot of actors that started their careers with this movie  if anyone knows how to get a copy of this movie or has a copy and willing to sell it to me for like   bucks or something  please call   thank you
