in order to pull off a job like this caper in rififi  e g  the score and its opines  one has to have nerves of steel  this one apparently demands and commands it  jules dassin is the master   i was on the edge of my seat throughout  it deserves to be better known  even though it was not at the time of its release in   due  one supposes  to the director being blacklisted in the hypocritical hollywood of its day   i would recommend this film to anyone who has not has the pleasure of seeing it   i cannot give it enough stars
