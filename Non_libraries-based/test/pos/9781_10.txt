my family and i enjoy this show and find it a fair thumb nail sketch of what the people went through   my own father spent some time in changi before going onto the thailand burma railway in  f  force  much as been said about the treatment the pow s received  i will just say that my father was   foot   inch and   lbs when singapore fell  at the end of the war he was   foot   inches tall and   lbs   no show could truly convey what the pow s went through  but this comes closer than most   as the ex pow s say   if you didn t have mates you didn t survive  this show succeeds in getting this message across
