this sad romance is untellable because the director decides to break its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters  so  there are a lot of flashbacks  of re shooting of the same scene  but  it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result    and it would worth it  because it s for me  just one the best french movie ever made    it has everything    cast  first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel  such a presence and such voices  even for a hard of hearing  it s symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this movie   directing  his camera is bright  alive  plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close up   la david lynch   cinematography  the light is beautiful  between gold and rust  like their love   a never seen before paris  it s a paris out of time of more accurately  a composite of a lot of districts  huge search here  it s look like gotham city  modern and old at the same time    music  not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames  and the song of charles aznavour made me discover this great singer    ah  
 the story  as i said  it s a love story but rather tragic  saying that love can be for nothing  that it doesn t make all people happy or isn t guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message isn t often told  love is passion  which is derivative from the latin  pain  you can suffer a lot when you are in love  because of the why     of the endless waiting  the lack of courage  the indecision    and when you can ease yourself  fate  destiny  god   devil   can stab you in the back   just because you arrive too soon or too late  and above all  because love means   in a world of billions  a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written  so  what s love    personally  i lived some moments like this  in a car with the dear one  her mobile rings and you know it s her  special friend  whom she kisses goodbye  and not you  even if we are always together  so  you want to go out of this car to leave them together  to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you can t  because an amazing hard rain just started    i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else
