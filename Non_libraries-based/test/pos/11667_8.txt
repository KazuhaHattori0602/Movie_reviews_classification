 it s easy to kill a monster  but it s hard to kill a human being   set in st  thomas housing project and angola prison in new orleans   dead man walking  is the true story of helen prejean  susan sarandon  a louisiana nun sister who befriended matthew poncelet  sean penn  a murderer and a rapist bound for a lethal injection machine for killing a teenage couple
 sister helen agrees to help the convict and to remain with him till the end an act never before attempted by a woman
   at their first meeting  poncelet swears to the nun that his accomplice was the one who shot both of the kids and pleads her help for a new trial in order to convince the pardon board hearing to spare his life
   the film challenges the audience to actually give some thought to the human consequences of the death penalty  but gives voice to angry bereaved parents whose kids were shot  stabbed  raped  and left in the woods to die alone
   as poncelet s execution looms closer and closer  his character is seen deceptively complex  harboring doubts about the rightness of what they were doing to him
 in one moment  we hear him sensitive asking for a lie detector test to let his mother know that he is innocent  in another we see him furious playing the victim  blaming the government  drugs  blacks  the kids for being there
 poncelet never understood that he has robbed the percys and the delacroixs so much  giving them nothing but sorrow
 they are never going to see their children again  never going to hold them  to love them  to laugh with them
   in the scenes leading up to his execution  the death row inmate drops his terrible facade and reveals his identity
 luckily both sarandon and penn are here exceptional carrying out successfully an exquisite  tangible harmony of souls
 when sarandon was looking at penn  she was projecting compassionate eyes brimming with tears
 she asks him to visualize her as he dies   i want the last thing you see in this world to be the face of love in that moment  we truly believed that she ll be the face of love for him
