this review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie was   saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants  like my italian grandparents who came through ellis island at the turn of the last century  would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter america   it was certainly eye opening  since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there  my grandmother was  years old and my grandfather   when they arrived   i just returned from a trip to new york where i had the pleasure of visiting ellis island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process   the filmmaker obviously did his research  right down to the medical exams and equipment  questions and puzzles  they are all there at the museum  even the wedding pictures and the review board room   factually correct  anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie  inspirational to say the least
