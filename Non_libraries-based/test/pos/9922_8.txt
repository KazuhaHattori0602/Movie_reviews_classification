this is standard fare from a director who as long been amongst my favourites   even though its very flat in comparison to a lot of his other work but its argento and this may be biased but i m gonna be giving it a good review anyway   it does contain a lot of good ideas  the subtle voyeuristic element  the needles under the eyes  the gory and disturbing deaths  and the argento clich  flashback   downsides include the heavy metal soundtrack  acting and the ending   all the film is made worth it for the birds in the theatre sequence near the end   a fairly good film from argento but he as done better  a lot better
