spoiler alert   although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain    mulholland drive  is by far the most successful expression of david lynch s cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his  twin peaks  tv series  as lynch enthusiasts know  his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir  horror movies  surrealism  and parapsychology   with a healthy dose of postmodern self consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure  all these elements are richly at work in  mulholland drive  making for a riveting  hair raising  and highly satisfying film experience   especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical  mystery unraveling whole   the film features wonderful performances by naomi watts and laura harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality  retro  s nostalgia  and satirical self aggrandizement  their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film s opening scene  in which harring s character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous  not to mention horrific  automobile accident  staggering down the hillside from mulholland drive to sunset boulevard  the two most archetypal of hollywood thoroughfares  she finds her way to the very apartment that betty  naomi watts  is about to sublet from her  aunt ruth  a purportedly successful actress who is off to canada to begin a new movie  as we later learn  betty had herself arrived from deep river  ontario  shortly after winning a jitterbug contest   a highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre credit prologue sequences that frame betty s descent from the clich d would be starlet s bright eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit part actress  unable to remember her own name  the harring character adopts the name  rita  from a movie poster for the film noir classic  gilda  that adorns aunt ruth s apartment   actually  it turns out aunt ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we re really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings  anyway  betty determines to help rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in rita s purse  the two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to rita s true identity  they also  by the way  become lovers  at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that i cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of lesbian lover affairs  if a lynch movie can ever be designated  mainstream   at the local winkies restaurant  a recurring location fraught with dream like significance behind its grubby realistic facade  rita s attention is caught by a waitress s name tag reading  diane  this leads her to a recollection of someone named  diane selwyn  whose apartment the two women soon visit and  at betty s insistence  break into  i won t reveal what they find within  but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage lynchian creepiness  subsequently  rita wakes in night sweats speaking spanish and hurrying betty to an all night magic show theater called  silencio  where the arts of illusion and lip instrumental  syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the blue  haired lady  as she is noted in the end credits  reigns as the presiding muse  framed by the blue lit  red curtained silencio theatre  the blue haired lady occupies the last shot in the film  perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination   rather like steven s  man with the blue guitar  as filtered through bad  drug surrealism   during the silencio sequence  and as rebekah del rio cameo lip syncs her own powerful spanish rendition of roy orbison s  crying  a shattering epiphany occurs when betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in rita s purse  even if we do not delve too deeply into the freudian sexual symbolism of purses  the moment is a singularly hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings  not the least of these reversals is the discovery that betty is the sought for diane selwyn and the spurned lover of camilla rhodes  i e  rita  camilla in turn is a latin femme fatale movie star to whom diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and  more significantly  to whom she is emotionally subjugated   after these and other discoveries in the last third of the film  the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in  vertigo  while bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much  if not all  of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of diane herself  other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from  twin peaks  including michael j  anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a bob  variant who hangs out behind winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id like associations   however one fits the pieces together  though  the whole of  mulholland drive  is much greater   and more mysterious   than the sum of its parts  lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive  provocative  and pleasurably disturbing mind trip  what s more  the film s cinematography is stunning  the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics  the acting superb  and the directing  editing masterful  this may well have been the unacknowledged best picture of   among major american releases
