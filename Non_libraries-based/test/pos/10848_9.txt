this bbc series is astonishingly good fun  i d only seen a few minutes before i knew i had to own it and watch it again with all my friends  i wouldn t recommend this to anyone prudish  but almost anyone else is going to enjoy it from the cinema snob to the entertainment hungry masses  the lead character is a lesbian  but it s still worth watching if that s not your thing   rachael stirling is incredible in a lead role that stretches her into a dazzling assortment of emotions and situations  some of a bizarre nature  no one who saw this series would ever say she can t act  she makes us laugh  cry  get turned on and slap our foreheads in amazement   you can t really compare this story to anything else  it s not a rehash of style or plot  it s entirely it s own beast part comedy  historical drama  erotica  coming of age tale  musical and more   gotta praise the bbc for making this story  i can t imagine anyone in the  overly prudish and formulaic  u s  ever doing it  so  stop reading about it and go buy it
