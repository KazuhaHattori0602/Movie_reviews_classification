being a retired medical health field  toiler in the vinyard  i never get tired of seeing this film  paddy chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher   visited him   us during several clases back in   his writing ability has stood the test of time   the  hospital  is as fresh as it was in   i can watch it every week   still find something new  so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger   better roles in both tv   film  george scott made only a few comedies  but his timing   patter are as good as jackie gleason   steve msrtin  mental humour rather than physcial slapstick wins in my book every time  and still a family film with only   four letter word during entire film
