although this was a film of only less than forty minutes  it is one of best directed and acted stories i have ever seen  it accomplishes in less than   minutes what most films cannot in more than    it is the story of two brothers  one   and the other   they come from a poor farm family in mississippi  both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of family   it brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed  plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behind   i can fully recommend this film as beyond superb
