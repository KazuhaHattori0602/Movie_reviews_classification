have just seen the last episode  no    though the site says only   episodes were made  and i must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and i would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime cop stories  supposedly all   were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes  this has at times been a gritty  well acted  believable and dare i say  entertaining series  the fact that the powers in denmark decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least  never failed to  get their man  it s a definite   for me
