came across this film recently after so long hearing about it  it is an excellent not pretentious movie for people who loves film noir literature and films  not  camp  but humorous    great cast  from the magnificent carla gugino and emma thompson to german superstar til schweiger  this movie is a feast for the eyes  alan rickman is very funny as the antagonist of gang  would love to see spin off movie with this character and emma thompson solving cases and arguments between them all the time  much like tracy and hepburn  etc   intelligent story  nice twists and scope photography  don t watch unless it is scope because compositions are very rich   sexy sexy sexy and very fun time   best use of just like heaven by the cure ever  must see to believe
