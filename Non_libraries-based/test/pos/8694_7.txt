this movie pops up now and again on the abc in australia at about   am in the morning   it starts off with the scene of a bus crash in london   the films has got flashbacks of each character as the film progresses  plus the lapsed photography of big ben winding back  to symbolise what events occurred thirteen hours ago  up until the bus crash   it took me a while to understand it  but it was enjoyable nonetheless   if sean cunningham and quentin tarrantino got together and made a film  this may be the result   due to the flashbacks and small stories tying in  and deaths   i am unsure of the main characters  as it has been a while since i have seen it  but a rare gem indeed
