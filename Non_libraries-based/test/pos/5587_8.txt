for the record  the   version of  the blue lagoon  is not the original film  as many have stated   this story was filmed in great britain  in   just after the novel was written  as much as i d love to see the   version  i d thoroughly enjoy an opportunity at seeing the true original release of this story on film   granted  the   film with christopher atkins  brooke shields  and the two youngsters was filmed with beautiful cinematography  the acting didn t seem all that great when i first viewed this film  but after having viewed this a few times  it becomes obvious that two children growing up on an island without adult guidance  would indeed have a simplistic way of approaching life  whether it be in their language  appearance  or daily activities   although some have been fortunate enough to view the    blue lagoon  i cannot help but wonder if there is anyone living who can remember the   release of this story to film
