i saw this film on the same night i saw   other shorts  this one was leaps and bounds ahead of the others in terms of quality of acting  directing  filming and originality of story  it comes together with a professionalism often lacking in short films   this is a great short film for the following reasons      amazing performances  the   actresses are both compelling and believable instantly  their chemistry is palpable  the depth of their relationship is conveyed  even though the film is   mins long  the acting and directing are very powerful     beautifully shot  the lighting  framing and general filming are striking  the  mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts  and what a difference it makes  the filming is worthy of this film stock     strong story  often short films try to do too little or too much with the time  or they are trying to tell a predictable story  this is a good balance of telling you an interesting story  without drawing it out too long or leaving you unsatisfied  you wonder what will happen next  while at the same time  feeling you saw something happen   nice score  too  compliments without overpowering   if you can find this at a festival  make an effort to see it
