probably the best horror movie in   years  there s been lame remakes  attempts to make you scared  when all they make you do is walk out of the theater  and movies that just shouldn t have been made  but this one is worth it  the only reason i didn t give it a   is because paris hilton is in it  but her death scene makes up for it  believe me    so here they are  the spoilers of all the death scenes in the movie     my favorite death scene ever   paris hilton s  after finding her boyfriend blake laying on the ground with a knife sticking out of his neck  paige starts to run  well  speed walk is more respectable  she finds this like garage with all these cars in it  then  one of  the killers cuts her ankle from below  this whole time shes holding a huge metal spike so she drops it and runs and hides behind this car  the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window he throws it through the window and it shoots through her forehead  i ve never been so excited or laughed so hard in my life     paige s boyfriend blake gets a knife stabbed into his neck and then the killer walks up to him  while hes on the ground  and steps on it pushing it farther into his throat  then he dies     elisha cuthbert  carly one of the hottest chicks ever  doesn t die phew but she does get her lips super glued together  punched in the face  and gets part of her index finger chopped off  yeah  i felt like heaving    carly s twin brother nick also survives  but not without getting his ass kicked and a stab wound to the leg     nicks best friend dalton gets thrown down a flight of stairs  and then is decapitated  his body is dragged away and we see his eyes blink  then he gets covered in wax     wade  carly s boyfriend  gets his achilles tendon snipped by a massive pair of scissors  and then is attacked by the same scissors  he doesn t die  but hes covered in wax  and on   occasions his skin is accidentally removed  revealing his nasty bloody flesh  yummy    so there it is  definitely worth your money
