hearkening back to those  good old days  of   we can vividly recall when we were treated with a whole season of charles chaplin at the cinema  that s what the promotional guy called it when we saw him on somebody s old talk show   we can t recall just whose it was  either merv griffin or woody woodbury  one or the other  the guest talked about sir charles  career and how his films had been out of circulation ever since the   exclusion of the former  little tramp  from los estados unidos on the grounds of his being an  undesirable alien   no schultz  he s not from another planet    charlie had been deemed to be a  subversive  due to his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems  everything from the anarchist movement from the  s  and before  the technocracy craze to socialism in its various forms were fair game for discussion at chaplin s hollywood parties  which of course meant the inclusion of the soviet style  which we commonly call communism   compounding mr  chaplin s predicament was both confounded by one little detail  he had never become an american citizen   anyhow  enough of this background already    suffice it to say that he had become  persona non gratis  in the united states of america   it was high time to get the old films out of the mothballs and back out to the movie houses  it d sure be a great gesture by us easily forgiving and quickly forgetting americanos   it would be a fine gesture to the great film making artist  besides  the academy of motion pictures arts   sciences was planning to honor chaplin with a special tribute at the   oscar show  this would surely be a tearful yet joyous packaging of pathos a plenty for having america invite charlie back and have him come and receive a special academy lifetime achievement award in front of a world wide television audience numbering in the millions    besides  that would be a natural for promoting the chaplin season at the theatre   remember  the little tramp was as astute as a bu ine  man as he was as a film maker  the program consisted of showings of modern times  city lights  the great dictator  monseur verdoux  a king in new york and finally the chaplin revue  we remember being very excited in the anticipation of the multi date film fest   in our fair city of chicago  it was booked for the carnegie theatre on rush street  the festivities lead off with modern times and all of the others would be shown one at a time  each staying for whatever period was necessary in order to satisfy the public s desire to view each picture  as we recall  the very last on the schedule was the chaplin revue   in retrospect  we look back and wish that they had begun the run with revue  as there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers  much like ourselves  who knew very little about his accomplishments in motion pictures  except for those keystone  essanay and mutual silent shorts that were being shown as regular feature on so  so many kiddy shows all over the country  oh well  once again  no one consulted me   concentrating on today s honored guest film  the chaplin revue  we found that it was actually three separate pictures  carefully bound together by the use of narration by chaplin  himself  some lively themes and incidental music  once again written by chaplin  and some happy talk and serious narration  ditto  by chaplin  he opens up the proceedings by making use of some home movie type of film depicting the construction of the chaplin studio in hollywood  as well as some film taken of some rehearsal time  showing director chaplin demonstrating just what he wants to a group of actors   this segment was well done and well received by the audience  both the building humor and the rehearsal were amplified by making them seem accelerated   the rehearsal naturally  the building by use of speeding up the camera s photographic process  the old trick makes it appear that the buildings were almost building themselves   this amalgam of shorts incorporated three of chaplin s short comedies from his stint with first national pictures  roughly that being   to   the choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject matter and mood   first up was shoulder arms  charles chaplin productions first national pictures    as the title suggests  it is a tale of world war i  released in october of   with about a month to go before the armistice day of november   it was a comedy of comical army gags and a romance between private chaplin and a french girl  miss edna purviance  the levity is fast  physical and in the grand old tradition of ridiculing the enemy  the german army   displaying an excellent example of the old adage about children and dogs bringing folks together  the next film a dog s life  chaplin productions first national    traces the parallel lives of chaplin s tramp and a newly adopted stray  scraps  the movie story involves families  two of them  one homo sapiens  one canine and both supplying us with some big surprises   as the finale  we have the pilgrim  chaplin first national    was a good choice to have as the finale  it was bright  light and tight  it was an excursion into the area of the western spoof  comedies of such type having been done since by every comedian and team  the  pilgrim  in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety  but rather a  dude  or  tenderfoot  who has ventured out west  the tramp is not only that guy  but his character is an escaped convict who is mistakenly thought to be the new clergyman of a western town s church   our rating  that is schultz and me  is    that s four derbies   poodle schnitz
