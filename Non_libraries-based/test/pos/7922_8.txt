 warning  spoilers    although it s hard to spoil this film by telling story details   eisenstein s black and white propaganda film is not for everyone  it s very old and it s  er  clumsy  what makes it great for me is the soundtrack  not the original but the updated soundtrack  better still  the orchestral version prokofiev created  my favorite performance is by fritz reiner and the chicago symphony   the film is actually funny in places  it s reminiscent of the old  midsummer night s dream  some of the outdoor scenes are quite magnificent  some of the actors are also quite magnificent   the actor who played nevsky could have been a superstar today  ditto for the warrior chick  vasilisa   definitely a rocker    this may be the world s best collection  on film  of pithy russian sayings  there are tons of them   they make up the bulk of the spoken lines   the battle scenes actually look much more realistic than most high budget hollywood flix  these guys are as clumsy with their fighting as real peasants would be  the weapons look nasty  so the actors were probably trying to avoid actually wounding one another   the actor playing the german  grand marshall  is trying  really  hard to look scary early in the film  but he looks like he was really a pussycat  after he s captured he looks  so  pathetic   speaks volumes about the intended audience  da   a really humorous touch is that the german army brings an  organ  with it  played by a character in a black robe  watch the russians bring this guy down  while  he s playing   after the battle is over and almost all of the germans are dead comes the best part of the film  and the music  the song sung to the dead soldiers who ve died defending the motherland  this part is so sad it s almost an anti war statement   ten times as many men as ladies have rated this film  wonder why   warning  joseph stalin liked this film  ironic   he killed more russians than anybody   those who come to russia carrying a sword will die by the sword
