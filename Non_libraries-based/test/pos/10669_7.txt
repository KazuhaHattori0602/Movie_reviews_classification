this movie is a gem an undiscovered gerry anderson classic   the origins of both  ufo  and  space   are obvious from this movie  including the cast list which includes the late ed bishop and george sewell who both went onto  ufo   it is unfortunate that anderson  despite his many tv successes  did not get a chance to develop his talent on the big screen  just think what he could have done with the movie version of  thunderbirds   which he quite rightly disowned himself from   i m sure if you give  jttfsots doppleganger  a fair chance you ll appreciate it s good qualities
