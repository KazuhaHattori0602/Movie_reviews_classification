   just the whole concept of the movie is great  i believe it s got something to do with a race of bioengineered beings  keeping tabs on us and our planet  but there is one person who keeps out of being assimilated into conformity  and the way that he does it to keep himself from being tracked and located  is what keeps the movie entertaining  i don t remember exactly how it ended  but i remember  it finished with a great climax  and a good twist
