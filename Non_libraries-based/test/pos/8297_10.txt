once a year in america  saturday morning would give way to new cartoons  usually sometime in america  just about the time school started   i guess this was to make not having school on saturdays that more bearable   one friday night before the premiere of the new saturday morning cartoons  a movie came on    at the earth s core  i had not a clue who cushing nor mcclure were  clearly they were not from the same country  so i couldn t grasp why they were traveling together   i do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire breathing monster s mouth   what connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory   how do you end a movie like this  the music again  and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them   whatever reason  i remember watching this movie more that friday night than i do any new cartoon that came on the following morning   that was definitely the late seventies   it would be during jurassic park mania  cicra   i believe  before i would see this movie again   yes  people in costumes  there was the fire breather again   still loved the ending with the two cops   finally  it would be nearly another decade before i would send off for the movie on dvd   now i would just watch the beginning and intro   oh  i do love much of the movie  of all these sci fi jules verne  hg wells  erb movies  this one stands as my fave   what i note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon  then turns back  then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill   perhaps for me  this movie stands as the best of the saturday morning shows  which is why i enjoy it so much
