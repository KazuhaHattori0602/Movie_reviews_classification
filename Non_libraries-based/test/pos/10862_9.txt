this wonderful   part bbc production is one of the sweetest love stories that i have seen in a while  the actresses display a very high level of talent  especially rachael stirling as nan astley  she is funny  seductive and cute  the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one s sexual preference    the characters are well defined and very believable  i guess this is a by product of a good adaptation from a well written novel   a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring  but necessary  scenes in the beginning   my vote
