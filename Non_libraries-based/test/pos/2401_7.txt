i watched the movie with tears and smiles alternatively  anger surged in me to see the ruin of hanoi after the  day bombard  and by living in the country right now with my parents  who s been living in saigon for   years  i understand that we re much better off now  and would have been better if the american didn t bring war here  watching the movie  i learned more of the different kinds of wars that the america planned in vietnam  and what disasters they caused   the series seems to do well with the interviews with the real people  but i don t like it that some people only give generic opinions  like the analyst near the end of the series  i forgot his name   there should also be more documentary images  like the life in the army camp of the south vietnam  and those of the north  if possible  there s also a sudden change from the year of   to    i m not sure if the in between was censored  because i watched this series on tv
