talk radio is of course  probably not the most well known of stone s films  but don t let that put you off  this film is ripe for discovery  i defy anyone not to be entranced by it  along with the best performance of  s cinema by eric bogosian  for me  along with jfk this remains stone s finest moment  stone doesn t seem to comment much on it these days and didn t do a director s commentary on dvd like all his other films  stone has nothing to be ashamed of  most directors would kill to get a shot   a film like this   the claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of champlain are still very crucial arguments for today  the  legalise all drugs  speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with him in my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don t like hearing things they don t agree with the speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling  even disturbing  a chill ran down my spine when a crazed man calls champlain saying he has to rape again because the city drives him crazy is totally shocking the tension is sometimes unbearable with a scene when heavy metaller kent becomes unhinged  of course champlain does himself no favours by ridiculing him  champlain or should i say bogosian  is fearless in film and performance  totally mesmerising  a shame th  bogosians other big role was the villain in under siege  dear god one scene th  didn t ring true was when barry s boss dan alec baldwin  gets him to calm down  barry doesn t seem to be the kind of person who shuts up and does as he s told  it seemed a bit contrived and clich d the scenes outside the studio are criticised for being too formulaic  it s true because stone is trying to make the film more cinematic and allow the viewer to see champlains beginnings but it doesn t entirely work    it is a brilliantly cinematic film with extreme close ups  deep focus  extremely fast cuts a fantastic   set which is used for the final breathtaking monologue  must see cinema  it makes it rare because it was ignored  the time but is now receiving attention again which it so richly deserves  a classic th  should be studied by generations of film students      out of   for inventive use of  bad to the bone  before t  brilliant supporting cast including john c mcginley dr cox from scrubs  as the sleazy stu  leslie hope as champlains girlfriend  john pankow and alec baldwin as the suits and micheal wincott who plays three roles  a very underrated actor  the tension between the listeners and champlain which is very heart racing   times and of course kudos to the stars bogosian and stone for such a fantastic piece of cinema  enjoy
