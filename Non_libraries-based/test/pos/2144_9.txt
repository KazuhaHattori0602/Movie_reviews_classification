until today  i thought there only three people  including me  who considered heaven s gate  to be a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western   since the   after  little big man   jeremiah johnson   the outlaw josey wales   and the long riders     i was stunned and pleased to see that   of those voting at imdb rate this movie a   as do i  a recent book  the worst movies of all time  includes heaven s gate  through it s production and release it was vilified  as no movie since cleopatra  almost twenty years before  at one time it was considered the most expensive over budget movie of all time  surpassing even cleopatra  it was blamed for the downfall of its studio  united artists  until everyone finally saw all the studios were falling  michael cimino  fresh from his glory with the deer hunter was hated and despised for his success and movie making excess  but clearly  that was petty jealousy at its worst    cimino ended up fashioning one of the great expositions of the american experience  this film is not to be missed but any serious student of american filmmaking
