i wasn t sure about getting this movie on dvd because i really do have something against people making black and white films in the  st century  but i ended up buying it anyway  i still don t understand why it had to be black and white  but that s the only negativity i can see about the film  and it sure is a perfect example to see the definitive rise of brazilian cinema  not everyone can understand a film like this  but it s quite rewarding to those who do  unlike o homem que copiava  the surrealism fits this movie pretty well  and the acting is at least as good as that one  or other successful brazilian films such as bicho de sete cabe as  cidade de deus  brava gente brasileira  etc    my only hope is that this gem doesn t get insulted and raped by a crappy hollywood remake  it s amazing to see how those guys spend zillions of dollars and still can t make a movie that s   as good as this possibly low budget flick    bravo to the entire crew
