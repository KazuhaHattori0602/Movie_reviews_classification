before this was shown on mtv or vh  it was at my local theatre playing just before the main movie  i remember this short movie more than the film i saw that day  it was the first time i had ever a music movie like this  but i will tell you that seeing on the big screen from a  mm print in a darken theatre gives it a much better impact than seeing a cropped pan and scan version on vh  at halloween
