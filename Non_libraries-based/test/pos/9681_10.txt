family guy has been hilarious for so long but i feel like it lost it s sharp and random humor at the start of season   although i enjoyed blue harvest  it felt like the remaining episodes were  wrapping up    episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill family guy s reputation of american social satire   i have seen all the episodes from season   and i was utterly surprised and happy that family guy has found their true colors again  season   delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in america which is exactly what we need right now   more fun   i feel that the simpsons has lost its spark all together  this show  however  has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be  great job
