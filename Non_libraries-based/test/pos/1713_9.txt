i enjoyed some of the older doctor who many years ago  so when the new one came out  i just had to check it out  i was so pleased   with the characters  the story lines  the updated look  i became hooked  from season     for the old fans  through to season     it just keeps on getting better  it ties in nicely with the old shows too  although you don t have to know the old shows to enjoy this newer version   even though there has been a change of cast  i highly recommend doctor who   with chris eccleston and with david tennant   i like that they ve given the characters so much depth  the doctor seems more vulnerable in this series  maybe because he is the last timelord  the range of emotions which chris and david show are truly remarkable  and i felt their pain  anger  and sense of adventure right along with them    billie piper  rose  brings a very human element to each episode  although she is much braver than i would be  with her talent  billie will go far in the industry
