yeah  i know my title sucks  i couldn t think of any other title  x] ice is a brilliant first season episode  very interesting idea and good acting as well  the whole worm looking thing was really creepy in my opinion  i ve never been a fan of insects  so all the insect episodes are creepy to me  x] anyway  lets go on to the good and bad things about this episode   the good  the parasite thing  awesome   scully finally trusting mulder  a     it was a good idea to put another parasite in the ear  though if someone told me they had to put that thing in my ear  i think the whole cabin would be dead   the bad  how did the dog stay alive for so long   how didn t huffman get those black spots  or maybe she did  but no one saw it   conclusion  very good episode  especially for season
