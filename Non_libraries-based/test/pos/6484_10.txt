my first review at imdb  after a few years of using this site constantly   anyways  saw this on the tube the other night  loved it  it s in the mindset of a dangerous minds or a substitute  but much better  was sure for a moment that rex was speedy levitch  in waking life  but after checking  it doesn t seem so   i can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry  but i also think these people are close minded  admittedly the ending wasn t quite what i was hoping for  but overall it was so unique and well acted  i can t complain  i wouldn t call this cheesy  as one reviewer did  it pulled off the scene better than most films of the  s did  and they refrained from playing any really dateable  s music   can t remember everything that made me smile when i saw this  but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity  and whether i share rex s beliefs or not  i love original attempts to describe the meaning of life  and his mutant theory is  to my knowledge  original  he rambled a lot as well  but they showed how confused he was at times  and why he might have some psychological issues  and then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire  a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them   also i was very impressed with john savage as the teacher  usually actors fail at that role  he pulled it off brilliantly   if you enjoyed waking life  i say watch this movie if you get a chance      pk
