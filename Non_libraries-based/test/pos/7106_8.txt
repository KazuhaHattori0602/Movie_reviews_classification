dracula  john carradine  visits dr  edelman  onslow stevens  who believes everything can be cured by science  he wants edelamn to cure his vampirism edelman agrees  then lawrence talbot  lon chaney jr  pops up looking for a cure for his turning into a werewolf  thr frankenstein monster is discovered too but doesn t really do anything   very ambitious plot for a universal horror film from the  s  trying to cure the monsters by science is actually an interesting idea  also this movie has beautiful sets  love the castle to doctor lives in  tons of atmosphere  is very well directed  great use of shadows  and has pretty good special effects   the acting is all good except for carradine he tries but i could never accept him as dracula  also lionel atwill pops in playing  as always  the chief of police  this is pretty much forgotten and derided as a stupid film but i think it s very good  it s also to last time the universal monsters were done seriously the next film was in   in  abbott   costello meet frankenstein  it s a great film but the accent is more on comedy   the only real flaw here is there s a lot of plot for   minutes and some gaps in logic  why does dracula try to bite lovely miliza  martha o driscoll  when he s being cured  and why  and how  does the doctor get frankenstin into his castle  still these are small complaints  recommended
