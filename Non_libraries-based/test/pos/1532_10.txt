i really love this movie  it has a very real feel to it  i believe it was never popular because of the subject matter  however  because of the subject matter  it makes the movie all that much more important   this is an  a  movie and i recommend it highly  if you liked   book or movie  i think you will like this one as well   this is harsh  to say the least  including mental and physical acts of torture  some pretty vile  not for the week at heart or stomach  no gore  but his movie is so great at projecting the mental anticipation it doesn t need blood and guts   if you are not a realist or a pestimistic person i don t think you will enjoy it  it leaves you with an uneasy feeling about humans  what they re capable of  and the very real possibility that our government s does not necessarily have our personal best interest in it s heart
