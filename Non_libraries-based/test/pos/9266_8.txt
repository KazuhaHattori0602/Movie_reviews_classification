this film is so different to anything you would have seen before  it s an honest and chilling account of an entire family s battle with a terminal illness     the closer she gets  is shot in a very unique style  craig oulette films in a very different way  using different angles and viewpoints  in what i find is a very eye catching manner  perhaps due to his experience with photographic works    his style gives such a clear picture of not only what the patient herself is facing  but what loved ones close to her also have to deal with    a very sad  but extremely interesting and unique film  one i would definitely suggest watching
