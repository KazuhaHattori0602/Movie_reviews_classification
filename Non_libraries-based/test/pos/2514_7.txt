a bland title disguises this solidly carpentered example of old fashioned hollywood entertainment  this film proves a largely successful hodgepodge of several disparate elements  a period piece  a romantic drama  a crime movie and a political thriller  interestingly  though made by fox  its protagonists   robert taylor and barbara stanwyck   were both usually associated with other studios  their on screen chemistry here is palpable and eventually led to marriage in a couple of years  time  while a bit too young  taylor is a dashing hero  a marine personally appointed by president mckinley to uncover the culprits behind an organized clean up of numerous banks  unsurprisingly  no sooner has he tracked them down  led by smooth brian donlevy and thuggish victor mclaglen  that he falls for a chanteuse  naturally  stanwyck  who has thrown her lot with the gang   although  truth be told  singing is far from being the actress  forte  similarly  apart from having to prove his worth to make it into their fold  he has to vie with mclaglen for stanwyck s attentions  by the way  the practical joker persona of the former reminded me a lot of charley chase in sons of the desert   which  incidentally  was likewise directed by william a  seiter  later on  taylor is in two minds about involving stanwyck in the impending bait and tries to offer his resignation to the president while eloping with the girl   but the jealous rival disrupts his plans  the robbery gone awry  we find donlevy dead and the other two in jail  taylor s hopes for mckinley s intervention   having meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and obviously prominent  inside man    are seemingly dashed when the president winds up assassinated himself  a great plot twist  though the resulting eleventh hour suspense feels contrived  to get back to the film s jumble of styles  even if the vaudeville sequences are a matter of taste  the romantic triangle slows things up and it skimps somewhat on the thriller aspect  this emerges a handsome production indeed   with the actors already mentioned ably supported by the likes of john carradine  who unaccountably disappears after just one scene  douglas fowley  sig rumann and  as two american presidents  sidney blackmer  the bubbly theodore roosevelt  and frank conroy  mckinley
