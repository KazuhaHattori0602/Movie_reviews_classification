sweeping and still impressive early talkie western of pioneering days  other contemporary films in the same vein include the covered wagon   the iron horse   and cimarron     none of which i ve watched  though i do have the latter on vhs  it was simultaneously filmed in the  standard  fullscreen ratio and in an experimental widescreen process called  grandeur  but only the former has been released on the bare bones fox dvd  one can only surmise how it would look in a wider ratio  but the careful framing   not to mention the splendid cinematography   is evident enough even in the  standard  version   young john wayne is surprisingly commanding in the lead  a role which  however  didn t lead to the expected stardom   as he d languish in  b  westerns for the best part of the next decade  before john ford came to his rescue with stagecoach [ ]  anyway  he and marguerite churchill  from dracula s daughter [ ]  make a nice couple   despite her somewhat tedious character  supporting characters include a variety of stock types  veteran westerner  comic relief sidekick  with a penchant for making noises with his mouth  burly and uncouth villain  played by tyrone power sr  his two slimy cohorts  a mexican and a southerner  the latter also filling in as wayne s rival for churchill s hand  etc  also among the members of the wagon party is a timid swede  full of optimism for the promised land  but who s continually put down by his irascible mother in law  and later wayne regular ward bond   the episodic narrative resolves itself into a number of alternately cornball  lyrical and action packed vignettes   as we see the prospective settlers combating the elements  the indians and themselves  the film  however  has a completely authentic feel to it which smooths over its essentially dated and static quality  also  the editing is somewhat choppy  particularly during the second half    little wonder  since the dvd edition of the film is only   minutes long against the complete  minute  grandeur  version
