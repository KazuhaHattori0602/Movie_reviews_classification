successful films on metaphysical subjects are rare  but fata morgana is a good case  you can chalk up the large subject to the ambitions of youth  but herzog does an amazingly good job  the movie s point is to show human beings  and even the world  from a non human point of view   the movie is in three parts  creation  paradise  and the golden age  the imagery of each is in counterpoint to the voice over  although the text of `the creation   from the popol vuh  a mayan myth  refers to the primordial wasteland  the scene goes no further in illustrating the myth  it dwells on the waste  and on various specimens of destruction  fire  smoke  wrecked vehicles  the images from `paradise  are anything but that  and `the golden age  is darkly comic   the highest culture is the strange roadside musical act   the popol vuh suggests that mankind is the central object of creation  but the movie does everything it can to undo this notion  its mythological framework has no referent in human historical time  there are no human characters to speak of  when a boy stands with a dog in an extended shot  the initial suggestion is of the boy s point of view  by the end it is much more the dog s  likewise the lizard is a stronger character than the human who introduces it  and the turtle s partner barely looks human with his big flippers   animal stories and nature documentaries always anthropomorphize  but fata morgana has none of that  certainly the dunes look like a female body  but the simile cuts both ways  presumably only humans can distinguish easily between their creation and nature  and here airplanes and factories are presented alongside mountains  lakes  and waterfalls  people and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape   in   herzog put a new twist on the idea when he remade nosferatu from the vampire s point of view
