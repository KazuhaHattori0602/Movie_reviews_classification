i work at a nuclear power plant  so i am getting a kick out of these replies   seriously  i do  go to   and you can see where i work   i could not think of a safer industry to work in  we are required by procedures to report events as minor as paper cuts  any issue identified as being a potential concern with respect to nuclear  radiological  or industrial safety is immediately reported in the corrective action process   bottom line is that nuclear plants in the us operate with safety in the front of their mind
