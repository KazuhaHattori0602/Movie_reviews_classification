first of all   i m not one to go all sappy over movies  i saw friends in the  s when it was first released  i was about   years old at the time  even now  at age   i still can remember some of the scenes  the movie is sweet and sad and may actually be too tame for teenagers today but i loved it  the story is about innocence  the purity of young love and the determination of   young people to make a better life for themselves then they had at home  at the time it was pretty risky to have a movie about a couple of young runaways who successfully setup house and have a baby on their own  i m not surprised the movie and elton john s soundtrack are almost unknown today  the music is beautiful  it was unforgettable
