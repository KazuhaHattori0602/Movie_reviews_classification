airplane apart  i don t think i ve ever laughed at a film so much in all my life   i love football like mad  but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic  this wasn t   i watched it once  it was over   years ago   it was brilliant  everyone i know loved it  i remember the gay physio  the sloping pitch at about a   degree angle and  shoes   a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes  brilliant  that s what goes on in park football   a definite   if anyone from the tv industry is reading this  considering all the crap you repeat on english tele  please have the sense to show this again  and the muppets while you re at it  also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or itv  i think it was itv  so it s worth asking them if they plan to show it again  they should do
