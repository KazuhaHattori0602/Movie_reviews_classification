following a mugging incident at new york s grand central station  an innocent bystander  kevin spacey   the usual suspects  is arrested by police who believe him to be under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs  we can understand why they think this  considering how the man politely informed them that he wears his dark glasses because  the light on your planet is really bright  and so prot  as he identifies himself  pronounced as rhyming with  goat  is shipped off to the psychiatric institute of manhattan  where a weary workaholic doctor  mark powell  jeff bridges   the big lebowski  attempts to understand this man s so called delusion   prot s manner is courteous and cooperative  when asked why he believes he has been institutionalised  he matter of factly replies that it is because  you think i m crazy  within minutes  after satisfying his insatiable newfound hunger for earth fruit  the completely forthright prot has revealed that he is an extraterrestrial from the planet k pax  which resides   light years away  circling the binary star system agape and satori located in the lyra constellation  he also details how his infinitely more advanced species has already mastered faster than light travel  through harnessing the energy of light  an accomplishment that is allegedly eons away for the human race   powell is understandably very skeptical of these outrageous claims  though he is nevertheless fascinated by them  and commits himself to understanding how prot came to believe such a thing  meanwhile  prot uses his time to observe his fellow patients in the psychiatric ward  eventually offering everybody around him something to live for  and hope of a cure  on july   prot later reveals  he will depart again for k pax  and he can only take one human with him  of what will actually happen on that date  nobody is certain   originally slated to play dr  powell   with will smith as prot   kevin spacey stepped into the main role when smith had to withdraw from the film  you can tell that he had a lot of fun with his character  the completely matter of fact delivery of his sometimes ridiculous dialogue  your produce alone has been worth the trip  often eliciting genuine laughter  there is undeniable intelligence behind many of prot s words  but logic maintains that he must be delusional  mustn t he   the audience is led back and forth between the possibilities   for the first segment of the film  we almost accept the possibility that prot is an extraterrestrial  this is a sci fi movie  isn t it  before being totally convinced when prot inexplicably displays an impossible knowledge of the astronomy of a newly discovered planet system  a final investigation by dr  powell offers us a neatly packaged terrestrial explanation for prot s delusions  but this is just as quickly whisked away  and we are left scratching our heads again  the film  quite rightly  keeps its ending open  leaving the audience to contemplate what they ve just watched and to discuss it with those around them  nevertheless  whether you believe prot to be an alien or not  two irresistible certainties linger in your mind  the universe is  indeed  a fascinating place  and perhaps there are higher forces that we humans are yet to discover
