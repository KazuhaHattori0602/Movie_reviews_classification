as a word of explanation  disney s  the kid  has absolutely nothing in common with the charlie chaplin   classic of the same name  what we do have is a pleasant enough  though unbelievable  feel good family comedy as only the folks at disney can provide    bruce willis  in a change of pace  plays a self centered stuffed shirt of an  image consultant  he degrades  not only his clients  but those close to him as well  you know that he is going to have to change before the final credits    into his life comes a chapter from his past in the form of willis  character as a nerdy   year old played with cutesy pie conviction by spencer breslin  disney always finds these kids somewhere  this forces willis to come to grips with his past and well you know the rest    appearing as willis  love interest is emily mortimer and lily tomlin as his executive assistant  both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the inter action between the willis and breslin characters     the kid  though not the greatest of disney movies is one nonetheless that you can sit down and watch with your family and come away from with a warm feeling
