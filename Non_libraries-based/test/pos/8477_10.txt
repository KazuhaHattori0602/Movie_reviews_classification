brilliant biographic film


   well this certainly is one of my very fav  biographic movie  this movie came as a total surprise to me  i had been avoiding this movie for a very very long time  now that was because i am not a fan of jamie foxx  i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now   well he deserved every bit of that oscar  his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time  he is truly sensational   well the narration  or the flow of the story is brilliant for a biographical movie  i am a drama fan so i wasn t bored at all   i was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that i did not see any flaws in the movie  i think there isn t any flaw in the movie  maybe some events errors but hey who cares   the performance by the woman who plays ray s mother was also really good  and well kerry washington 
 she has so much potential  if given the right role she might just be the next oscar winner   well the story of them movie was so emotional so touching  i cried
 i cried very badly

  i don t give a damn if the things were mad  up or not cuz this movie mad me cry
 and that s a lot for me   all in all a superb film

  one of the very best of this century
