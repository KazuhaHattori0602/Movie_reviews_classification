i still remember watching satya for the first time  i was completely blown away  here was a movie that was very different so from the other gangster films that i had seen  so realistic  so mumbaiyya and so believable  despite  company   which was a very good effort  and  vaastav   more focused on the journey of the protagonist  which came close  no underworld movie could ever live up to satya   when i watched ab tak   for the first time  i said to myself  indian cops have their own  satya  now  the quote by nietzsche in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film  what strikes you about the  encounter  at the start of the film is the relaxed manner in which it is carried out  there is a cold and scary feel to it cos you realize that it is part of their routine   ab tak   is not the story of an honest cop or a corrupt cop but of a cop who is ready to do what it takes to get rid of the criminals when all lawful means are exhausted  with simple shots and camera angles  director shimit amin manages to capture the essence of the characters and gives a realistic and rough feel to the movie  editing seems non existent and hence effective  the music is also impressive and haunting and stays with you long after you ve left the movie hall   but for me  what really takes the cake are the dialogues and the superlative acting from each and every character  sandeep srivastava has done a brilliant job as the dialogue writer  if i start listing my favourite dialogues  i m afraid i ll end up re writing the entire script of the movie   the movie boasts of some stellar performances  yashpal sharma is detestable as sub inspector imtiaz siddiqui and so is jeeva as joint commissioner suchak  revathi  hrishita bhatt  mohan agashe and kunal vijaykar have small roles which they play to perfection  nakul vaid as the rookie jatin shukla was a revelation  the scene where he has to hesitantly shoot the wounded gangster   oh my god  he learns under the tutelage of sadhu aghashe and firmly believes in him   prasad purandhare as zameer zafar is impressive  his conversations with sadhu are real jewels of dialogue writing  never before in indian cinema has any film brought out such a beautiful relation between a cop and a gangster   not that i have not been a fan of nana patekar before this film but this film pushed me from a fan to a devotee  nana as inspector sadhu agashe gives the performance of a lifetime and one of the best i ve ever seen in hindi cinema  from the way he talks to his expressions  from the way he taps his cigarette to the way sips his tea   it s almost as if nana can do no wrong  he is at his best in each and every scene especially when he s teaching jatin about how the police force functions  his cool and composed manner of doing things is scary at times  his dialogue delivery and body language had me convinced that he is one of the finest actors in the country  it s a shame that he did not win any popular awards for this one   last but in no way the least  shimit amin does a brilliant job of bringing all this talent together and exploiting them to the fullest to come up with a modern masterpiece of indian cinema  in an industry that is sickeningly accustomed to lifting stories from here and there  amin takes an original script and brings it to life with a beautiful treatment  i just hope that he continues the great work and doesn t give in to bollywood isation  if he can do that  i m sure he ll be a force to reckon with in the coming years
