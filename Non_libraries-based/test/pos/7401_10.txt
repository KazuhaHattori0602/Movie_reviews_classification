seriously  i don t really get why people here are bashing it  i mean   the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd  the good news is  the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of army of darkness    especially in the second half of the film  when the little killer snowballs attack  i laughed my ass off  for example  the put one of the little creeps into a blender  a la gremlins   and mix it  after that  it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice  that was fun   bottom line   incredible movie  rent it
