clayton moore made his last official appearance on screen as the masked man in director lesley selander s epic adventure  the lone ranger and the lost city of gold  co starring jay silverheels as his faithful indian scout tonto  selander was an old hand at helming westerns during his   years in films and television with over a   westerns to his directorial credit  this fast paced horse opera embraced a revisionist perspective in its depiction of native americans that had been gradually gaining acceptance since   in hollywood oaters after director delmar daves blazed the trail with the james stewart western  broken arrow  racial intolerance figures as the primary theme in the robert schaefer and eric freiwald screenplay  having written   episodes of  the lone ranger  television series  schaefer and freiwald each were thoroughly familiar with the formula  but they raised the stakes for this theatrical outing  our vigilante heroes ride to the rescue of indians who are being murdered by hooded white hombres for no apparent reason  the mystery about the identities of these assassins and the reason behind their homicidal behavior is revealed fairly early so that you don t have to guess what is happening   although the violence in this selander saga appears tame by contemporary standards  the fact that the lone ranger shoots a bad guy to kill in one scene rather than wound and that a dastardly dame slays a double crossing accomplice by hurling a tomahawk that sinks into his back between his shoulder blades was pretty audacious  the television series never went to this length  and when the lone ranger wielded his six gun  he shot the gun out of the villain s fist rather than blow him away  the other discrepancy here is the indians lynch one of the raiders and torture him for information  but they are never brought up on charges from abducting this henchman  douglas kennedy didn t have the villainous statue of lyle bettger who menaced the masked man in director stuart heisler s  the lone ranger  but he acquits himself well enough as a cowardly outlaw who kills one of his own henchmen without a qualm when the miscreant threatens to divulge his name and the identities of his cronies to a band of vengeful indians    the lone ranger and the lost city of gold  opens with a recap of the masked protagonist s origins as an ambushed texas ranger and his transformation into the lone ranger with tonto serving as his sidekick  this opening two minute refresher is an excellent way to get a series oriented character off to a start so that everybody  including non lone ranger fans  is on equal footing  the primary plot about a gang of ruthless white wearing hoods and called not surprisingly the hooded raiders begins with them killing indians and stealing medallions worn around their necks  the lone ranger and tonto arrive too late to intervene  but they find a baby hidden nearby  taking the baby and the dead indian  they ride to a nearby spanish mission supervised by padre vincente esteban  ralph moody of  the outsider  and turn the infant and body over to him  initially  the padre has to assure an indian maiden  paviva  lisa montell of  gaby  that the masked man means them no harm and is their friend  padre sends tonto off to town to fetch the doctor  dr  james rolfe  dean fredericks of  gun fever  and tonto promptly runs into trouble in the form of the paunchy town lawman  sheriff oscar matthison  charles watts of  giant  who abhors indians  tonto tries to see the doctor who is treating prisoners in the sheriff s jail and matthison s men start to rough him up when rolfe intervenes and rides back to the mission   eventually  the lone ranger and tonto are able to capture one of the hooded raiders  but an indian redbird  maurice jara of  drum beat  and his fellow braves abduct the henchmen and take him back to their village  they stake him out and shoot arrows at him to loosen his tongue  chief villain ross brady  douglas kennedy of  hell s crossroads  and his cohort william  lane bradford of  devil s canyon  ride out to the village and brady uses his winchester to kill his captured henchman  little does brady know that his henchman talked  the lone ranger and tonto arrive not long afterward and reprimand redbird for his perfidy  redbird tells them what the man said before he died and the lone ranger decides to adopt a disguise so that he can learn more  he masquerades as a gentleman bounty hunter with a mustache and faux southern accent   despite its concise  minute running time   the lone ranger and the lost city of gold  lacks neither excitement nor surprises  selander keeps the action moving ahead at a full gallop  the dialogue is largely expository rather than memorable as schaefer and freiwald push the plot ahead more often than spring surprises  but there is one major surprise that ties in with the good indian theme  there is also a scene where the lone ranger pushes his own credo about justice available for everybody under the law at a time when supreme court chief justice earl warren had embarked on the high court s landmark decisions that recognized and mitigated against the conditions surrounding racial segregation  civil rights  separation of church and state  and police arrest procedure in the united states  one thing that differentiates  the lone ranger and the lost city of gold  from its predecessor is its epic scale with flashbacks to the age of the spanish conquistadors with a slight bit of science fiction involved in the form of a destructive meteor  generally  lone ranger stories confined themselves to the  th century without dragging in european history  no  the lone ranger wasn t the first movie to deal with spanish conquistadors  robert d  webb s  the seven cities of gold    concerned the spanish searching the southwest for the eponymous places  but selander s western beat gordon douglas   gold of the seven saints    to the screen
