this is lucio fulci at his best  if only all the films he made after were like this   this extraordinary film is as intriguing as dario argento s  the bird with crystal plumage    if you re an argento fan but you don t like lucio fulci films  like   the beyond   manhattan baby   the house by the cemetery  etc  this one has nothing to do with the others  this is what the italians call  giallo  that would be something like a  who done it  movie in a nutshell   you won t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film   but apart from that  there s the plot  some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys  a journalist  tomas milian  a sexy young woman  barbara bouchet  a priest  marc porel  his mother  irene papas  and a witch  florinda bolkan  are the main characters in this tangled  bloody story   talking about the actors  i want to say that tomas milian is superb  like always  and florinda bolkan is terrific as the village witch   do you want to know who is the killer    i cannot tell you  but i can tell you that you must see this film     out of   of course
