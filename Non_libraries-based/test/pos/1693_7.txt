aside from the fact that the women in the film are stunningly beautiful and all the camp prisoners are too fat  this film rings true on the chaos of the post war   beautiful photography  and a powerful national expression of the polish national character   it s very slow at points  but its entire pacing is so different from american and western european films that it s quite refreshing   both lead actors do a very good job  on the dvd version  you can see interviews with the principal actors and crew  and the lead actress stanislawa celinska has gained about   lbs and lost all of her beauty  but in   she was a stunner
