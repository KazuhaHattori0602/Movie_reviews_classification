this is by far my favorite action movie  but what makes it work is not the elaborate renny harlin explosions and shoot em ups  it s the shane black script and its deft delivery by geena davis and samuel l  jackson   the chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel  thank god it was never made  too much danger of marring the original    the long kiss  checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again  never a dull moment    this has to be jackson s funniest role ever  and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career  no quirky tarantino hit man  super cool shaft  or borderline psycho soldier  in tlkg  jackson is the everyman we identify with  the poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman s odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past   though the story claims that davis s character  samantha caine is suffering from amnesia  the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder   samantha caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac charly baltimore   she is a separate  fully developed personality  the traumas suffered by samantha in the first half hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of charly to emerge again   the materials of her past life excavated by jackson s detective mitch henessey facilitate charly s resurfacing  good timing  too  considering the target samantha makes of herself   but charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality  one gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality  charly  developed after her father died and she was recruited by the  chapter   in the eight years charly was buried in the psyche  though  her samantha identity developed into the dominant personality   she s even funnier that charly  this was probably due to becoming a mother  because it s the reunion with her daughter that breaks charly s struggle to suppress samantha  leading to their apparent integration by movie s end   it s impossible to choose a  best quote  from this film    now you re a sharpshooter    i saved your ass  it was great    continue dying  out    i sock  em in the jaw and yell  pop goes the weasel   and a couple of dozen more  many too raunchy to quote here   geena davis looks great  and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she s turning forty   listen to charley s history  do the math   fantastic soundtrack  too  santana  muddy waters  elvis  labelle  marvin gaye    i give  the long kiss goodnight  a   only because i don t believe in a perfect   seen it a dozen times  and it still stays fresh  nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to  it s a wonderful life
