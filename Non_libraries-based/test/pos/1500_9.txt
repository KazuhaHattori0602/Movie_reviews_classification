the three shorts included on this compilation issued in   are timeless chaplin classics  nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either  chaplin s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done  the problem with this compilation is a minor one  yet annoying  the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the   frame p s  speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at   frames p s  this results is jerky motion that doesn t look very attractive  and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time  it s just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored  the films look dirty as they did in   and are still stretch printed  there are separate restored versions of these classics available  even on dvd  and it would not be a problem to restore the image  but alas this has not been done   a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article  but i say again a minor quibble  it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating  the shorts are still worth
