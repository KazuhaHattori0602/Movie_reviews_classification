i can t add much to what has been said already  except i m going to have to because of the   lines minimum policy   i ve actually got this on a vhs to dvd copy  but the quality is quite poor and i desperately need for it to be officially released   i can just imagine what extras i would like to see  tim healy s character swearing his way through one of those  football bloopers  type programmes would be great  you can imagine it now  can t you  but of course  it looks like most people will have to carry on dreaming about a dvd release   surely to god there must be someone in the dvd releases department at itv who also knows something about british culture  is web savvy and has enough about them to look at imdb now and again  oh  well
