for every fan of coming of age tales  this   hour adaptation of the  sarah waters novel is pure fun  cinematic nods to baz luhrman s  kinetic style  as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces  ever present on the bbc  where you re likely to have seen almost  every prominent member of this cast  it s rather bawdy and over  the top in spots  but that s just what the novel called for  the cast  is appealing and  in the cases of anna chancellor and hugh  bonneville  perfect  in the case of rachel sterling  as our heroine  nan  you simply must overlook the fact that she s far too pretty to  ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it  it s a fantasy  after all    some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in  character  particularly that of jodhi may s character  florence  but  the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and  provide an overall high quality entertainment value
