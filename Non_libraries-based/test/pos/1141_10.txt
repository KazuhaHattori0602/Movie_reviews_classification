i went to this film having no idea what to expect  i actually took a date to it in the theaters when it first came out  we both thoroughly enjoyed it and it helped to have someone to discuss it with after seeing it   i only recommend seeing this film if you appreciate non mainstream movies  it s not as disjointed as liquid sky or as fanciful as forbidden zone  the original plot is very easy to follow  there s a lot of subtle humor   here s a quick summary of the plot if you are completely lost  a big brother type government keeps tabs on everyone in society  suddenly a new person appears and there s no data on him  he appears insane  he may or may not be the second coming of christ  the over cautious government goes into a frenzy to find him and discover his true motives  the ruler is also obsessed with immortality   some scenes are frantic while others are completely low key  we follow the lead character as he encounters all different kinds of people in society   i didn t need my consciousness altered to enjoy the film  but i know that some of my friends felt that helped   split was also filmed around santa cruz and san francisco
