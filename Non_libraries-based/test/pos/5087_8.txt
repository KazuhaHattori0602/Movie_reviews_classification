though  short lived  the amazing spider man  was one of the best made for tv versions of a famed comic book hero  only  wonder woman   lynda carter   the best of the genre and  the incredible hulk   bill bixby  lou ferrigno  were better    the amazing spider man  outclasses the    batman  because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure   spider man  outclasses all three television interpretations of  superman   lois and clark   smallville  and of course the george reeves  superman  which brings up the rear    the amazing spider man  was an action drama  during the late  s  the pre cgi era  when stunts had to be performed by stunt men  not in the database of a computer   spider man  had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics  his name was fred waugh  who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences  nicholas hammond  better known as one of julie andrew s children on the all time movie classic  the sound of music  was spider man during the dialogue scenes  hammond s spider man also had his own secret identity as peter parker  similar to christopher reeve  superman  clark kent  adam west batman bruce wayne  and of course lynda carter as wonder woman  diana prince   it s unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes  because when the first episode hit the airwaves in november of   the entire country was watching it on cbs that wednesday night  in all fairness  cbs should release this pilot episode as well as  the deadly dust  the  captive tower  etc  on dvd shortly   spider man  was short lived  but did have a cult following  and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring toby mcguire   cbs might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons   a  there might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren t born when the series originally aired in the  s   b  one of the early  spider man  episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the world trade center  which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air  in   and of course the devastating attack against this country on   in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost   however i don t think that it would be in bad taste to release this  spider man  episode even if the show was adventure  derived from a comic book  and camp in nature  the live action  amazing spider man  doesn t have a large following but it has a cult following  if and when cbs releases it out on dvd this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which spiderman saved the towers in   but how in september of   real life proved to be different from the movies  i like to follow the news  but i also like science fiction fantasy  therefore i am eagerly awaiting the release of  the amazing spider man on dvd
