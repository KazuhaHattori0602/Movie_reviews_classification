if it had been made   years later it would have been banned  the number one must see recommendation of the day  the best rouben mamoulian film i have seen this far  have but have not yet seen j h   there s no wonder why this film got less than   votes  a bigger greyzone that could not care less about what s proper would not be seen again until the  s  as morally ambiguous and dark as  s grit but with a certain charm as well  of course this had to lay low in the later  s and sadly it does not appear to have been re discovered   seriously  this got it all  great actors  gary cooper  sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy kibbee  and a mighty good director  this far i haven t been rm s biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league  one of the best  s films i have ever seen  this is something i never thought even existed
