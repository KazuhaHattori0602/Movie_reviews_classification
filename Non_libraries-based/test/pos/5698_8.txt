  au website   a decade under the influence  documents the precise moment at which that change took place   before the seventies  the armed forces were depicted in american films as an invincible fighting force comprised of decent human beings who transmogrified into conquering heroes on the battlefield  after the seventies they are generally portrayed as a dispirited rabble misled by a bunch of bureaucrat clowns in the pentagon before the seventies  the fbi agent and the honest cop tended to be depicted as your friend and protector  after the seventies  the fbi agents were all incompetent and the best a cop could aspire to was to ignore their foolishness and his superior s corruption and uphold justice in his own idiosyncratic manner   before the seventies  the archetypical american  little guy  the  average joe  the jimmy stewart type would face down the problems encountered and thereby gain some insight into underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the  american way  after the seventies  kevin costner usurps that role  but now he is the voice of one crying out in the wilderness for evil to be exposed  or accepting his lot and making out the best he can   and now those  old time religion  mindsets have been stripped of any honesty and righteousness and portrayed  with a certain amount of justification  as sanctimonious bigotry and self serving hypocrisy    a decade under the influence  tells it like it was   a decade under the influence  tells it like it is now  it depicts the redemption of the american film industry from the hands of the artistically  morally and intellectually bankrupt studio moguls  it shows the storming of the hollywood bastille by the independent film makers who promised to get a disillusioned and tired audience back into the cinemas  the fact that their failures were numerous  and at times disastrous  merely underlines the greatness of their achievement  an achievement reflected in the adventurous and questioning attitudes of the big box office stars such as clooney  daman  affleck etc and the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent
