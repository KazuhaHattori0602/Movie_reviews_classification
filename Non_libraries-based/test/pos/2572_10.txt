i suppose this is what is called southern gothic   it stars samuel l  jackson  christina ricci  and also justin timberlake is featured in a role  timberlake does good work  much to my surprise  i didn t expect it of him   when you re lost and you can t find your way home that s the black snake moan   the people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways  psychologically and emotionally damaged  betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain   samuel l  jackson plays a blues singer musician whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother  along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her   christina ricci s character is a woman who was sexually abused when young this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac  allowing men to treat her badly   the story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives  it is a love story  but not a sexual love story  between them the older black man and the young white woman   it is different from most films hollywood grinds out   i highly recommend it     stars
