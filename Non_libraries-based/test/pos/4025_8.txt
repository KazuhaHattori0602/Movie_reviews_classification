we saw la spettatrice at the syracuse international film   video festival   liked it   this film delved into the fear we all have  fear of rejection  fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies   the three lead actors  barbora bobulova as valeria  brigitte catillon as flavia  andrea renzi as massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent  it was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real   i believe barbora bobulova is a stand out  i hope we see much more of her in the coming years   this film doesn t take the easy way out  thumbs up to the italian team who put this film together  highly recommended
