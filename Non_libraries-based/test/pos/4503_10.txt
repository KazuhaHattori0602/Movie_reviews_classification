this is absolutely one of our favourites of    the tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly told   beautifully shot  and scripted   from childhood to the adulthood it never falters   a brilliant insight into a lost culture  and a very good way to understand farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right  it is both compassionate and thrilling  uplifting and filled with immense sorrow  joyful and depressing   with excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its best   highest recommendation  a real slice of life that uplifts and informs
