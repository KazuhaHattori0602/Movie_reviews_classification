in   i wrote the following statements on an imdb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives was a forgotten movie      to me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule  i think in many ways  the best years of our lives  is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the us in the mid s after wwii  i believe  coming home  and  the deer hunter  both released in   were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in  the best years of our lives   what really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when i was in college around   and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the movie   this movie still packs a wallop and i m very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time     i m very happy to see the movie ranked near the top   movies on imdb and afi  also  though it was in competition with what eventually became a christmas classic  it s a wonderful life  arguably  the best years of our lives  oscar wins  including best picture  were very well deserved    i ve just seen the film again in   and after almost   years  the best years of our lives is still a powerful  beautifully acted and well crafted motion picture
