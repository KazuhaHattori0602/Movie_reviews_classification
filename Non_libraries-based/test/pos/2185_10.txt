george hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great  i ve heard the len cariou version but it was too tame  george was great in that character   very expressive   angela lansbury was perfect for the part  she gave a great performance  she gave the mrs  lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story   i love the dark humor when angela lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of george hearn in his songs of rage  vengeance and distress   i ve watched this play   times since   when i saw it on pbs  i bought it on video  after copying it in   on my own when it came out in   and i definitely bought a copy of the dvd when it came out in
