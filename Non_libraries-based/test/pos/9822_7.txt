i ve read approximately   reviews of this film  but haven t taken any of them  to heart  harrison ford is being criticized for everything from his haircut to his earring and i really don t see what any of these things have to do with the film  as i recall  he had bad hair plus bad reviews in blade runner but it s still a favorite among us videophiles  it is slower than the majority of his previous films but not worthy of the trashings it has received   i would gladly pay   just to watch a bald harrison ford mow his lawn
