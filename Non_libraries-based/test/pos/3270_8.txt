jimmy  heath ledger  is given a simple job by pando  bryan brown  a underworld kingpin to deliver money to a particular address  but when no one answers the door jimmy decides to take a dip at the beach to pass some time  but he notices that his clothes on the sand have been messed up and the   grand is gone  jimmy rings pando to tell him the problem  but he doesn t want to hear it  pando and his boys try their best to locate jimmy  meaning no more jimmy if they get their hands on him  so now jimmy goes into hiding to organise a bank robbery to get pando s money back  also throughout this mess he meets the innocently sweet alex  rose byrne  and together they re in for one hell of a ride through sydney s king cross    two hands  is simply an engrossing pick me up film that s brisk  exhilarating and incredibly fresh  what you got here is pretty much an urban gangster film with a seedy backdrop and in your face violence
 what  how s that fresh you ask  well  because it takes us into the underworld where the australian culture shines with criminals wearing thongs  flip flops  and footy shorts  done up cars and a can of beer in the hand
 and don t forgot the australian sense of humour  dry and sarcastic  you can say it owes a lot to the likes of  pulp fiction   goodfellas   a fave of mine  and  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  for its inspiration  but for me it still stands on its own  the film has real mixture of light hearted moments  but also a mean streak to it with some unexpected shocks and black humour that can actually be disturbing  you just don t know what s coming and it has a nice touch of snappy irony  especially the ending  and great timing with its humour  one scene involving a bank robbery will have you in stitches  i guarantee you  the plot s outline is really a coming to age story  or about the road not taken  with a punching love tale added and then the gangster element to finish it off  most of the sub plots were cleverly constructed and interlocked  well maybe it could ve gone without the supernatural element involving jimmy s dead brother  but in the overall context the diverse plot seems to all click together  intense  natural and crisp dialogue filled the outrageously colourful script  with quick jabs of aussie slang twang   i m fair dinkum    what truly made the film was that of bryan brown s performance of pando  he just gave his character such a deviously charismatic nasty persona that when he wasn t on screen his presence was still felt  he gave his character two sides   one being a prick  but the other side is such a good bloke  a young rose byrne glows with her nervously sweet quirky character alex  she looked radially gorgeous and added a bubbly personality  then you got heath ledger who fit s the buck as the naive jimmy  great supporting cast involved with the likes of susie porter  tom long  david field  steve vidler and steve le marquand  such raw performances are achieved and from that you get riveting  fun and believable characters  pumping rock soundtrack bursting at the seams with the likes of powderfinger and alex lloyd provide a cool vibe  also being shot on location in sydney s king cross really helped it stick out by holding a life of its own and showing the australian way of life  gliding camera tricks captured the city s backdrop superbly  especially the piercing nightlife  this was a film that when it ended i was totally satisfied with what i got  overall  a slickly paced crime thriller that achieves what it intended to do  a fun  clever and crazy roller coaster ride of thrills and excitement   i say  it s a successful aussie take on  lock  stock and two smoking barrels  by director writer gregor jordan in his debut film  if you come across it  don t hesitate to it give it a go
