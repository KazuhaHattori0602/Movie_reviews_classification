as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clich d movies that hollywood makes  there seems to be no creativity in hollywood  companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in   this movie is a welcome change  it could be classified as romantic comedy for it s genre but don t let that turn you off this movie  this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces   if you are reading this  you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that  the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are  interstate   and  art of travel  which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage   this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same   dean
