honestly  i don t really understand why there has been so much controversy about this show  it embraces the elements of the original  while expanding on them  the storytelling has been updated and  while some of the episodes seem to be a bit  fast  that is a good thing   christopher eccleston is perfect in the role  easily as good as tom baker   rose is one of the best companions  on par with sarah jane smith or leela   i like the concept that the timelords have been destroyed   no more politicking with the doctor acting as president emeritus  and it adds something to the character to be the only one left   the sfx are outstanding   especially in comparison to the original   take it from me  and i was a huge dr who geek   i actually took notes while watching the show all the way from dr number   to dr number   i tossed the horrible movie out of cannon  personally  this is the best sci fi show on tv right now  possibly ever  watch it and buy the dvd
