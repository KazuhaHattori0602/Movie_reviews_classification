richard condie is a canadian marvel  and one that should be shared with the world  be it for gut busting early work such as  getting started  and the oscar nominated  snit  through  the apprentice  and the digitally made  la salla  condie is a treasured local hero  but no singular piece of work puts a stamp on his career quite like  the big snit  and did i mention it was nominated for an academy award  darn tootin    the big snit  although clearly a dated message bearer from the  s  the short revolves around cold war esquire nuclear annihilation  but don t worry   it s hilarious as hell  carries with it a larger meaning  as is most of condie s work in an understated sort of way  while the planet scurries for cover from armageddon  a couple bickers over each others  annoying habits  in true condie fashion  he hacksaws the furniture while she shakes her eyes   literally  and don t forget to watch it again and again   cuz there s always something to look at  condie loads this fella up with countless visual gags and memorable catch phrases   i strongly encourage this incredible piece of animation be tracked down  in canada it s usually spotted in a national film board video that includes other stellar shorts  including fellow winnipegger cordell barker s equally funny  the cat came back  americans will just have to dig a little deeper  but keep at it   the reward is worth the toil
