i caught this movie at the glenwood cinemas at the weekend as part of the kansas international film festival  which  as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema    i have been keen on australian film for a number of years  so was pleased to learn that this film was included  and i was certainly not disappointed    superbly shot  firmly directed  it s an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness  as it were  it reminded me a tad of lynch s wild at heart  it has that strange madness in it  but i was glued to the movie for other reasons   namely that it presents a portrait of australia which is well  very believable   i have vacationed to the land down under a number of times  once in the  s and again about   years ago with my wife    i don t wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations  but the director frayne appears to have a grasp on much that i find so odd and eccentric about australia  a country that is responsible for the extremities of  say  nick cave on one hand  and steve irwin  the  crocodile hunter  on the other   one incy wincy whinge     i would have preferred even more of the  unknown  australia  much more in fact  but i also realise that there s only   and a half hours to do it all in   sigh   overall though  this movie is very  very accomplished
