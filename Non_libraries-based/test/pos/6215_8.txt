in the spirit of the great space coaster  but a few years earlier   hot fudge was one of the psychedelic kid s shows that i grew up on  seymour was a big  fuzzy  green puppet  with a crescent smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head  i recall him wearing a variety of elton john type shades   he  played  piano  and had a jesus looking dude in a white tux  sitting next to him  they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it   don t remember much else except the opening theme  seymour and the hippie   no one else i know remembers it at all  i grew up in jersey  so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said  it wasn t just local  seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the squirrel from the magic garden  another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one  people always talk about lsd s effects of music and movies of the  s  but it seems kid s show writers got a dose as well
