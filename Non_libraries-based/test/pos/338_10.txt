the director of kannathil muthamittal directed the first indian film i had seen  dil se  which led me down the path of buying well over   hindi dvds in the  course of four months  i can say i understood the total attraction  i was  somehow confused as to why the film would stop for  music videos  it was an excellent movie  i didn t know what to make of the dancing and the female  vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears  but somehow i found ar rahmen s score hypnotic  i bought the soundtrack the following day and then lagan  kuch kuch hota hai and k g the following week and with the exception of  ichi the  killer  a few other korean films   i can t be bothered to watch much else  kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of hong kong  horror  and action science fiction films for the past   years   but i should get back to kannathil muthamittal  it is one of the mani ratman s latest efforts and i laughed  cried  got totally mad  terrified and most of all i didn t feel manipulated  the acting was superb  the photography was beautiful  i think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting  the music fit the movie perfectly and after the  credits rolled  i wanted to watch again  so i did   it would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop  this is what great film is all about  i stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over   my wife is watching now  and i can t wait for her reaction  i can t expect it will be anything less than mine
