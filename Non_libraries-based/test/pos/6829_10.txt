the second episode of the new  lost  gives you just what its fans were lacking   a fair amount of riveting action  from the very first scene  you keep seeing brand new features you weren t expecting to encounter  it s the best proof that the series  ingoing its  th season  is still alive and kicking hard   although the producers don t amaze us with some more flash forwards this time  the return to flashbacks is more than satisfying  as it brings some shocking facts  the flashbacks introduce a few fresh characters  and the familiar ones turn out to be connected in a surprising way   the fresh characters dominate the whole episode and i can t say it does any harm  their scenario parts and their actors both do extremely well  providing us with a bracing feel   right after the episode  you ll realize that the show really needed people just like that  and here they are    confirmed dead  is full of gripping action and greatly written dialogues  i m sure i ll quote the best scenes of the episode for the long time   they re just that good that they remain on the spectator s mind  the episode is entertaining  smart  and perky  you like  lost  you have to watch it  my vote is ten
