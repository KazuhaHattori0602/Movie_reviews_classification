this film had a distinct woody allen feel about it  so if you re not a fan of dry humor  dark humor  or back handed humor  you probably could find something else to do  if you are  however  this is quirky  with some nice twists and a flowing  natural dialog   the story itself is quite engaging  not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes  but close  i mean that in the best way possible  the intrigues are plenty  the twists are enough to fully engage the senses  and the characters are downright lovable   i had a great time with this movie   it rates an   from   the fiend
