meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the  s  this movie plays more like something mr  schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway  a mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in florida  and along the freeway of life  the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor  the problem is that what didn t end up on the cutting room floor probably should have  now available on dvd  it s kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost   million to produce had it been made in   it rolls along and isn t too difficult to sit through  and  strangely enough  in   we re all still pretty much just  hopping in our cars and going faster and faster  heading nowhere
