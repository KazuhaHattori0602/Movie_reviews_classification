i would suggest that only the valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that peck ever did  daring   surprising and one of his few best westerns  no  no  of course  not a western really  but a military chronicle  which sometimes is better  it s quite low budget  but  oh  very original and striking  it s one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets  movies that no one yet told you they exist  you say that sounds intriguing  or interesting and it surpasses your expectations   all in all  the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the westerns and it somehow reminded me  obliquely  of ulzana  it s also straight no nonsense suspense   peck looked dashing as a young and tough  somewhat gloomy and stoic officer  and there are many unexpected touches like the blonde babe kissing and flirting with the one she s decided not to marry  perhaps a feeling of hers for justice and retribution 
   even genre wise  only 
 is so much more than a military tale it is as well an action drama  a suspense movie  a commando  action thriller the weirdest combo imaginable  a bunch of soldiers in a special mission to counteract and stop a possible native s attack 
 the insane decision not to take all the available troops to the place where those natives could be stopped but only a handful of people 
 and this plot never takes a crap route as most would and did 
  the interest for humans  for people and their reasons and actions never falters   a due word about peck himself  he performs with brio  and though i usually find his famous movies to be rather insipid and boring  in such small outings i find intact all peck s somber and even chilling glamor  he was an unusual star   i gladly recommend this extraordinary movie
