 the deer hunter s  success with critics and publics alike led united artists to give cimino carte blanche on  heaven s gate  an epic western about the   johnson county wars
   the elliptical story  about the persecution of lowly european born farmers by wyoming s cattle barons  was a muddled mixture of class conflict  sumptuous pageant and underwritten  stereotypical characters
 however  cimino s fetish for authenticity and his sweeping sense of scale ensured that the film running at nearly four hours   was rarely tedious
   its undeserved status as a cause c l bre  with critics divided as to whether it was a masterpiece or a fiasco  derived from its inflated budget
 blamed for the studio s financial problems  cimino became a scapegoat for hollywood s general decline  and the film  edited into an incomprehensible short version after its initial release  was a commercial disaster
