its such a shame that an important film like this is virtually unknown   i don t think alan bates has done a better film than this   its never shown on television  the only time i can recall it being shown on british tv was in the summer of   i have it on tape but sadly the quality isn t great due to a dodgy aerial at the time   i remember wanting to see this film for some time before it appeared on tv  it was shown on channel   in the early hours of the morning  thereby ensuring that it still remained unseen except for a very small audience   i was living in bristol at the time and it was ironic that  when i finally saw the film  i realised that i had walked past the very house where it was filmed several times before  the film treads a fine line  a married couple attempting to make light of their tragic predicament of coping with their severely mentally handicapped daughter by laughing about it and even involving the child in their jokes   the direction and the acting are so superb that the film is always compassionate and moving and is never in danger of lapsing into bad taste   a couple of years ago i saw a clip of the filmed theatre production with eddie izzard in the role of bri and victoria hamilton playing sheila   it showed izzard improvising and larking about and hamilton jokingly telling the audience to ignore him when he s being like this   i maybe taking this out of context as i only saw a brief clip but having read the play and seen the film this is clearly such a delicate subject that such an approach is both insensitive and disrespectful   izzard was praised for his performance but i felt uncomfortable with what i saw   it is perhaps surprising that such a successful play failed to find an audience when it was finally filmed   this is one of the best british films of the  s and hopefully it will be released on dvd one day
