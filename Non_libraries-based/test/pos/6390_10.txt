it gives the ordinary guy girl the chance to be on television singing as their favourite stars   for the majority of the time  they sound like the singer they are meant to be portraying   another twist to it   a team of make up people and costumers dress the contestant up like that singer  they might not look like them but the likelihood of getting someone that sounds like a person looking exactly the same as them are very slim   it s a load of fun for your saturday night   and the contestants aren t raging wannabes like they are on another tv singing show  the fact that there are no prizes involved and it is for fun means that it will attract a different type of person   the only gripe i have is with the kids version   it looks like they have done the round of stage schools  what happened to the normal kids
