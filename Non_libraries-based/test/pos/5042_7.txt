the title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character  fanda  he s an older man living in the late autumn of his life  yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who s just entered a spring meadow  the frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him  his wife supports this idea when she observes   fanda laughs at funerals and death  in other words  death is not something fanda takes too seriously  he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable  life  however  and the pursuit of living life to its fullest  is the philosophy that governs fanda s existence  he is not one to merely exist  but must live for each day and each passing moment  for tomorrow is not guaranteed    the film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow  let alone death  too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life  fanda s wife for example  she s so worried about preparing for death  not in some religiously connotative way  but in a far too practical  even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile  laugh and just have a good time  her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie auto pilot mode  fanda  to the contrary  is perhaps too blithe and absent minded for his own good  he needs a person like his wife  emilie  to help balance him    it s as though fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child  like a kid trapped in an older man s body  he is introduced as the adventurous type  he pretends to be people he s not in order to get gain  squanders money  factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh  deep down  though  he is a kind hearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife  the two off set each other quite nicely  though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death  meaning  their divorce  it is during this courtroom scene that fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love  his wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws  yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior  in this moment of her forgiving him  fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy    ironically  though  after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls   a living corpse  the life blood within him drains away as he becomes more like her a zombie going through day to day motions  he doesn t seem to live anymore  but exist  for example  he gives up his zany pranks  doesn t squander money  quits smoking on account of his wife  not his health  and overall  just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him  succinctly put  he changes on account of wanting to make her happy  thus  the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish  realizing that her husband is not who he used to be  there is a part of emilie that misses the old fanda  she misses her husband s aloofness and the fights they used to have  because it was in those moments that they were truly living  not just simply existing    i believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here  that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient  but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times  the possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment  life is often taken for granted  but when threatened with death be it literal or figurative people awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest  it s as though they are scared that they ll never live again  so they better make the most of it while they have it  fanda and emilie had been married   years with fights along the way  but it wasn t till they were both threatened with the possibility of death like separation that they began to show their true colors  as the old maxim goes   love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation  they both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way  more importantly  the intimate relationships they make with their significant others
