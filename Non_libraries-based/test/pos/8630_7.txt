i wanted to see this movie because i am a very huge abbott and costello fan  and when i saw it  i liked it   this movie is funny  not hysterical  but funny  i mean i laughed at a lot of the funny parts and i just plain enjoyed it   though it is not of the best of the perfect straight man and the perfect buffoon  you should see this if you really love abbott and costello   out of all of the abbott and costello movies that i have seen  i can t say i ve seen one that i hated  this is decent  funny  and entertaining  abbott and costello at least made some pretty decent movies in their later years   all in all  i liked this movie  it is not one of their best ones  but i liked it
