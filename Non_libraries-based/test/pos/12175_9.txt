i enjoyed erkan   stefan   a cool and fast story which didn t get bogged down in detail  those two guys are great to see and are able to come up with new ideas all the time  the high quality of picture and cut support the movie a lot   erkan   stefan show that the german film industry is capable of transferring successful hollywood concepts with local `satire  into our cinemas
