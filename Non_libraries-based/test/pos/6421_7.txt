i first heard of this one while searching the  net for reviews of another italian giallo horror effort  the contemporaneous the perfume of the lady in black   whose r  se dvd from raro video  by the way  i recently acquired    where it s referenced as being in a similar vein but also just as good  having watched footsteps for myself now  i can see where that reviewer was coming from   in that both films deal with the psychological meltdown of their female protagonist  stylistically  however  this one owes far more to art house cinema than anything else   in particular  the work of alain resnais and michelangelo antonioni  and  specifically  last year in marienbad [ ] and the passenger [ ] respectively  accordingly  some have accused it of being  deadly boring    an epithet often attached to such  pretentious   read  cerebral  fare    anyway  the film involves the quest of a woman  florinda bolkan  to determine her movements in the preceding three days   of which she seems to have no recollection  following a series of cryptic clues  she travels to the  mythical  land of garma  nearby locations  then  bear the equally fictitious names of muda and rheember    where she encounters several people  including lila kedrova as an aristocratic regular of the resort  who ostensibly recall the heroine staying there during her  blackout  most prominent  though  are a young man  peter mcenery  and a little girl  nicoletta elmi  from mario bava s baron blood [ ]    the former always seems to happen on the scene at propitious moments  while the latter apparently confuses bolkan with another woman  sporting long red hair and a mean streak   while essentially a mood piece  this is nonetheless a gripping puzzle  inevitably  vague events transpire at a deliberate pace   and where much of the film s power derives from the remarkable central performance  which can be seen as an extension of bolkan s role in the fine lucio fulci giallo a lizard in a woman s skin [ ]  however  there s no denying the contribution of cinematographer vittorio storaro  who provides any number of sweeping camera moves and an effective color scheme   adopting orange red blue filters to create atmosphere and coming up with a saturated look for the disorientating  bizarre finale  and nicola piovani s fitting melancholy score  the composer is best known nowadays for his oscar winning work on roberto benigni s holocaust themed tragi comedy life is beautiful [ ]   with this in mind  it s worth discussing how footsteps was presented in the version i watched  well  being apparently hard to get in its original form  i can t be sure whether it s uncut here or not  except to say that the film ran for   minutes while the imdb   lists it at   this edition is culled from a fairly battered english language vhs  the dubbing is surprisingly good  given the international cast  with burnt in swedish subtitles to boot  besides  the divx copy froze for a few seconds at a crucial point in the story around the  minute mark  still  we do get a welcome bonus i e  a  minute  highlights from the soundtrack  in mp  format   i realize i haven t yet mentioned the moon mission subplot  to which klaus kinski s presence is restricted  incidentally  around this same time  he had a similarly brief but pivotal role in another good arty thriller with sci fi leanings  and also set in a distinctive location    namely  lifespan   as i lay watching the film  i couldn t fathom what possible connection this had with the central plot
except that bolkan mentioned a recurring dream about a movie she had once seen  though not through to the end  called  footsteps on the moon   a somewhat misleading alternate title for the film itself    amusingly  she at first recalls the picture as being called blood on the moon  which  of course  is a classic   western noir with robert mitchum and directed by robert wise  that said  i took this  diversion  in stride as merely one more outlandish touch to the film  given also bolkan s former employment as a translator at a conference discussing earth s future    and certainly didn t expect the astronauts to turn up on garma s beach at the very end to pursue the female lead  where the sand then turns ominously into the moon s surface
    the film s plot will probably make more sense on a second viewing   though  to be honest  this is best approached as a visual aural experience and one shouldn t really expect it to deliver a narrative that s in any way clear cut and easily rationalized  for the record  the only other bazzoni effort i d managed to catch prior to this one was the middling straight giallo the fifth cord   starring franco nero  which i had recorded off late night italian tv  some time ago  i did get hold of his spaghetti western rendition of  carmen  titled man  pride and vengeance     also with nero and kinski   as a divx  after i d already missed a matin e broadcast of it 
but the conversion had somehow proved faulty and  consequently  the disc wouldn t play properly
