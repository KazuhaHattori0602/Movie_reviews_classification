with  batman returns  tim burton succumbed to an important priority in american cinema  giving a sequel to a blockbuster  three years after the most successful movie of the year   batman    here comes the hero of gotham city again for the pleasure of many spectators  like its predecessor   batman returns  enjoyed an enormous commercial success  tim burton made batman come back once again because it is to believe that the victory of the latter on his enemy the joker did little to improve the image of gotham city  indeed  violence and corruption still exist and here  the second word is epitomized by max shreck  christopher walken  and the penguin  danny de vito  these two crooks who are eager to take control of gotham city are going to make life difficult for batman  his task will be more difficult with the apparition of catwoman    tim burton still delivered much work on the scenery and it seems that he tried to correct the faults of the first movie  it means that the director gave way to fight sequences which are better mastered than in the first batman  but he didn t neglect the psychology of his main characters for all that  if in the movie of   burton had focused on bruce wayne batman s psychology  here  it s the penguin that obviously interested him  the director attempted to make of him  very well acted by de vito an ambiguous character  on one hand  he s full of bad intentions  previously quoted  but on the other hand  he s searching for his past and would like to be considered as a real man    batman returns  also appears as crazier than its predecessor  especially with the cast  i think of mich le pfeiffer who offers a daring and powerful performance as catwoman  besides  at the time when i m writing this review  it makes me remember that a new version of catwoman is currently at the cinema  but given the bad reviews   out of   on imdb  it is sure that her performer halle berry must pale into insignificance beside pfeiffer   ultimately  this film is one of the best sequels of   and it enables to develop tim burton s peculiar style  we also still find his taste for the strange and the gothic  concerning batman s other adaptations for the screen  you can skip them   batman forever    and  batman and robin    are no good  i heard that christopher nolan was shooting the beginning of the batman story and it was to be released next year  will it match tim burton s works
