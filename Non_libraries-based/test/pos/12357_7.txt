i thought it would be more fantastic a tale  but the subject is rather down to earth compared to the story about the death carriage i was expecting  in fact there is much more of a social drama  as usual in the  european authors  movies   actors are interesting  not overacting as in the average silent movie  images are not so good as to be stuck in your mind as in bergman s smultronst llet   this is true the comparison between the two movies is the main point here  smultronst llet begins with a vision of a death carriage wherein sj str m s character can see his own body  there are clocks without hands  he is compelled to look back on what he has done wrong  there is a vision of his happy family in the country  in k rkarlen sj str m s wife doesn t cheat on him before his eyes but she wants to flee with the little children because it would never get any better with him  eventually  edit s confession is some kind of a live judgement   well i would just add that sj str m destroying the door with an axe because his wife locked it and plans to go away with the children reminded me of the shining  which was much more of a fantasy tale with death hanging around
