one of my favorite lines in shakespeare   i e   we re not finished with you by a long shot  so not only does shylock not get his pound of flesh  or the   or the   or the    each of the   parts were a ducat  ducats  in a matter of minutes he is ruined by having to forfeit all his possessions  and his daughter has long abandoned him already   vengeance is a dish best served cold  but shylock s attempt at revenge totally backfires    i suspect this play was and is popular because it caters to the wish we have for justice  but the hard reality is the world is engulfed in injustice and most of it stands  a few big names get tossed in jail  sme gang punks lose their turf to the  good guys  but in reality most of the time it s the other way around   but not in this play  the long howls of racism and antisemitism forgets that it could well have been any other social outcast group that gets the comeuppance  it s just that the money lenders of the time were jews and therefore the needs of the story line puts shylock the jew into the role of villain   merchant of venice is my  rd favorite work by shakespeare    and   being hamlet and macbeth  this production gives excellent treatment of the moral of the story  the scenes with the suitors alone is worth watching  also the awkwardness of the new husbands squirming and minimizing the fact they let the rings so easily slip away that they had sworn to keep forever  in real life  this trick is the thing that spouses coyly use to remind their better half that promises must mean something and not be made frivolously  there is far deeper significance to this play than just the comedy dramatic aspect  it is about loyalty  commitment  and love   well worth watching over and over
