i enjoyed this programme immensely  it is exceptionally well written  with finely judged performances and clever visuals   it is also very frank and honest  refreshing compared to the sanitised representation of drug use in films and television   unmissable   one of the finest television shows of recent years  and triumph on all scales for channel
