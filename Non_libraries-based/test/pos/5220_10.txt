father hood  i can understand why a lot of people hate this tale of a father kidnapping his two children and carrying them across america  but i ve seen much worse  and when i saw this years ago i didn t think it was particularly awful  patrick swayze is the worried father who takes his kids on the run with him for personal reasons  and halle berry is the cop chasing them down   overall a decent way to spend a couple hours of your life  you could certainly do worse ever hear of the film  pod people       out of    rated pg  for some traumatic scenes  adult content matter  violence and language
