the  th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as  mediocre  or poor in quality  but it is a great movie   too bad that  the aristocats  doesn t get the deserved credit  i personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics   despite being extremely underrated  it is one of the funniest disney classics  it is full of hilarious  some of them  hysterical  moments   edgar  the greedy butler  is the villain of the movie but he is a perfect comic relief  he s one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny   every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you ll ever see  especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge  with the dogs chasing him  that is hysterical   but the classic humor doesn t just come from edgar or the hound dogs  other characters have their moments as well   about the quality subject  it isn t perfect  but remains on a high level  even after walt disney s death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt s spirit and  the aristocats  is one of those examples  they don t make them like this nowadays   as usual  legendary disney actors voice the characters  in this case  we have phil harris  sterling holloway  paul winchell  eva gabor and pat buttram   the characters are cool in general  thomas o malley  duchess and her   kittens  the mouse roquefort  the alley cats  the english geese  the hound dogs and the horse  the human characters are included as well  the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide bonfamille  the comic madame s old lawyer georges hautecourt and edgar himself   about the soundtrack  it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas o malley s theme  but i can t remember its name   everybody wants to be a cat  and  the aristocats   sung by maurice chevalier  for example   this movie takes place in paris  france  in the year of   above all  this is a joyful  nice and very pleasant movie  a timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten  but very worthy   this should definitely be on top
