i am a maharashtrian  a teenager living in the  st century  and its obvious that i m not much into even bollywood  let alone marathi movies  yet  when i watched shwaas  it left me with a unique feeling  one which only an extremely effective movie is capable of generating   it is a fact that  like most indian movies  the movie has its true and complete effect only if viewed in its original language  a lot of the emotion and meaning of the movie is embedded in its marathi dialogues  which  however hard one tries  can not be effectively translated into english   shwaas explores  in intricate detail  the relationship between a grandparent and a child  and it does complete justice to this strong bond  dialogues like  mazha parsha pan laakhat ek aahe my parsha is also one in a million  enhance the emotion  anyone who has closely observed the grandparent   child relationship will be able to relate to the situation portrayed in the movie   overall  it definitely worth watching  its a movie that has left a profound effect on me  i will surely recommend it to anyone
