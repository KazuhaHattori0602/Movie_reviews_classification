finally i discovered what i thought i remembered as a four year old  after seeing the   color version on vhs  i kept saying i remembered seeing it in black and white   times before  now the imdb has helped me to know the truth  that it was broadcast twice   productions  in black and white in   successful years        these are the ones i remember best as a four year old  i didn t realize the   broadcast was not the same as the   in   i was   and the color production just didn t do it for me  the black and white version was wonderful with just as much awe and wonder impact as the high tech films of today  even without any computer effects  you had to have been there  please comment if you had a similar reaction to the b w version
