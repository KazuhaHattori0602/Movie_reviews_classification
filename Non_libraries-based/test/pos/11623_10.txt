recently finally available in dvd   severo p rez  film and the earth did not swallow him   is based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in chicano literature  tom s rivera s  y no se lo trag  la tierra   and the earth did not devour him   is still generally acknowledged by many critics and serious readers as the classic chicano novel  originally written in the spanish characteristic of south texas and also translated into english  rivera s novel continues as an indispensable presence within the chicano literary landscape    perez  film  originally made as a highly rated american playhouse pbs production has taken some time to be released in dvd  one can only wonder about this matter because its high quality is not an issue  the film  and now dvd  however  remains  so far as i know  the only cinematic adaptation of any chicano novel and clearly is a tribute to earth s incredible staying power  this cinematic version also strikes an exceptionally deep rooted nerve that is  i maintain  both specifically ethnic  yet also generally universal  doubts about earth perhaps might have arisen because it is too  ethnic  too alien from a basic american mainstream  too much a  foreign  art indie  too limited in economic resources  yet  perez in his version of art  in my opinion connects very effectively  artistically  and creates a sharply etched portrayal of a chicano migrant collectivity that focuses on daily family life  as far as a production done with relatively limited economic resources  its lovely cinematographic work and haunting music go much beyond its available funding  simply viewing the film makes manifest this film s  or dvd  artistic value   briefly  
 and the earth did not swallow him portrays in a neo naturalistic way the plight  the suffering  and the despair of chicano migrant laborers as they follow the crops northward from south texas to minnesota in   the local priests bless the beat up  overstuffed vehicles of these chicano laborers who can no longer find work in the area and must follow the agricultural trail of the migrant worker northward  this chicano collectivity  like the depression era joads in steinbeck s the grapes of wrath  forms an epic tide  driven by economic need  a survival instinct  and anguished despair  and ultimately a barely flickering faith  a tribute to these people of the earth  a collective hero  the dvd is centered on a focal family  and most especially emblematic is a young protagonist within the family  a boy  perhaps twelve or so  this work then  also  functions as a bildungsroman  ultimately  the viewer s sense of identification is generated through the experiences  subjectivity  and the struggles of the protagonist  poverty  alienation  child labor  illness  sunstroke and a pregnancy death  discrimination  school absenteeism  the boy s escapism from the bullies of discrimination is spent lying down in a lovely  peaceful cemetery  are laid bare as matter of fact yet  also symbolically  worse still  the problematic conflict between the youngster and his mother goes beyond socio economics and political conflict  into deeper realms of psychology and metaphysics  in a desperate but artistically rendered struggle  the youth battles his mother  an archetypical mexican american traditionalist  a representative of god s will  content with prayer  resignation  consolation  and acceptance  the rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that would permit such evil and suffering to be visited upon them  how can god be so cruel  he asks  since his little sister is certainly purely innocent  as to come down with serious illness in the fields  at this point  the boy must overcome obstacles even more daunting than poverty and discrimination  the issues now include death  doubt  and despair  and lack of meaning  and he has few resources available to him strength of character  his own will power  his intelligence  and a powerful survival instinct  in this desperate  but artistically rendered struggle  the unnamed youngster  the central figure  feels the necessity of his enduring  of his achieving a heightened sense of meaning  and  the viewer hopes  a renewed and strengthened life force that can serve as an inspiration to chicanos and others   this stark battle makes use of a plot device just touched on by the original work to tie the episodic work together  missing immigrant laborers from mexico who leave no trace upon their death  although this dvd deals not with mexican but mexican american migrant laborers a highly existential work  anguish and despair  a quest  a focus on a project  and redemption all under the auspices of free will in spite of the deterministic socio economic and religious circumstances   perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker  his many awards are confirmatory  the producer paul espinosa is also well known and has been likewise honored for his work  the   film  in fact  won and deserved a number of awards  first place  audience favorite at the santa barbara film festival in   first place at the cairo film festival  and a number of other well deserved awards   in my opinion this film and dvd  earth  by perez is the best chicano film that has been made
