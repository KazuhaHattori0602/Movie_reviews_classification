many years ago i saw this movie  on television maybe  and loved it  so i decided to rent it on dvd the other day to see whether it still held up in my estimation  it did    set in sydney s notorious king s cross district  where prostitution  drug abuse and sex stores thrive  it tells the story of  jimmy   played by heath ledger  jimmy is a young man maybe late teens or thereabouts  who hasn t had a stable family background  he is on the fringes of society  and works as a  tout  for a sex club  encouraging people to enter the store  he is aware of an underworld figure called  pando  who is a local bigwig in the cross  it s jimmy s hope that he will find himself on pando s radar and get  in  with him a short cut to upward social mobility  he hopes   one night jimmy meets the beautiful young woman alex  played by the charming rose byrne  you just know that a love story will play out between them  on that night as well  jimmy is first contacted by pando  played by bryan brown  pando has a  job  for jimmy  it s the  foot in the door  that jimmy has been waiting for   to reveal too much more would spoil the many surprises that this movie has in store for the viewer  stylistically  if you like quentin tarantino or guy ritchie movies  you should be in tune with what to expect twists and turns and black comedy   what s so great about this movie is its very  australian ness  it s no mere knock off of tarantino or ritchie  but a genuine australian contribution to the genre    a fascinating aspect to this movie is how it all hangs together  sometimes you are introduced to characters who you wonder what the hell they re doing there  in the end  all these  loose ends  tie together beautifully  it s sort of like a celluloid moebius strip   a highlight of the movie is bryan brown s character of pando  pando likes puzzles  and it s fun to see him play games with his cronies  it s the little details revealed about him which are so enjoyable his taste in music  for starters   of the heath ledger movies i have seen  the dark knight    things i hate about you  this is perhaps his best role  wasn t taken with   things  if you are a heath ledger fan  ledger recently died a tragic  accidental death  this is a chance to see him in his greatest australian role  i think  there is great chemistry between ledger and byrne in this movie so  on one level  it functions as nice love story   this movie doesn t have some of the horror of tarantino and ritchie underworld movies  but it does have some adult themes scenes that surprise you with their coldness and beauty  in that sense  it s not an ideal movie for very young viewers  but it s not a movie that gore hounds will get excited about either    lastly  i have to say that it is great that australia can make great movies like this  usually the kind of movies my home country makes can be uniniviting  this movie has strengths where many australian movies have weaknesses i e  it has a great story  great acting and a great script  we need more popular  quality movies like this to be made here in australia    highly recommended  other australian movies i have loved include   breaker morant   mad max     my brilliant career  not reviewed here by me yet  proof  nr  the devil s playground  nr  the year my voice broke  nr  bad boy bubby  nr  a great  dark comedy  the dish  nr  a great  charming comedy
