helges best movie by far  very funny  very surrealistic  if bunuel made a movie starring buster keaton as krusty the clown it would look like this   brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies  especially helmut k rschgen as the sidekick of  schneider   andreas kunze who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though  and of course helge himself as nihil baxter is absolutely incredible   p s  if this movie had a proper merchandising i would really like to buy a replica of that  holz ist  painting
