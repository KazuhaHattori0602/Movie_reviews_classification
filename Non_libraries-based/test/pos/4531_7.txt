the  th and last rko falcon film starts with the mutual injunction by tom conway as tom lawrence alias the falcon and ed brophy as goldie of  no dames  whilst they prepare to go on vacation  while you re still wondering what they re going on vacation from as they hadn t had a job since the beginning of the  st film in    with sanders as gay though and jenkins as goldie  they bump into a woman and get dragged into a seedy industrial espionage caper   they promise to help her when her uncle is murdered  by taking an envelope containing the details of a formula to make substitute industrial diamonds to his business colleague in miami  suspect everyone here except the cops here who are after lawrence   and goldie for the murder  to console himself goldie keeps paraphrasing travel brochures   on the coldest day you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cosy electric chair  for one  some nice languid atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some especially bad behaviour from the baddies  favourite bit  the dignified game of hide and seek hunt the thimble the imperturbable and suave lawrence has with the baddies on the sleeper train  least favourite bit  the most embarrassing scene in the entire series in the alligator wrestling hut   definitely thrown in for the kids   all in all not the best in the series but yet another entertaining outing  with an overall satisfying plot and many episodes even in this that make me wish they could have gone on for just a few more years as columbia did with boston blackie  although rko were churning these out faster  absolutely no sex  not much violence  in fact none at all by today s high standards  and positively no message all make this type of film anathema to serious people who can only regard movies as an art form that must depend on these three pillars   three diet falcon s were made later with john calvert in the title role  i don t mind them but could never bring myself to count them into the main series  which tom conway had made his own by this time  sad also that it was all downhill after this for conway  who moved into tv  voice overs and even played norman conquest in park plaza   rather well in   he also developed serious eye and alcohol problems   i don t know if they were linked   wound up poverty stricken and after a spell in hospital in   was found dead in his girlfriend s bed  for us folk that want to at least we still have his   entertaining falcon s plus a number of other worthy  even classic rko movies from   to   with which to remember him by
