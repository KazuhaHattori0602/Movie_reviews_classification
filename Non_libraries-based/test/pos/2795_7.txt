 spoilers ahead   it is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be  such a disappointment  i thought this was full of  silly  clich s and  that it basically tried to hard    to the  american  guys out there  how many of you spend your  time jumping on your girlfriend s bed and making monkey  sounds  to the  married  girls  how many of you have suddenly  gone from prudes to nymphos overnight but not with your  husband  to the french  would you really ask about someone  being   la fac  when you know they don t speak french  wouldn t  you use a more common word like  universit    i lived in france for a while and i sort of do know and understand  europe  and i love it  but my  german  roommate and i found this  pretty insulting overall  it looked like a movie funded by the  european parliament  and it tried too hard basically  it had all  sorts of differences that it tried to tie together  not a bad thing in  itself  but the result is at best awkward  but in fact ridiculous too  many clashes that wouldn t really happen  then the end of the  movie the last   minutes ruined all the rest  why doesn t xavier  talk to the erasmus students he meets back in paris  why does  he just walk off  why does he just run away from his job  is that   freedom  and in the end  is the new europe supposed to rest on  a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day  is this what  it s made up of    besides  the acting was pretty horrible  i can t believe judith  godr che s role and acting  why was she made to look like  emanuelle b art so much  at first i thought xavier was ok but  with retrospect i think he was pretty bad    and that s all really too bad  because technically  opening credits   scenes when he s asking what papers he needs  it was really  good  except for sound editing around the british siblings  and the  soundtrack was great too  so the form was good  but the content  pretty horrible
