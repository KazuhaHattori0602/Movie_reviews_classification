this world war ii popeye cartoon had some very good sight gags in it  and its decidedly above average for its genre  it was nicely drawn  too  with some great angles  good detail and well  lots of interesting sights   what it amounts to is popeye out at sea in his little boat and accidentally running into a small japanese boat  with two guys on it   incidentally  why were the  japs  always pictured with big  round glasses and bucked teeth    anyway  these harmless looking japanese sailors want popeye to sign a peace treaty  oh  boy  thinks the gullible popeye   wait until the admiral sees this  in one of those great artwork scenes i was alluding to above  we slowly see how that little japanese ship is really a big destroyer and popeye is in deep um  water   why  you double crossing ja pansies  yells our sailor man   how he gets out of the situation is fun to watch
