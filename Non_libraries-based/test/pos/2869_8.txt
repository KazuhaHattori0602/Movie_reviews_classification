see no evil with kane  the movie has a great storyline but it just wasn t a hide my eye s  scream out loud horror flick i thought it was going to be from watching the wwe superstars on monday night raw when the movie first came to theaters  i did enjoy the movie though i loved the story it played out   great movie excellent would like to see a part     it doesn t matter if kane gets killed at the end  or not they have killed off other horror stars in every movie   they have out and they still comeback for more so a part   would  be very interesting
