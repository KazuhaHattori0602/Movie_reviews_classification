this film  like much of their music  is either underrated or unnoticed by the casual observer  it is terrific and  in many ways  ahead of its time   the images are funny  disturbing  and at the very least  engaging    the music is amazing    this is not the  candy pop  sound they are unfortunately associated with  this is the sound of a band in exploration and revolt   head  alone  should put the monkees into the rock and roll hall of fame    can anyone tell me why these guys are not in there
