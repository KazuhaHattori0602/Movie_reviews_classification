i have seen this film more then once  actually el padrino was one of the best feature films that i have seen in a great deal of time   there was a big cast jennifer tilly  faye duanway  brad dourif  and damian chapa who really shined like a real star in this part of kilo   i heard this film was shot for under two million dollars  i have seen films shot for   million that cant compare to the quality and production value   damian chapa why are you not getting offers and more film work  excellent job  i cant wait to see the sequel  and i hope it has the same action   jennifer tilly has made a cult classic character with sabeva   damian chapa moves coolly in every scene much like the movie stars of the  s and  s so sick of seeing these non charismatic actors like ben stiller getting all of these films when there is talent like this that have something to show  a great film   go go go kick some but in sales el padrino
