this short film  and the poem which is behind it  is one of the greatest metaphors i ve ever seen    the poem is beautiful  it describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and can t realize it
 but it also tells how to fulfil it  i see the  story of the cat and the moon  as one beautiful metaphor to the human relationships  passion and love    technically it s done a good work too  in spite of being very simple  the animation  in black and white  gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message  but also of tenderness and nostalgia    in addiction  the music also contributes to this poetic feeling     nothing else matters  i will wait  she will come when she can  or when she wants to
