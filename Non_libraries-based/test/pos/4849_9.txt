mpaa rating pg   my rating    and up  my   rating    william h  macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of mr  neuman  he makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously  the story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that macy effortly masters  i couldn t take my eyes off this film even after it ended  and i couldn t beleive it ended when it did  a must to see   this paragraph may be considered a spoiler by some  after you watch the film  look at the plot this way  the neumans are the united states as a whole  and the charactor meat loaf aday plays is the people in the united states who are anti semetic   this was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone i saw in the street
