background info   the movies octopussy   never say never again were both made the same year    and so naturally people compare them  moore vs  connery  bond vs  bond   i ve heard many people claiming that the  official movie  octopussy is far superior  well  i just watched octopussy  bond is riding an airplane at   miles an hour  impossible the wind would blow him off  using his feet to force the plane to ground  and then jumping off at some   miles an hour  again impossible try jumping out of your car you d end up with a shattered body  how is that octopussy scene supposed to be  good  in any sense of the word  suddenly bond has super human strength   a titanium body  and he does all these stunts at the ancient age of   complete crap  unbelievable  farse     now let s contrast the above scene with connery s  unofficial  never say never again  it doesn t have the same polish due to its independent film status  less money  but at least you can believe that connery is a real spy in real danger   the movie starts off with bond showing his age  he is   after all  and being sent off for recuperation  entirely believable  but of course  there s no such thing as a  day off  for a world famous spy  and bond quickly finds himself a target  even inside the hospital  from that point the story spins off into another adventure  with bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons   as usual sean connery did a brilliant job  and avoids the over the top unbelievable stunts  this movie feels like a natural successor to connery s last film   s diamonds are forever  the old style of bond  before the franchise got silly   highyly recommended
