i spotted this film in a branch of the duane reed pharmacy in new york on holiday  and it seemed like a bit of silly fun  and sure enough  the whole premise is ridiculous beyond words   but it turned out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action film for kids  and their parents too    year old ricky bernard  jordan garrett  has his head in the clouds most of the time  much to his father s  larry miller  dismay  as a member of his school orchestra  ricky and schoolmates fly to a concert performance   and once again ricky s mind  takes off  and suspects some criminal plot is happening   reluctantly aided by best friend sashi  who is a fan of hot sauce  what a strange plot device that was  and others they try to get to solve the mystery  oh yes  and ricky s skills   hours of flight simulator experience prove to be handy when he is called on to save the day in the film s thrilling climax  it was good to see eric roberts and mark dacoscos play parts in a family film  and watching the dvd interviews everyone seems to have had great fun taking part   i totally liked junior pilot  charming and good natured performances  funny plot line and a real  sense of enjoyment and sheer silliness   if you are looking for an entertaining family film  you could do far worse than buy this one
