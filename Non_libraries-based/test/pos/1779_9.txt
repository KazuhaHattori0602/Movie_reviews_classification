 identity          i am part of my surroundings and i became separate from them and it s being able to make those differentiations clearly that lets us have an identity and what s inside our identity is everything that s ever happened to us   ntozake shange qtd in  fires in the mirror   pieces like decalogue v used to intimidate me  i felt that if i accepted them  than i would be compromising something  what i thought before really isn t worth getting into  i understand what naturalism is trying to say  i experienced a tangible katharsis  and one that fell into existence piecemeal  and one that s still alive  that i still have to reckon with  it s still working inside me    the film wasn t sympathetic  per se  it doesn t need to say that the death penalty is a wicked thing  there are certainly wicked people  whether or not they should die is for another film  what decalogue shows is that good  beautiful people exists who kill other people when their society and primal urges jack them up    the  science  of naturalism is what has helped me to appreciate decalogue v  it s not worth the writing space to go into why i would not let myself before  but i see now the worth in making art like this to  make  people  or perhaps to make people do something    there s a method to lazar s compromise of his       light  much of that meaning makes sense only in retrospect  this should not be too strange of an idea  after all  how much of respectable science does not gain meaning in retrospect  i wince when i say it  but naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when i have the power to say to myself   this ruin  this process  this natural process  makes me want to buck the system    i do not think naturalism is painting a doomsday portrait of humanity  telling us to give up our powdered wigs and head to the woods  instead  i think that it is cataloging proofs and experiments  that we are  of course  free to ignore  we can ignore it all we want  if we want to give the naturalists more corpses to bury    for surely  despite their aesthetic specifically designed without sympathy towards their characters  likely and catastrophic fate  they are impassioned by readerly inaction and writerly snobisme  i do see the delightful risk in the hope that the audience will understand what s to be done with what they see  as has been mentioned  there s danger in the hopeless seeing their fate immortalized in stone  there s danger in the hopeful disparaging the natural because it doesn t correspond to their world view   and i don t think that the  hopeful  need be either wealthy or fortunate  i have not seen it  but it seems that the film american beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstance as a provider of vision or comfort  there are ascetics as well as gluttons as well as beggars who wonder where within themselves their humanity is  who grieve because they can t find anything that separates them from their landscape    landscapes can be powerfully and beautifully portrayed  but in reality  landscapes do not enact  they change  sure  and dramatically  but only by a large set of natural law which no one truly have power over  but it cannot be changed itself
