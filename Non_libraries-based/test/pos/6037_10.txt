alex benedict  john cassavetes  is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist  when she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn t leave his wife  he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide  too bad for him our rumpled detective  lt  columbo  peter falk  is on the case   stephen bochco has written another razor sharp episode for the series  following marvelous detail with marvelous detail  we watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty five minutes  and we re completely engrossed  then when columbo appears on the scene  it gets even better   we first see columbo after the murder  as per usual  this time he s at the vet with his new dog  scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show  think columbo s discomfort over the nude model in  suitable for framing  columbo is hilarious when he s dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry  but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he s with non suspects  bochco  by contrast  shows columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story   and i m grateful he didn t strain for a punchline to columbo s quest to give the dog a name  as far as we learn  the dog remains nameless  bochco gives columbo some of his best moments in this episode  and peter falk makes the most of them  he s particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself  much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist  and he s even better in his scenes playing cat and mouse with cassavetes  that these two long time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected  and that s what we get  notice how alex benedict can t help but admire the deceptively dimwitted columbo  even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck   bochco makes the most of every situation in his script  when columbo goes to question benedict s snooty mechanic  of course   of course    he asks the man to look at his own beat up heap  and when benedict finds columbo at the hollywood bowl before rehearsal  of course   of course    he s on the piano playing  chopsticks  and what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim s typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller   columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl  dawn frame  and the lovely blythe danner  who plays cassavetes s wife  it s nice to see myrna loy show up as danner s mother  though she does little with her minor role   the director nicholas colasanto  who also acted  most notably as coach in  cheers  does a perfectly creditable job  though he follows the lead of nearly every other  columbo  director by adding one or two silly flourishes  scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus  then there s that bit where cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime   and we see a zoom in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses  there s also one scene with myrna loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except cassavetes   these are quibbles  though  this is a splendidly entertaining episode  the kind that made me a  columbo  fan
