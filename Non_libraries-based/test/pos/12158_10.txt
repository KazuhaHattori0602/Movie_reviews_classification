has there ever been an angel of death like mimsy farmer in barbet schroeder s  s heroin opus  sort of jean seberg with a hypodermic  pink floyd score  despite some ultimately insignificant weaknesses  a classic  shamelessly ripped off by erich segal noel black for their inept jennifer on my mind   although tippy walker  playing a similar character  is herself very junkie appealing in the latter mess  more  though  is terrific  a great  s drug movie and  simply  an important document of its time  very much a cult film so join the cult   no american movie then  as far as i can remember  charts the same territory  mimsy s an astonishing archetype  elevating this into mythic realms  not for the faint hearted  great sex scenes too
