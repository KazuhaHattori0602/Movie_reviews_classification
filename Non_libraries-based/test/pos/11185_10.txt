the curse of monkey island  released excactly   years after the success of monkey island   you would think with monkey island  s wierd ending that it would finish monkey island once and for all  but  it all turned out to be a trick to lure guybrush into captivity  but enough about that  the whole jist of this is that monkey island has returned  and the voices are just phenominal  if lucasarts were to make a movie cartoon of monkey island  this would probably be what it would look like  and sound like  it s plot is real good  and everything about it is just awesome  if you haven t heard about the monkey island series  buy the monkey island archives or the monkey island booty pack and play through all the games starting with the secret of monkey island  then monkey island   and the curse of monkey island  monkey island   was real good  but this one tops them all
