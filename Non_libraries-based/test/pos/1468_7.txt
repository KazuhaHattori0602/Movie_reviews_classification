this british documentary was recently shown on comedy central during their  best of
  week and can also be seen on south park s second season dvd  i remember seeing many commercials for the dvd showing clips of this documentary  most of which occurs with matt stone  trey parker  and some other guy in a hot tub  it was funny when i saw it in the commercials  but i was used to seeing it by the time i saw the actual documentary   overall   goin  down to south park  is a fairly funny and interesting look at how south park episodes are made and of the series  history going back to when matt and trey came up with the idea in college  however  there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt sort of depressing  it s not as fast paced  rapid fire  and as lively as the actual south park episodes  instead  it kind of has a slow  dry wit style  which at times can be funny  but most of the time you re just waiting for something to happen  if you get the chance to watch it  by all means go for it  but i don t think you re really missing much if you never see it   my imdb rating
