chucky s back and it s about time  this time  with the help of jennifer tilly and a little spell from voodoo for dummies  well  at least with this installment  the camp is back  this was the more gruesome of this series  so far  it has some good twists and some good action scenes    this one was by far  the most fun of the series  and successfully  if unintentionally  bridges the gap between pure horror to horror comedy    i am looking forward to seed of chucky  it ll be a hoot    jesus  the music scene s gone to h ll since i ve been dead  chucky  we needed the levity  as the doll thing s getting old  the added comedic element  and the better action scenes brings this one back up to equal the quality of the first  when the idea was fresh and new ish     from   the fiend
