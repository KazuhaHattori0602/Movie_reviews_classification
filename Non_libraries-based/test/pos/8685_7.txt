algernon s comment that ms paget s  ultra lewd dance in  this film  is the most erotic in the history of films  is certainly one doozy of an exaggeration  it isn t even debra paget s most erotic dance  her near nude gyrations in fritz lang s  the indian tomb  make this number look decidedly tame  as for being the most erotic in the history of dance  well  where do i start  salma hayek s performance as santanico pandemonium in  from dusk to dawn    jamie lee curtis in  true lies    jessica alba in  sin city    rose mcgowan in  terror planet    sheila kelley in  dancing at the blue iguana    blah  blah  blah   don t get me wrong  i love the sequence and have included it in my  cheesecake dance  series on youtube  i just think that making a claim like  most erotic in the history of film  is really going out on a very fragile limb
