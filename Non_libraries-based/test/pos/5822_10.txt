oz  is one of the most mind blowing and addictive tv experiences ever   having caught pieces of this on sbs  i was at first skeptical  however  having finished now the  th season  i sadly know that that this brilliant show is approaching its end    seasons  and yet i still can t get enough of oz    want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit oz fits the bill  hands down   this isn t kid s stuff  folks  its violent  brutal  and not pretty  why  its a experimental unit inside a maximum security prison   tom fontana s oz is brilliant in all the right departments  the actors  the writing  and directing   hbo s oz site is also highly recommended  for newcomers  for info about this series  this was the first one hour show  produced by hbo  and it proves what a master work it is and that others would follow   thank you hbo
