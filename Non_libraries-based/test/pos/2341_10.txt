a truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life  it could be set in any town in the uk    i live in a housing estate in glasgow and can relate to this film very well   sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable   the actors are scarily believable  i felt as if i was spying on my neighbours  it was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people  i was very moved by a few scenes   i loved the way this film was shot   overall this film is a must see
