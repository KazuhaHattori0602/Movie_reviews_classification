mr bean was great fun  i loved it  every episode was really funny  rowan atkinson was perfect for this role  he s a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious    the series was so successful that they even made a mr bean movie in   which was also pretty funny by the way    it s funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into  this series was a classic for sure  and i still watch an episode from time to time   mr bean is well worth a   in my book  fans of offbeat comedy must check this out
