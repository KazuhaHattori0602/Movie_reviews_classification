i watched the premiere of  path to paradise  way back and was stunned by it  dramatic license and all  i lived in nyc  brooklyn  a few years and kept in mind  today  given the links to groups such as al queda  hamas  and the islamic jihad  i see it as a warning not recognized by our government  for that i place the blame on our bureaucracy and leaders    was a new tactic to behead two of our branches of gov t and there is no excuse for our gov t to prevent it  period   path to paradise  was but a dramatic view of the   preview  and no one cared  now  nearly   deaths later  and years behind  we struggle to find an answer that is decades to resolve
