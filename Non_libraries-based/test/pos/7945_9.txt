i saw this film back in the early  s and i was mesmerised by judy geeson  for me it captured the clandestine nature of rod steigers irrepressible obsession with the young and extremely sexy hitch hiker  played by geeson   you couldn t help feel a little sorry for the wife  played brilliantly by claire bloom  i was really disappointed to see that the original cut may have been lost and there is little chance of it being released on dvd   i defy anyone who saw the film  and it s strong message not to be equally absorbed by the three main character performances  and i would have loved to have seen it again  if nothing else for a purely nostalgic reason   going back in time  some   years   a real classic
