this is a very visual film  by that i mean that the dialog is sparse  almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes  beginning with the opening shot   the silences  however  are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant  staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins  and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams  it s a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes  one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street  so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman  that he walks into a lamppost  one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store   a long time ago  another movie   love story     said that love is never having to say you re sorry  this narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways  beginning with the main character  titta  toni sevillo  a seemingly innocuous long term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in switzerland  everyday  week in  week out  he sits at the same coffee table  enjoying the passing world  his cigarettes  his coffee  his solitude   and he s been doing it for ten years  he sits  he observes  and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you ll find out about when you see this little masterpiece   love is explored in another way  in a direct counterpoint to titta s solitude and reserved nature  two older residents of the hotel are still much in love  but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes  while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests  one of whom is titta  now  titta knows about their squabbles  their love  the man s cheating  his apologies to his wife  and his whining  how  in a surprising and black comedic manner one of those surprise activities i mentioned   but  this is no comedy  in reality  although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a balzacian sense  the irony of life and what to do with it  that decision had been made for titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel  he keeps in touch occasionally  and it is clear that he still loves his children  now grown up  and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes  but  there s something more than just sorrow   such a life as titta s would obviously seem to be utterly boring  and it actually is from many perspectives  it is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death like countenance  however  that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes  but not before we know that the female bartender  sofia  olivia magnani  is very interested in titta and goes out of her way to pique titta s interest in her   and that s when things start to unravel for titta  he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers  once again  the consequences of love  ironically  in doing so  he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life  and in a most spectacular fashion   i know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic  but  to say more would spoil the film and story for you  if you like italian cinema   i love it    i urge you to see this one  the acting is superb  the sound track chills the spine  the camera work is truly innovative  the direction shows the maturity of a true artist   i know i ll see this movie again  and again
