if i d only seen the poster for nurse betty  i probably wouldn t have touched it with a ten foot pole  but after i heard some positive buzz  and knowing it made some noise at cannes  i decided to give it a try  what i got is a truly enjoyable movie  based on a very entertaining plot  rene zelleweger is impressive in her role as  nurse  betty  a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience  i also liked morgan freeman  no surprise  and was pleasantly surprised by foul mouthed comedian chris rock    the film bounces continuously between comedy  drama  romance  and thriller  yet despite this apparent identity crisis  it holds up quite well  i found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story  the entire cast is strong  if not spectacular    my only real complaint is that director neil labute  who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark  in the company of men  relied much too heavily on many cliched hollywood conventions  the mood creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable  and he did the standard old  let s take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance  trick  just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face  why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots   but the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations  in a very subpar year for movies   nurse betty  ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of     out of
