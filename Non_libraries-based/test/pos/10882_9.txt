this game is not exactly the best n  game ever  sure  it s good  but only when there s   players  without   players  the only fun thing to do is take remote mines and see how many people you can kill  but half of this game are levels where you have to save natalya  so you ll have to limit your use of remote mines in those levels  and that gets quite boring  the graphics don t exactly reach the level of super mario   or even mario kart   and if you re talking a great multiplayer in a  st person shooter  you ll have to go with perfect dark  at least you can play  multiplayer  by yourself
