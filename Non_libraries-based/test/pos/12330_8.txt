i can t describe the feeling when i got this crappy vhs rental cassette in my hands about   years ago  somehow i got my father to rent it for me and i watched it twice with my little brother  yes  we got nightmares  this film was originally rated as pg in the us  in many other countries  including finland  it was restricted under   or   the film was aimed to teenagers  but this must be the goriest pg rated film ever  there s no bad language or nudity in it what so ever  originally made in   stayed on the shelves for a couple of years before release   this is an a class b movie  a true  well made  s horror flick  a bunch of college girls decide to spent a night in a mausoleum  not knowing that a supernatural evil awaits    you can almost smell the rotting flesh and feel the atmosphere of this movie  it s campy  utterly stupid  but they just can t make these movies anymore  there is definitely a certain feel to this  s horror genre  this one is still effectively spooky and entertaining after all these years   the effects are just oozing quality by ellis burman jr and thomas r  burman  the make up effects play a big part in this flick  otherwise it would ve been just a boring teen slasher   it s now available on dvd at last and it s a special edition dvd including some extras too  commentary track is interesting    in fact  this version isn t so special after all  below average transfer on dvd  some glitches and scratches here and there  at first it was going to be released by the blue underground but unfortunately it was canceled  so shriek show released it without restoring the print  too bad   great date movie   recommended   note  i only gave   out of   because of the  nostalgic values  otherwise   out of
