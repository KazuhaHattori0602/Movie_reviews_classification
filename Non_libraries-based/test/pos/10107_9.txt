i love horror films  but i think they work way better when they hide a dramatic impact behind  the devil s backbone  the exorcist  for example  this is that kind of film  and it s not only eerie and terrifying when it has to be  it is also really beautiful  a tale of two sisters starts really slow  so if you re in a hurry to see ghosts in the first   minutes you will be disappointed  actually this is not a ghost story  though there are some  it s something more complex  and it s done in such a way that it beats ringu and the grudge out of the ring no sweat  a tale
 is a way more clever film than those huge cultural hits  because it really cares for its characters  and the direction is flawless  every detail in this film will leave you breathless if you re the kind of person who loves to pay attention to details while watching a movie  the acting is superb  specially from the stepmother and the main girl  those two are worth the price of the ticket alone  do yourself a favor and watch this awesome film
