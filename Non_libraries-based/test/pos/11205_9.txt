this is a film about loneliness and how the distance   physical and emotional   between people tends to stultify relationships   the narrative is simple to the point of banality  a young man yusuf  emin toprak  from a rural village  arrives in istanbul to stay with his older and successful cousin mahmut  muzaffer ozdemir  yusuf wants work in the big city  after trying for a few weeks to find work without any success  the strain of having yusuf living with him is too much for mahmut  they quarrel   nothing physical  just verbal  eventually  yusuf goes  leaving mahmut alone again  end of story   except for the fact that the performance of the two men as relatives is one of the best on film  much is said visually  dialog is used to bring out disagreement  distrust  hostility  and insecurity that exist within and between the two men   there are many visual gems in this film  for example  while searching for work  young yusuf  needing a relationship  tries in vain to gain the attention of various young women around the city  the look on his face  as he is thwarted every time  says it all   or  wanting a cigarette  yusuf opens the door to the balcony of mahmut s apartment and lights up in the frigid december air  leaving the door open  mahmut  eventually gets up from his work desk  walks to the door  all glass  and the cousins just look at each other for what seems way too long a time  then mahmut closes the door  leaving yusuf out in the cold  the metaphor is complete   or  mahmut cleaning up after yusuf  grudgingly and with increasing anger  and all the while  yusuf wastes his time chasing skirts instead of looking seriously for work  and spends mahmut s money on a toy for a nephew
 yusuf is emotional  untidy  impulsive  and vulnerable  mahmut is rational  logical  self confident and a demanding control freak  the right brain  left brain dichotomy beautifully played out by two actors who say more with a look  a gesture  a frown than any words can convey   but  mahmut is not completely emotionless  he still loves his ex wife who tells him that she s off to canada with her husband to be  mahmut affects a distant and confident friendship with his ex  and makes sure that she is okay about going  he wishes her well  he says goodbye  he leaves the coffee shop where they were talking  later when she calls to say a last goodbye  on the way to the airport  mahmut goes there and secretly watches as she leaves  the poignancy of the emotion on his face  as she disappears through a door  is worth the wait   all in all  this is a standout piece of work by the two main actors and the director  nuri ceylan  some might argue that the pace is too slow  but life goes slowly for much of the time  especially for those who are alone  the camera work is relatively simple also  choose the scene  set up the camera and lighting  and let the actors move across the scene  enter the scene and leave the scene  all the while keeping the camera still  there were a few panning shots  some high angle tracking shots  a few rural scenes   but much of the film is shown as though on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens  except for tv and radio music within the story  there is no music sound track  and  there are those many long silences as the two men sit and watch tv together and or engage in very limited conversation   i saw this movie on tv so i was amused to see that  on a few occasions  i was watching tv as they were watching tv also  the silence in the movie matched the silence in my house  i was awake  all others in bed  my chair and position matched that of mahmut s as he watched tv  quite eerie  giving me a sense of almost  being there  with him
 and  i guess i was  in a sense   i ll say no more  because i want you to savor the other scenes that i haven t described  it s not a movie for everybody  for sure  more than any movie i ve seen  it shows just how much we die when we are all alone   just as we are all alone when we die  mahmut s face  as it fades to black in the final scene  will stay with me for a long  long time   highly recommended for serious movie buffs
