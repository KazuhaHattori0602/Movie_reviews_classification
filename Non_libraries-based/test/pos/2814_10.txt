at initial thought  the concept of this show seemed to be a joke and a gag  just for stan lee s amusement  i expected nothing more than a sleazy  animated version of barb wire with low production values  much like those short pieces of crap you see on adult swim for short term amusement  but can never taken too seriously  boy was i wrong   stripperella has even better production values than similar marvel toons  the animation is very good and it seems that they ve taken this series very seriously and given it a full effort to make it a professional production as possible   the humor is good too  on the sexy  suggestive and sleazy side  it is very similar if not exactly like the simpsons style  you may encounter clich s and a lot of predictable humor but its still fun nevertheless  if this were running today  i d surely see it regularly  its surprisingly one of the better toons ever made
