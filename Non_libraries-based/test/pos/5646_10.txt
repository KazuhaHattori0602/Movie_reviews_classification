my first ichikawa in many years  and the first of his war films that i ve seen  this was gripping and brutal from the very get go  in the very first scene  nominal hero tamura is told that he can t continue on with his unit  to which he has returned from the hospital  he apparently has tb   but he is not sick enough for the hospital to take him given the quantity of war wounded they have  but his old unit won t take him back either  his co gives him a grenade  and tells him that if he feels truly hopeless to blow himself up
it s the honorable thing to do   the phillipines    and the situation really does seem hopeless  for pfc tamura and everyone else  nobi is an odyssey through hell  or rather hells   denuded forests  dead rocky plains  and the dead and dying japanese soldiers hoping just for an end  through peace or death  ichikawa s film is photographed in stunning b w scope which serves to highlight both the desolation felt by tamura and those he meets on his journey towards his doom  and to show how truly small and naked they all are amidst the immensity of the mountains and the forests
 this small affair of humans will end soon  the earth seems to be saying  but i will survive and barely notice it   tamura travels back towards the hospital  but is  not surprisingly  rejected there  and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive  stay human  and get out of danger  he doesn t manage to do very well on any account  slowly starving and eventually committing some fairly repellent acts  eventually he hooks up with two other desperate men who have lost  or survived their units  and have resorted to cannibalism
and in his weakened state facing other armed men  finds that the only way to live is to break with everything that he believes in   ichikawa s film is as brutal  uncompromising and intense as any war film i ve seen  there are moments of humor and tenderness  but they are fleeting and don t stick in the memory such as the scene with the man on the mountaintop who practically begs tamura to eat his flesh
the recurring black comic bit with tamura exchanging his ragged shoes for the better leathers of a fallen comrade
 the degradations that humans will endure to survive
 the truth that this is any war  all wars  all mankind as long as we continue thus  a masterpiece that i probably won t watch again for a long  long time  watched via the beautiful criterion collection dvd
