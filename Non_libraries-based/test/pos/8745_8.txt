i ve read innumerable reviews talking about the superiority of the mini series  i certainly can t agree on such a blanket statement  if you analyze all of the aspects of a video film production  there are numerable areas where the film is arguably vastly superior   certainly  many of the comments are valid with regard to particular areas of the mini series  specifically regarding more threads  customs officers  and more developed threads  such as the pakistani farmer and family  that said  i found catherine zeta jones  character much more compelling as the desperate women  from poverty to riches who  won t go back  that s a much more likable character than this cold women who didn t seem to have as much reason for her quick turn to evil   and yes  i understand her children  she was desperate  i just didn t see her as being as desperate   further  while i appreciated some of the more fleshed out story threads in the mini series  benicio del toro s character was very compelling  an anchor for the film  that thread was changed  as an alternative to the pakistani family  in nothing but good ways  a fantastic adaptation   of course  i m skeptical that someone so pure can exist within such a system  but i don t know enough about the politics of the nation to argue   after watching the first episode of the mini series  i actually rewatched the film  why  i kept reading about the fantastic acting  i found the performances in the first episode of the mini series to be borderline laughable  certainly  this improved as the mini series progressed  now having just finished both versions in a few days  i can t agree that the performances in the mini series reached the same level as  say  benicio del toro  who was brilliant in the film  though ormand  paterson  shah  and lindsay duncan were very good  i also feel the police in the film far outclassed the mini series  i was not impressed with the germans throughout   finally  the dialogue  as delivered in the film  is much more nuanced  especially in the scenes which are almost verbatim   careful  you re beginning to sound like your husband  as opposed to  hahahaha  you sound like karl  again  i found some of the acting in the mini  series very unconvincing  this was a prime example   other superior aspects of the film  in my opinion  score  cinematography  editing   should i complain that the film wasn t longer  no  i think it was a fantastic adaptation given the format  the changes made stood on their own  i mean  would you sit in a theater for     hours  of course not   mini series    out of    film    out of
