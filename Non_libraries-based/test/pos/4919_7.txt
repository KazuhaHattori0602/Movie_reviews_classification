to be honest fellow imdb reviewers  i enjoyed this show a lot  the reason  well  it didn t try to be more than it is  i mean  a sitcom with regular expectations  with a well known and repeated plot  funny and talented actors  and clever jokes oriented for a post college audience   this is what grown ups is all about  trying to be mature but in a funny way   jaleel white is funny as always and delivers some witty  and hilarious sex oriented jokes  the humor is very  s without taking in account the tendencies of the new millennium and that s the main reason in my opinion why the show didn t have success  it got stuck in the  s   oh and mrs  ribisi was really funny and perky   my favorite show has to be the one that deals with karma biting the ass  not a cult classic but i m sure it s part of regular early  s nostalgia
