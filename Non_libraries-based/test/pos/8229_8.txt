i read ashew s comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture    i just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised   to address ashew s comments   trail street is a very well done western   and randolph scott was in it quite a bit    gabby hayes was funnier than i ve ever seen him    the bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as i was concerned   plus   it was interesting to see robert ryan as a straight laced good guy   he s usually so slimy   in all  a good western  very well acted and written   i liked the background story of kansas and the  winter wheat  that supposedly helped it become a state  too   i thought the girl who played susan was lovely   can t think why she didn t become a bigger star
