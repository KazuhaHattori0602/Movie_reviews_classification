i would love for members of the cast and crew to sit down and do an audio commentary on this movie  all of the different places that they went to film this movie  should provide for some very good anecdotes  fans of this movie would love to know   what kind of permission did they have to get to film at certain locations   were there any memorable outtakes   were there any scenes that were deleted   what challenges did the cast and the crew face   did any actors have stunt doubles   what was it like to work with other members of the cast   were any of the scenes ad libbed   what are members of the cast and crew up to now   what locations are still there  and what locations are no longer there  or are now a different business   it is one thing to read trivia about this movie on this site and other web sites  but there is just no comparison to getting it straight from the horse s mouth   come on  guys  get together and do a commentary  never walk away from a challenge  go for the gusto
