i d been postponing purchasing this one ever since its dvd release   for one thing  because i d been somewhat underwhelmed by this director s two other horror titles  squirm [ ] and blue sunshine [ ]  but also the fact that the film itself is said to have been slightly trimmed for gore on the media blasters shriek show  disc set  i now chanced upon it as a rental and am glad i did   because  not only is it superior to the earlier efforts  at least  on this preliminary assessment  but i also found the film to be one of the better imitations of the texas chain saw massacre   this factor  however  only helped remind me that i ve yet to check out another such example   wes craven s classic the hills have eyes   whose  disc r  edition from anchor bay i purchased some time ago but  after all  halloween time is fast approaching    anyway  the film manages an effortlessly unsettling backwoods atmosphere  it was shot in the forest and mountain regions of oregon    with plenty of effective frissons throughout but  thankfully  not too much violence  even if the last of the villains is dispatched in quite an outrageous fashion  the principal young cast here  one of them played by jack lemmon s son  chris  isn t quite as obnoxious as those we usually encounter in this type of genre offering   despite freely indulging in the shenanigans one associates with teen oriented flicks and which  by and large  persist to this day  george kennedy appears as a sympathetic ranger  though he doesn t have a lot to do  his characterization is decidedly enhanced by making him a lover of plant and animal life  also notable among the locals is familiar character actor mike kellin in a nice role as the drunkard who first comes into contact with the murderous duo of the narrative   his warning to the teenagers  naturally  goes unheeded but he s later able to lead kennedy to them   the hermetic family the teens come across in the woods  then  is eventually revealed to be hiding a skeleton in their closet  while one of the girls displays genuine curiosity at the intruders  presence  the rest are openly hostile to them   and  in the case of the burly and uncouth twins  appropriately creepy  one of them is even prone to maniacal laughter during his rampages  at a certain point in the narrative  the ranger even offers an interesting explanation as to the nature of their aggressive and generally uncivilized behavior
