well  what to say   i think i shall start with a confession  i have cried   times in my life  once when my dad died  twice due to a girlfriend in high school  and at the end of this film  this film deals with the real confronting issues of   school kids  forcing them quite uncomfortably into the open for all the world to see  i have never seen a film that deals with the human emotional condition as well as this  everything from incest to incontinence is covered here and i doubt there are many people who are safe from the sting of familiarity with at least a couple of scenes   it starts off with a suicide  at  pm  then without letting you know who it was that died  the story begins to be told from the start of the day  it follows the lives of   school kids up until  pm  it interchangeably  and edited with personal interviews of the   teenagers  lets you know everything about their lives  their loves  hates  dreams  desires  secrets  shame  false confidence  self loathing  corruption and arrogance  the overall outcome of which is a sort of  whodunnit  trying to discover the identity of the suicidal before it is revealed at the end of the film  without spoiling anything i must let you know  do not feel cheated by the ending  it contains a very important lesson   and now a warning  this film is definitely not for the faint hearted  many people actually walked out of the cinema half way through when i saw it  disgusted by some of it s content  or perhaps it s that it s sometimes hard to face the cold hard truth of reality  this is what high school is like for many people  i m sure most would agree
