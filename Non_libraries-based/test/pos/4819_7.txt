what often threatens to turn into a soppy and soft headed drama about misunderstood middle class youth ends up a surprisingly shaded and subdued movie by john frankenheimer  his first  though he had started in television  directing among other things an earlier version of this script   we are still in those semi mythic  s when teenagers drove jalopies and jeans were still dungarees  james macarthur  adoptive son of playwright charles and actress helen hayes  and later to enter pop culture as hawaii  s danno  gets involved in a minor incident in a movie theater which escalates to his throwing a punch at the manager  whit bissell  and being booked down at the police station  his dad  james daly  a big shot movie producer gets the call  doesn t listen to his son s version of the story  and pulls strings to get him off   but macarthur keeps carrying a chip on his shoulder  which even his sympathetic mom  kim hunter  can t knock off  things worsen in the coldwater canyon homestead until macarthur  trying to vindicate himself  stages a reprise of the original incident   the movie doesn t quite avoid the attitudes   and cliches   of its time  but presents them with considerable nuance  every character gets an honorable hearing  every point of view has its merits  and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it  there are flaws  the word `crummy  a standard rebellious euphemism of the era  is used about   times too often  but they re outweighed by strengths  the movie benefits from a strong cast  most notable among them the excellent character actor james gregory  as a police detective  and a resolutely non exploitative way of telling its story  from a vantage point in the new millennium  the hot water macarthur finds himself in may seem a little tepid  but the young stranger remains honest and honorable
