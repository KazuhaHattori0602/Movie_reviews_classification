in many ways  the filmic career of independent film making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock  the consummate studio director  where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle  cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally  where every element in a hitchcock shot is composed immaculately  cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt  or what it conveyed  emotionally  hitchcock s tales were always plot first narratives  with the human element put in the background  cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films  if some things did not make much sense logically  so be it   one can see this even from his very first film   s shadows  filmed with a  mm hand held camera  on a shoe string budget of about   in manhattan  with cassavetes  acting workshop repertory company  and touted as an improvisatory film  the story is rather simple  as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites  benny  ben carruthers  a trumpeter and no account  hugh  hugh hurd  a washed up singer  and lelia  lelia goldoni  the younger sister of both  the film s three main arcs deal with hugh s failures as a nightclub crooner  and his friendship with his manager rupert  rupert crosse  benny s perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals  and lelia s lovelife  first with a white boy tony  anthony ray  who does not realize light skinned lelia s race  even after bedding her  then with stiff and proper davey  davey jones  who may be a misogynist   in the first arc  nothing much happens  except dark skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs  and opening shows for girly acts  he dreams of making it big in new york  or even paris  but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill  for the one time we actually get to hear him sing  he shows he s a marginal talent  at best  that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work  but  this is the least important of the three arcs
  while this film is better overall than  say  martin scorsese s first film  a decade later  who s that knocking at my door  another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers  it has none of the brilliant moments  acting wise nor cinematographically  that that film has  it also is not naturalistic  for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve  especially in film  although the  s era manhattan exteriors  at ground level  is a gem to relive  while shadows may  indeed  be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit  it certainly is nowhere near a great film  parts of it are preachy  poorly acted  scenes end willy nilly  almost like blackout sketches  and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle  all in all it s a very sloppy job  especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film  as cassavetes proved that as a director  at least in his first film  he was a good actor  the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films  and this gives a clue as to his later working style   the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as  culturally significant  this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed  as typified by this quote   i ve never seen an exploding helicopter  i ve never seen anybody go and blow somebody s head off  so why should i make films about them  but i have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way  i ve seen people withdraw  i ve seen people hide behind political ideas  behind dope  behind the sexual revolution  behind fascism  behind hypocrisy  and i ve myself done all these things  so i can understand them  what we are saying is so gentle  it s gentleness  we have problems  terrible problems  but our problems are human problems  that this film is  culturally significant  is true  but that truth is not synonymous with its being  artistically significant  it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives
