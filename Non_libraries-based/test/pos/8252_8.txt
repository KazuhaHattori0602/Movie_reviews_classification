i remember seeing this film in the mid  s thought it a well paced and well acted piece  i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed  although my office is newish it just   seconds away from  the bank  even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces   it s look like the dvd is due a region   release soon  the region   copy i is very poor quality  let s hope they ve cleaned it up   only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with
