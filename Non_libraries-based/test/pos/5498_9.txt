quite simply a well made  well written and wonderfully acted movie  eastwood is classic as grizzled secret service agent frank horrigan and rene russo  holds her own as partner  and love interest  lilly raines  but the movie s  greatness rests on the shoulders of john malkovich as  booth  he captures  this character s rage and hatred  as well as his humanity oddly enough    personally i think this was his best performance and should have received an  oscar for it  but i loved tommy lee jones in the fugitive as well that year  overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin s mind and be  on the edge of your seat the whole way through  enjoy
