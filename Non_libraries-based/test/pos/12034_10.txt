this movie have   parts and every is around   minutes long  its based on true story of life of joe bonanno and it is telling all how he did see  so in some events we can notice that we heard different about it  movie make you tied up for chair till the end  i think it is possible to watch all   in a row  and not notice i watched   in a row and   next day in a row  acting in movie is ok in some scenes awesome but in general could be bather  but this movie is not about acting or special effects and glamor  this one show real thing and story is key to this movie  so the one who look for same spectacular rambo matrix titanic movie you can skip this one  good thing in movie is that follow the main story so you will not have long and boring love scenes or any different interrupt with something not important to crime business of bonanno
