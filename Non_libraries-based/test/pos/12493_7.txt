quai des orfevres takes too long getting going  with clouzot so enamored of his back stage milieu that he is almost in danger of forgetting the story  however  once it does  it s clouzot at his best  bertrand blier  father of bertrand blier and co star of his buffet froid  is the worldworn pianist who married beneath himself and who plans to kill the seedy studio mogul with designs on his wife only to find that someone has beaten him to it  not only that  but his carefully planned but clumsily executed alibi falls to pieces  not least when a thief steals his car at the murder scene
  the film really kicks into life with the arrival of luis jouvet s police inspector  a rather wonderful creation half alistair sim in green for danger and half world weary maigret with better dialog  in a neat running gag  his investigation is constantly conducted at the top of his voice against chaos and noise  whether it be the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal  the police station itself is a wonderfully realistic creation  a wealth of chaotic and telling small details that makes steve bocchco s once revolutionary  s us cop shows look like antiquated museum pieces by comparison    if suzy delair is a rather unconvincing femme fatale  the supporting cast more than compensate  with the beautiful simone renant a standout as the lesbian photographer in love with her from afar and constantly mistaken for blier s lover by delair and other interested parties  only jouvet  similarly unlucky with women  understands and genuinely sympathises  with great black and white photography by armand thirard  this is a terrific little thriller with a nice twist ending and a lovely scene with a cab driver reluctantly identifying renant in a police station   trivia note  pierre larquey  who played the playfully philosophical dr vorzet in le corbeau  turns up in smaller roles as a cab driver in both quai and les espions   the criterion dvd is quite superb   great picture quality plus an illuminating extract from a french tv show featuring interviews with clouzot  blier and renant
