this was one of those films i would always come across  be it on tv or cheap dvd  but never struck me to give it a shot as i thought i wasn t missing out on much  it was on one night and i thought oh well
 why not  a good decision too  as i would kick myself for taking so long to get around to it  for me it left me impressed  as it s up there with burt reynold s best features  deliverance   white lightning  and  boogie nights  and streams back to those  s s gritty  hardboiled urban crime thrillers that weren t afraid to be forebodingly obscure and go out of their way to set up characters  pack it with realistically brutal force and effectively incorporate the local locations  atlanta being the case here  to the fold with grounded photography  in certain shades it kind of reminded me of  dirty harry  but that s loosely  however it s saucily honed blues score with its simmering kicks  funky shifts and unhinged sounds  very much had me thinking of lalo schifrin s pulsating score he orchestrated for  dirty harry  the music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss   sgt  tom sharky was an atlantic narcotic agent before a slip out during a bust saw him demoted to vice work  along with his new squad they come across a prostitution ring  which catches their interest due to fact it s owned by one hard to track and to convict crime lord  what they dig up involves a prominent government figure and a call girl which can give them some important names  but they must get to her before she s made a target   burt reynold s acts  but also directs in an unyieldingly firm and muscular fashion which would suit his laconically hard nosed performance and gerald di pego s thematically hard bitten and taut screenplay  that was adapted from william diehl s novel  well he does show some sort of heart insightful thoughts amongst that armor within the scenes involving the fetchingly able british actress rachel ward  be it the stake out scenes when he s watching her from another building  and slowly becoming infatuated by her  to when they finally come together  but these latter interactions mid way through do slow up the momentum but give it noir like strokes  the performances are fairly spot on with reynold s formulating a great rapport with exceptional actors charles durning  earl holliman  brian keith  richard libertini and bernie casey  the scathing profanity and witty dialogues between these guys were a blast  as for the corrupt villains  vittorio gassman builds imposing strength and power  but it s henry silva  who seems born for these roles  icily cunning and unstoppable turn that makes the show  where his appearance seems to outline things to come and help them fall into place  plus his adrenaline filled and violent cat and mouse climax with sharky and his team is brilliantly done   the exciting action passages might be quick and dry  but remain lethally violent like an immensely teeth grinding interrogation sequence  some handy  old fashion filming techniques add to the suspense  the intriguing material keeps it quite tactical being character derived  but when we think its smooth sailing it offers up a blunt surprise or two along with some intensely brunt confrontations
