this is a   disney movie  for the time  i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie  feeling nostalgic  i purchased the three series dvd s of the dexter riley movies and even now  at age   i still enjoyed them  it was all about fantasy  magic  and clean fun  and it still is  i wasn t sure which of the three movies came first then second and last  so now i have the official dates  on december     the computer wore tennis shoes on july     now you see him now you don t on february     the strongest man in the world  i still think the middle movie was the best  the special effects were amazing back in   to us kids  i definitely recommend it to all ages
