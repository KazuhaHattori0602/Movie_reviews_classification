there are moments when you don t want those deep drama series  when you don t want series with heavy stories or a must to watch every single episode to be able to hang on  there are moments when you just want to watch a simple series  with lots of action and cool characters  for those moments  you have cleopatra    i was one of those who actually enjoyed charlie s angels  critics said it was to superficial and silly  but the thing is  that s the point  people who can t relax and expected a serious movie hated it  it s exactly the same with cleopatra   it is superficial  it has silly and unrealistic characters  and that s why i like it  it isn t like any other series   the first season wasn t very good  the character cleo was irritating and a little too much  the story was a little lame  and you didn t get to know the characters very much  but hey  they only had   minutes in every episode   in the last   episodes of cleopatra   they finally gave the series full  minutes length  and it was here i started to love it  the series finally started to grow into a very qualitative series  too bad they had to cancel the series  because the last episodes of cleopatra   actually was very good  i will never forget hel  sarge and cleo  unique characters that only the creators of xena could have created
