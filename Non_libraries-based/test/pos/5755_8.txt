this is a gem of a film  slapstick violence a plenty  simon pegg and green spew   a suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker    if you haven t seen this i can highly recommend it  maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short   if you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film   i didn t even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that ritchie and eddie are both ghosts   feeb     boiled egg
