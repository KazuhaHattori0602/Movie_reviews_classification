i say sadly because if you see this movie now  you realize how low our media has sunk  all the warning signs are in this movie   it s a great film  i think the last great james brooks film  but others may disagree  it has rich characters  who are believable as well  great acting  great writing  and although the music got a little cheesy  i even liked that   william hurt has never been better  holly hunter is stunning  and albert brooks walks away with every scene he s in  this triangle of people is beautifully drawn and compelling and made the whole movie soar above it s vital and important topic of the news  and how it s slowly being compromised in our nation   watch this with network for a truly fun and frightening evening
