since the last horrid ast rix film and the fact that we only get the swiss german version in cinemas  here  i went to watch it with quite a bit of trepidation  unfounded  as i was happy to discover ^____^  the film is funny and modern  has good gags  a good animation  an amusing character interaction  a good voice cast  note  i can only speak for the swiss german one  except for the viking chief s daughter abba  her name is great  despite the not very inspired voice actress   i especially liked the character justforkix  goudurix in french  grautvornix in german  he s the young man who is supposed to be put in shape  he s a very amusing portrayal of a mollycoddled  urban teenager  but he s very likable  despite the teenage mannerisms  xd the interaction between ast rix   ob lix and their young charge is fantastic and thoroughly entertaining   it shouldn t be compared to the old films  since this one is quite different  which surprisingly doesn t make it bad  on the contrary  when they tried to modernize the last film  twelve years ago  they completely blew it  this film  however  proved that it can be done just fine  ^ ^  i came out of the theater cheerful  always a good sign ^_
