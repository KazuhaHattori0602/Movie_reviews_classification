back in the day  i was one of the rn s in the emergency rooms  these skaters would occasionally land in  they were not treated well  and some of it was brought on by their asocial personalities  but we all knew they were a talented bunch of  wonderkids  even then  they deserved better care than they received  i m afraid  they had  attitude  in spades   i m so glad i caught this documentary on ifc tonight  it will be on again at   am and i ll be watching again   little attention was given to them until the rich dying kid was able to talk his parents into draining the pool  and the film really highlights that as the taking off point it was an amazing time  and deserved to be recorded  stacy peralta is due all the praise heaped on him  and long may those z boys enjoy their memories and contribution to the real sport of skateboarding  as for the few  sour grape  reviews contained herein  there always were and there always will be  wannabees  and hangers on who never do more than dream the z boys lived it  breathed it  were it   nice to see the vintage films and even the lone girl   peggy  who was so talked about as being the only female to win their respect   thanks to ifc i get to really take the occasional drug free head trip of my youth and relive the heart pounding excitement again
