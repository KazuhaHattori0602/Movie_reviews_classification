i first heard about commander s log when i was on the concom for the local science fiction convention  craig bowlsby  linden banks  sophie banks  and brian oberquell came out to show the video and give a couple of panels on making tv on a shoestring budget  i have to say that i was very pleased when i finally had the chance to see the show  comparisons with red dwarf are inevitable  since the first seasons of red dwarf were also shot on a low budget  although commander s log has to set some kind of record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time  and thus have to make up for the lack of  eye candy  with good writing and acting  linden banks  who plays chief petty officer blather  does a particularly good job of presenting an earnest but clueless persona   bowlsby s original idea was for the story to be told in two minute  interstitials  shown in between other shows over the course of an evening  although for some reason  space didn t get how cool an idea this would have been  and so the interstitials were all rolled up into a one hour show  which space normally showed in two half hour episodes  the existing dvd doesn t include episode    which premiered at cascadia con in seattle in   or episode    which was previewed at vcon in vancouver in   but if you re in touch with your local fannish community  you may catch news of a showing somewhere near you
