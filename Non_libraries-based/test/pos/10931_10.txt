i have just read what i believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical irishman  lovely to read   however  a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice   envy  greed  pride  sloth  anger  etc  and justice in the forms of retributive  distributive  blind  and divine   i could demonstrate three examples of each  one for each of the three protagonists  however  it is much more fun to note them for oneself   this is an excellent film   don t miss it
