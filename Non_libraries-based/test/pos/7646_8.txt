i like armand assante   my cable company s summary sounded interesting  so i watched it  twice already  and probably will again   the early part is difficult to follow  but later it clears up  i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends   some of the acting is unconvincing  but maybe that s because i was always expecting some kind of double cross  in that case  the poor acting would be the insincerity of the characters interacting with each other  so it fits very well   the important theme is the carnival owner  assante  is laundering money for a local casino   his snake charmer wife  dagmara dominczyk  wants to steal it  she complains to  archie   reedus  how terrible her life is  and how he could help her get out of it   there are   or   plot twists  which is probably the reason for all of those loose ends  and just when you think you have solved the mystery  something else will happen   my   score is mostly for the plot   i won t say any more   i don t like spoilers  so i don t want to be one  but i believe this film is worth your time
