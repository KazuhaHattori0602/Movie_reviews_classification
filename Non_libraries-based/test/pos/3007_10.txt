i just started watching the show around july  i found it by mistake  i was channel surfing during a vacation  it is a great show  i just wish it wasn t on so late at night  it s on at   am  as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time   i read some comments  i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the  s and not believing that this stuff can happen   i grew up in the  s  i m hispanic and i had a  white  boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school  i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color   i can t wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it  this way i can see it from the beginning
