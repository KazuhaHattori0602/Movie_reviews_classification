having seen  and loved this film in australia  i was very keen to get me paws on a copy  i got one on dvd back in the uk only to find that it s a very different edit   the domestic australain edit i saw is snappier  the uk  and i presume european  edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by jimmy s dead brother and in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit   it is not a serious criticism  but the oz edit is just brisker and i think more assured   i can t say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market   so careful about which one you go for   i went for both
