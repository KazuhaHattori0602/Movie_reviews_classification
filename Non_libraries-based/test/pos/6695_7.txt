i got this as a complete set of   episodes on   dvds  i knew nothing about the history of the series  season   of the series has the pilot episode as episode   and then   more episodes for a total of   season   lists   episodes with the last being beyond good and evil with an original air date of   december   the other   episodes on season   were broadcast from december   to febrausry   so beyond good and evil looks like season   episode   except there are no more episodes in season    spoilers here  the two main characters of the first   episodes  dr  iain mccallum  john hannah  and dr  angela moloney  zara turner  are missing from this episode being replaced by dr  dan gallagher  nathaniel parker  and dr  charley fielding  eva pope  i recognized nathaniel parker from the series the inspector lynley mysteries  which began in   so they were planning to have a season   but only one episode was broadcast   it seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character  mccallum  when the main character is gone from the series  so they might have been planning a return of dr  iain mccallum  but when that failed the series was canceled  i have no inside information on this but i do see that both john hannah and nathaniel parker were involved in other projects in   does anyone have any information on this
