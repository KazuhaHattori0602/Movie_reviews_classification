my sister  a friend and i went to see this film for my birthday on the  th of september  we had all seen the first  jackass  movie a while back  and we all enjoyed it  we were really looking forward to number two   we were not disappointed   from start to finish i was laughing hysterically  it is equal parts shocking and amusing  however  and is definitely not for those with weak stomaches  it is obscene  but it is also groundbreaking american cinema  well  perhaps that s a bit too much praise for a movie where men intentionally get their scrotum s stuck to ice sculptures  but it is groundbreaking in that it shows us obscenities whether we like it or not  things that no other  decent  american movie released nation wide would dare show us   there was only one scene in particular that i felt was unnecessarily obscene  and it involved a horse   i ll not elaborate   i laughed  i nearly gagged  and i came damn close to crying  out of a physical reaction to viewing a scene involving a leech and an eyeball  not sadness  in my humble opinion   jackass  number two  is the film of    does that make me a jackass  perhaps  but if it does  i could really care less
