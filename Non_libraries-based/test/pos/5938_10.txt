if you enjoyed the tv series  diagnosis murder  you ll love murder   it s great to see dick van dyke in a murder mystery again  if we re lucky  this one will be a start of a tv series or at least series of movies   this movie definitely had some great and notable actors filling the roles  but  it didn t feel like a  face  movie  it was really a story that drew you in making you forget about the fame of those on the screen   i made a guess as to the ending and was so pleasantly surprised at the end that i had to watch it again  this is a must see for any mystery buff or dick van dyke lover
