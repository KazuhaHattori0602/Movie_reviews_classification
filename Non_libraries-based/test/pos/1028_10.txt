  great news there is a bbc dvd release scheduled for  st july  uk   there is also a scheduled release in states   don t know the date   can t wait         below is my original comment   i agree with all the other reviewers   it is simply staggering that one of the greatest tv dramas ever has never been released on dvd  the story line is gripping   the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling    over here in the uk we have quite a history of getting tv drama series and films out onto dvd through popular campaigns   it s very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a dvd production   i m going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens  who did the production   was it bbc   rw
