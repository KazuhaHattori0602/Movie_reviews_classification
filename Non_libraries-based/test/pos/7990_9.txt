as a kid i grew up with the chintzy  s tv series  and no i m not that old
 pow  however when director tim burton brought his novel vision to the silver screen  i simply took an immediate shine to it and never backed away from favoring his installments over the much hyped latest additions  batman begins  and  the dark knight  which i don t really care for  even if they re going for a much more grounded approach and wanting to explore bruce wayne batman psyche further
 but in honesty i don t think there s all that much to tap in to  i wanted crazy fun with a dark streak and in my eyes that s what burton brought across  and this is the reason why i can watch them over and over again    after wowing audiences with the    batman  thanks to the gaudily gothic art direction and jack nicholson take no prisoners performance of the camped up  but psychotic joker  burton would return   years later for the follow up and my favorite of the batman films so far   batman returns  camp  but well done  in what would fair up to being even more expansive  louder  dreary  and nihilistic and having two villainous foes for the price of one  enter the grotesque penguin  with danny devito magnificently going out on a limb  and the ravishing catwoman  a steamy michelle pfeiffer who fills out the suit nicely  coming to spoil gotham s party  again batman  an aptly brooding michael keaton is equally commendable and looks quite imposing in that bat suit
 look at the eyes  plays second fiddle to the bad guys  but i always preferred this sober interpretation of batman that gave him an ominously gloomy mystique  but also a wearing psychological complexity that never felt the need to force feed  and his turn of bruce wayne was well served too  burton s illustratively atmospheric direction opens with his sleek gothic style engraving an carnival comic book world filtered in with a splendid range of characters and vivid costumes  the moody narrative  in what probably is a tad too long  is more so symbolic in its progression  rather show piecing its spontaneously arresting and extravagant set pieces and sharply etched art direction covered with shadowy tinges and grey blue neon lighting of a wintry backdrop  the magnetically free flowing camera work takes flight and danny elfman s stately spacious score balances the playfulness along with gloomy touches with a very hypnotic pull  the rest of the performances might be overshadowed  but christopher walken digs in his teeth into a smarmily glassy role of a two faced businessman max shreck  pat hingle is back  but gets very little to do as commissioner james gordon and michael gough is delightful as alfred  in solid support are michael murphy  andrew bryniarski  vincent schiavelli  doug jones and peter rubens also makes a cameo appearance
