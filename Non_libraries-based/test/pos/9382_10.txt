watching  death bed  the bed that eats  is like waking up in the hospital  two days into a suicide  watch  disorienting but oddly stimulating  there are few cinematic equivalents to this disturbing yet often humorous lesson in mythology  morality and surrealist ideology   cocteau s  blood of a poet  and maya deren s  experimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in death bed  a close comparison are the dark adult fairy tales by literary genius  author angela carter  the short disturbing stories of unica  zurn or e t a  hoffman    death bed has many recognizable elements of the  past  but displays a wholly unique and original storyline   as a story  death bed is an amazingly simple yet original  vision  something which only one in a thousand independent releases will manage to accomplish  this unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful non actors  and lost creepy locations  a true  s independent classic    death bed also displays a unique  subversive   dimensional personality  a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a  fun house  type of construct  the passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues  the bed with its sinister black humor  the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery  most pleasing is the image of aubrey beardsly  the suffering artist  forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim  offerings  gifted to him as love offerings by the demented bed s spirit    a sick refrain and wonderful element  metaphor for the  trapped artist    nothing but the weirdest in poe or mallarme can equal that    anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multi layered symbolist experience  or craves the surrealist concept of  convulsive  beauty  and the gothic horror leanings of low budget exploitation film making will dig this totally unique vision  a simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents  highly recommended
