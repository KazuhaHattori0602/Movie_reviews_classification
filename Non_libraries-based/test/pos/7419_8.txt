this movie has one of the best club scenes  very good soundtrack  if you like techno trance music   some situations  as the main character carl begins to take drugs for example  are a little off reality  but the plot is entertaining  but the characters are all a little shallow   i d not recommend you to see this film if you don t like techno music  for the plot acting alone this movie is a   with the really cool special effects and the club scenes and soundtrack it s a   but if you would want to go to the movies just to hear nice tracks and grab a little club feeling  it s a    the special effects are sometimes hidden  sometimes clearly visible   i e  fast moving clouds sun moon  morphing background  morphing cuts   i for one enjoyed it very much  a shame there was no dancefloor in the cinema
