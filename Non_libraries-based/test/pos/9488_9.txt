the only footage of zeppelin i ve seen prior to this dvd is  the song remains the same  movie from   we used to spend hours round a friends house watching this  but i never really liked it and hated the fantasy sequences   so what of this dvd  i didn t know it existed until browsing for the physical graffiti cd when did this come out  i thought  for some reason i thought that page wasn t a great live guitarist  but to say that watching this dvd has changed my opinion is a massive understatement    there s  white summer  from       minutes of guitar wizardry   there s an acoustic set from      bron y aur stomp  has a brilliant finger picking improv section   the  in my time of dying  and  trampled underfoot  performances  also from   are breathtaking   with page and bonham tearing things to pieces like no one else ever has  demonic possessions of rawk   the magic continues into the knebworth   section  the rendition of  achillies last stand  considering their various drug addled states just beggars belief  a song of complex guitar overdubs  page arranged it in a way that lets him just  punk it out  live   the effect is totally mesmerising   in the evening    i never liked this on disc but it zings along here   sick again    great piece of sleaze rock  the footage from knebworth is very interesting  cutting between big screen  various rostrums and bootleg footage to great effect   plant is amazing throughout all the performances  page  despite being painfully thin  looks like a six year old kid having the most fun of his life at the knebworth concert   and makes infectious viewing   one thing that puzzled me   the  black dog  performance from   sounds very  camped up  robert plant always did love a little  mince  and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous   and would warrant an arrest nowadays  all very different from the muscle bound kick a  studio version   i love this dvd  it has reminded me how good zeppelin were and remain
