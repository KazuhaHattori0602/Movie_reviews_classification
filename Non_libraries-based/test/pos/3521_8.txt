ignore the bad reviews on here  this film is awesome   just before dawn  is a great example of what can be done in a film with a minimal budget if you have a dedicated crew  decent script  and a cool idea for a film  it s a hell of a lot of fun   i enjoyed it a lot more than most other  s slashers because the killer is so unique   wrong turn  ripped this movie off something fierce  there s plenty of blood and scares  my girlfriend was freaked out and she watches almost everything with me and doesn t flinch  it s got that creepiness to it   i d say that  just before dawn  is the best early  s slasher out there  i really enjoyed it     out of   kids
