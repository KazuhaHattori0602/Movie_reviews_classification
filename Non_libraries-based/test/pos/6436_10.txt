i remember watching this film in   when i was   it was absolutely brilliant  i found the dvd just a couple of months ago  i was nearly jumping up and down with glee  i bought it and showed it to my kids  they loved it too  they asked what words the seahorse was singing  i didn t tell them  though  because i don t think telling the words  gay  and  ecstasy  to   year old kids is very good parenting  the songs are brilliant  i still remember them all  i ll still remember them when i m   there  or near abouts  tommy pender is  was  such a brilliant actor  it s a pity he gave it up   if you find the film  buy it  you ll love it
