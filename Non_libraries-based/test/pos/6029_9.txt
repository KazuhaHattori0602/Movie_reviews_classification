this movie is a little slow in the the beginning  for about the first   minutes or so  but once it kicks in you can t turn it off  adam beach and rose mcgowan play the best parts and are great at their acting job  you would never be able to guess who the killer is  i gave this movie a   because at some parts adam beach needs to speak up a little so you can hear what he s saying
