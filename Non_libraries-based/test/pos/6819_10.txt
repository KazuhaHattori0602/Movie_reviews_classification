i watched this short moments ago on the sundance film festival website  and i must say it is absolutely astounding  i expected it to be entertaining   like all of the sundance shorts   but i wasn t prepared for such deep sadness and yet also a sense of passion and beauty    if you haven t yet seen any of this years entries to the festival  i suggest you go onto the site and watch these mini masterpieces   i have seen them all  and can honestly say  the youth in us  is the one that has touched my heart the most  i m not the weakest audience member when it comes to romance in films  but my eyes flooded up so much i m surprised i could still see the screen   i agree with  addicted you  it truly is a masterful piece of directorial work  and the cinematography will just take your breath away    i can t think of a better way to spend a spare   minutes
