i had the pleasure to view this film when i was   years old having an existing interest in egyptology  i know that there are subtle mistakes to the art direction and costuming  but over all this is the best film  to date with the look of the  th dynasty   the film only approximates mika walteri s  the egyptian  in plot  a good portion of the text never made it to film  as we have to consider the running length   the music score by b  hermann and alfred newman is beautiful  performances as follows  the late edmond purdom gave an excellent performance as an orphaned child adopted by parents past their child bearing years  he states that he keeps to himself has the best education available and lets  face it is a rather emotionally distant person  given his upbringing and high intellect   jean simmons is fine as a humble tavern maid  honest loving and sincere  bella darvi  people complained about her accent  well she is a babylonian  it is not that apparent in the film as to why sinhue is so insanely obsessed with nefer nefer nefer  her correct name  in the book sinhue is enjoying her carnal fruits and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving nefer nefer nefer s drugged body with the  house of the dead s   workers   gene tierney as baketaten  is brilliant  when she tells sinhue that he is pharoah  she looks like she could devour him  in his weakness  she is intense  brilliant and coldly beautiful   michael wilding is heartbreakingly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one god  i believe that we are viewing ankhnaten thru the lens of egyptologist a  weigall  a view at the time that had a pre messiah feeling about ankhnaten s vocation  did his monotheism influence the jewish people  note psalm   and other egyption imagery in the psalms   mr  peter ustinov provided the alter ego to sinhue  he is street wise and cunning a survivor  excellent acting as always   mature never thought much of his acting personally  his horemheb is fine as an ambitious  super patriot  who ultimately has sinhue murder more than one person in his quest for power   walteri s book   i felt that the ending to the egyptian was confusing as sinhue s personality changes too easily  he has a living son  toth dies in the novel  power is handed to him through is half sister baketaten  he world savvy now and has a grip on international affairs  so he became enlightened  he could have modified the amon priesthood as he was capable   but no  sinhue gives everything up  everything including his son s future to become a ragged beggar preaching monotheistic love   this change was too immediate and the major flaw in the script   again the look of the film colour  most of the costumes nefer nefer nefer s gold dress was too over the top as she is more richly dressed than the royal family  music is beautiful   i will watch this film again easily   p s  i know that you porbably know that horemheb did not directly succceed ankhnaten  but i could not resist stating this fact
