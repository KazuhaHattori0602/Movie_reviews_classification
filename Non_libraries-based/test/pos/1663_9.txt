it s a mystery to me as to why i haven t caught up to this masterful  s caper film   turned brooding noir until now  but i m certainly glad to report that it didn t disappoint  i haven t seen any of jules dassin s american films for several years but based on this i ll probably be going back and re watching  brute force  and  night and the city  quite soon   jean servais  a name unknown to me but a face rather familiar in its world weariness and coldness  has recently completed a lengthy stay in prison and as is the way in these films  hey  there wouldn t be a story otherwise  isn t coping well with the straight life  an opportunity presents itself  an easy multi million dollar jewel heist that can be done at night with no fear of discovery by a few men  the taut filming of the robbery  half an hour of total silence  is what people most remember about the film of course  and indeed it s pretty remarkable  but i liked the half completed location of the final shootout  once the robbery has gone sour thanks to the big mouth of one of the thieves  the excellent portrayal gritty sides of paris in stark black and white  and servais  channeling of both eddie constantine and humphrey bogart in his spare but brutal performance   perhaps it s a bit too sentimental in the end  but this is one of those classics that really does live up to its reputation just as pure entertainment even if what it has to say about the human condition isn t exactly deep or thought provoking  george auric s at turns modernist  romantic  and jazzy score is another highlight
