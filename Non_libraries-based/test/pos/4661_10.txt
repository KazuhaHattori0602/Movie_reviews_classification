they don t make movies like this anymore   though some may say that s a good thing  although this was amongst the first of disney s pg rated films  it has more of the feel of the g films their studio turned out in the s  i e   freaky friday   the world s greatest athlete  than the pg films that came out in the early  s  i e   watcher in the woods   tron   something wicked this way comes  because of disney s backing   midnight madness  obviously had a large budget  a huge cast and a ton of diverse locations go to show that  but zaniness  a madcap scavenger hunt  and spectacular visual style weren t enough to save the film from being an enormous flop  a failure at the box office  most of us were introduced to the film on hbo in the early  s  back in the days when the same films would be shown   times a week  oh  wait   they still do that  essentially hbo did for this film what cbs did for  the wizard of oz    they created an enormous cult audience for a sugary sweet mega flop   the biggest problem that makes this a  bad  film is that there s too many characters and very few of them are fleshed out   eddie deezen s  squad  don t even have names  the blue team  although they re the villains  are the most endearing and have the most work put into their characters  with the exception of the girl  who can t act   doesn t have enough to do  harold  perfectly played to the hilt by stephen furst  is really the only one whose character is fully realized in the film  the other standout character is goof off melio  played with tons of charm by now director andy tennant  although then dr  pepper spokesman david naughton was supposed to be the star  his character often comes off obnoxious  particularly when pitted against his brother adam  michael j  fox  while everyone has favorite characters  i don t think anyone who loves the movie could disagree that furst and fox are the only two characters that you really learn anything about   despite the film s many flaws and bad actors  most of whom fell off the face of the earth after this movie  it still works because the actors appeared to be having fun   and fun on the set equals fun on the screen  come on  what college jock doesn t dream of floating around in a beer vat and what zoftig girl doesn t dream of stealing the show at the local discotech  er  i guess it would be at a rave nowadays  campy  squeaky clean fun for anyone who was young in the  s    s  it s only fitting that this has finally gotten the massive video release that it deserves  but where the hell s the widescreen dvd release with the commentary  trailer and the full version of the song that plays in the disco
