e  elias merhige s existentialist experiment in the enduring is definitely one hell of a boring watch  this is like something alexander de large was forced to watch in  a clockwork orange  but  despite just how unwatchable this film really is  it is a success   if you are reading this and have not already seen the film  then it is too late  for me  at least  the payoff  after   separate viewings with lots of break in between mind you  was seeing the list of characters  after  the story was told  that s when the simple message hit home  but i wonder if merhige could have told a   minutes story in about   instead of    however  seeing as how the cast of credits is displayed prominently on the front page for this movie  the cat is already out of the bag and you surely will only appreciate this film if you appreciate existentialist film making from the early  th century  even then  you might puke      but i commend merhige for crafted a piece of art  even if it is unwatchable
