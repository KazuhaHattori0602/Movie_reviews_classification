i am an addict of the tv show  the live shows and everything they do  and this was the last piece of work they have done on tv film as  the league of gentlemen   if you love the series then you will absolutely love the film  it is a nice ending to their tv series    it is clever and funny   although it does not focus on some of the most popular characters  it is still great to see all the characters together and with the writers  a must see for any league of gentlemen fan   watch it
