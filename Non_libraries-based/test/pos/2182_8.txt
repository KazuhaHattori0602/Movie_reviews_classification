i saw this last night on turner classic movies  tcm  i had never heard of it before  and was quite surprised to find it so engrossing   bogart does a star turn as a city wise cynical editor who reluctantly goes along with his greedy radio network boss in this incisive  b  programmer  about   years before he played similar city wise cynics to perfection in movies like deadline usa  knock on any door  the barefoot contessa  and the harder they fall  bogie already had the star qualities down pat   in order to boost ratings  and bring their somewhat high brow programming to a more popular level  wubc   the voice of america  pushes a tell all radio mini series about a woman who was acquitted   years ago by a plea of self defense of killing her husband  not willing to be discreet in order to save the woman s and her husband s reputations  the station uses underhanded methods to reveal all to all listeners  and as luridly as possible   as a time capsule  i also found it very illuminating of male female mores in the workplace in the mid s  although beyond henry o neill  i m unfamiliar with the supporting cast  the players were uniformly excellent  and the direction was taut   if you like this kind of movie at all  e g  a face in the crowd  an inspector calls  etc  don t miss the opportunity to see this one
