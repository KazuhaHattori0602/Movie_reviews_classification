bravestarr was released in   by the now defunct american animation company  filmation on the back of he man  masters of the universe and she ra  princess of power  in   and   respectively  the plot of the cartoon was about a native american cowboy named marshall bravestarr  who possesses the strength of the bear  ears of the wolf  speed of the puma and eyes of a hawk  and his trusty sidekick  a talking horse named thirty  thirty  who carried with him a gun aptly titled   sarah jane  and with the help of deputy fuzz and judge j b serve to protect new texas from the evil tex hex and his band of outlaws   set in futuristic texas  this was and still is to this day  one of the very few cartoons set in a particular city  in the us  hence in the south  thousands of light years ahead in the future  considering this was made in the  s  the creators did an impressive job trying to recreate the wild west look but from a sci fi based outlook  bravestarr didn t just evoke morality and good verses bad  as well as teaching children lessons about life  but it also highlighted themes of culture and community and that we shouldn t take things and life for granted  and despite the fact that this was an action adventure cartoon  many of the story lines  themes and issues it addressed resonate with children and adults in a way that makes sense to them  in addition  marshall bravestarr was one of the very first major cartoon characters from a  ethnic minority background  to make an impact on tv   the sound effects were amazing  the music was great  the theme song equally memorable and the animation was wonderful  the characters were well designed and the stories were diverse and taught kids morals and the importance of what is right and what is wrong  something of which the same cannot be said about today s cartoons  sadly   whilst bravestarr was overshadowed by the success of he man  it is still a personal favourite for many  s cartoon fanatics  suffice to say  i preferred bravestarr over he man because of the diversity of the story lines  characters and that the depth of the situations and problems that the characters faced themselves  were more what i would say realistic and identifiable in contrast  for some reason  they resonated more with people because like for instance in  the pledge  where a kid dies from a drug overdose  the fact that there wasn t a happy ending was important  in the sense that when kids watch that episode  well  in fact anyone who watches that episode  will realise for themselves the devastating consequences of drug usage and that no one should underestimate the dangers of drugs   bold  brave and at times thought provoking  bravestarr is definitely that  bold  brave and thought provoking  a cult cartoon classic for many years to come  it dared to take some risks  but it had well and truly paid off in the end  it will be remembered by many cartoon fans as one of the most interesting as well as best  s cartoons ever  and rightly so    and a half out of ten
