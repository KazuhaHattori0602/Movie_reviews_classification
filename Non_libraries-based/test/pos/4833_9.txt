this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe  while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in   seen now post   it is almost unbearable   it would be a mistake to call this film prophetic  but it certainly makes the common playground wisdom of  fool me once shame on you  fool me twice shame on me  come alive   our government learned nothing from the   attempt on the world trade center and subsequent readings of the   report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in   were repeated   some people have criticized the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution as being partly responsible for the islamic terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans  but that is wrong headed in every possible way   surely the people making this argument are not supporting a ban on free speech  a free press or freedom of religion  i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person s home or office to search without cause or without a warrant   the fact is  the fbi  the ins and even the local police could have gotten warrants based on the information they had in their possession  but they chose not to for a variety of reasons  besides  no matter how distasteful or ignorant it is  it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders  likewise  it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward mecca   consider this  until lee harvey oswald actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy  he wasn t really breaking any laws  living in a free society has its drawbacks   still  path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people  as far as i know  it is not on dvd and   is its tenth anniversary and there are no known revivals of it   i m not really surprised  people don t like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various agencies that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the pettiest of reasons  like jurisdictional squabbles and a refusal to share information   this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before  the final scene where ramzi yousef  played by art malik  the bomber who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and extradition simply says  next time we will bring them both down  is a film moment that froze me in place for several minutes
