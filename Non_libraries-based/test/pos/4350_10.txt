little dieter needs to fly is another in the remarkable body of werner herzog s filmic work that is without peer  having recently rewatched it on dvd  nearly a decade after its initial us release in   it has lost none of its power  and one can see its influence on documentaries as diverse as herzog s own recent grizzly man and errol morris s academy award winning the fog of war  like the former  it details  in its far too brief   minutes  the life of an interesting american  like the latter it gives a peek at a side of war that few see  yes  we see the violence and the heroism  but as the fog of war brought us into the mind of one of last century s foremost warmongers  this film allows us a peek at the life of a grunt who is captured by the enemy  tortured  and ultimately triumphs  except  in no way  shape  nor form  is the film as simplistic nor upbeat as my brief description of it  nor is little dieter needs to fly s titular subject  dieter dengler  and immigrant german who survived the depredations of the nazis  we find out  as example  that in his hometown  wildburg  in the black forest  his grandfather was the only man not to vote for hitler  and suffered brutally for that stand  post world war two germany  and his own imprisonment at the hands of the vietcong  when his air force jet was shot down over laos on february  st   
  while the title of the film  and the idea of dengler s passion for becoming a pilot  stirred by the impression allied fighter planes made on him when they razed his town  as a child  make one believe that dengler is the central subject of the film  this is not true  the subject is dengler s survival  or  more precisely  his human will  all human will  the details of dengler s romantic life are too hollywood and staid an aspect to interest herzog  nor is the fact that he won a purple heart  medal of honor  the d f c  and the navy cross  that thing which pushed dengler to survive so much  and remain such a relatively upbeat man  although there are glimpses of darker sides  is what is at the center of this film  and all of herzog s canon  dieter dengler s  distant barbaric dream  of his past is fully ripened herzog country  and the use of a madagascan chant  oay lahy e  during many jungle scenes  among other excellent touches in the score  show herzog is  perhaps along with only martin scorsese  the best manipulator of image and music in film  long may he merge
