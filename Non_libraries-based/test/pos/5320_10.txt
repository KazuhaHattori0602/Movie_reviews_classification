leland follows the story of leland p  fitzgerald  ryan gosling  a disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded peer  the brother of a girl he was dating  the issue is not whether he did it or not   leland admits to it  straight away   but rather  why  interestingly  rather than a crime drama  leland becomes a character story  examining why people do what they do   not necessarily the easiest ground to till   and leland features the required indie group of screwed up people  aside from the title character  there s also pearl  don cheadle  who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different  we meet leland s distant and egotistical father  kevin spacey in an extended cameo  who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did  but the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the pollards  the family of the retarded child  first  there s leland s girlfriend becky  jena malone  a drug addict who can t keep herself clean  her sister julie  michelle williams  perhaps the most normal person in the film  who merely seeks to get away from it all  and allen harris  chris klein  a young man who lives with the pollards and is julie s boyfriend  lastly  there s ryan  michael welch  whom all the others call goofball  who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings   leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist  but the movie slowly   occasionally too slowly   burrows into everyone s lives  asking the chief question  why do people do what they do  while leland discusses it openly in a journal pearl allows him to keep  examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility  all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another s  perhaps the most basic choice any human can make  and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices  and the consequences of them   in the beginning of the film  you re simply struck by the depth of the cast  spacey  cheadle  gosling  michelle williams  even chris klein   these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in  and putting them all together makes for a heady brew  for a space in the middle the film seems to stall  sputtering along as it unfolds  it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers  but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together  leland becomes a quietly powerful piece of film making  leland s explanation of the world and his actions  in the end  bring every story into focus  and all the investment you ve made in the film pays off   saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice  at this point in his career it s redundant   this is one of the finest young actors working today  and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought provoking protagonist  gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting  he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle  whom we know has the goods  and he not only holds his own  he elevates cheadle s game as well  cheadle himself is in top notch form  imbuing pearl with a fully rounded humanity   for good and bad  spacey is kind of one note  but that s the character  and he handles it excellently  i was surprised by chris klein  with this level of acting  i thought he would be buried in the mix  but he gives probably the turn of his career so far  terrific work all around   leland is a bit of a downer  and again  it s draggy in spots  but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer  on this one  anyway  there s also a subtle commentary on racism in the film  in leland s first day in juvenile hall class  he s the only white person in the room  that  like much of the movie  is very effectively handled  i wouldn t go so far as to call this required viewing   some might find it too slow or too odd   but i thought it was one of the better films i ve seen in a while  far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there  i d recommend it   with the above caveats   if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft
