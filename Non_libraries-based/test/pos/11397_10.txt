boogie nights is one of the best films to come out of the  s and i d go so far as to say it should be in the imdb top   i can actually understand why many would dislike it  due to the subject matter  i personally feel however as many do  judging from the aclaim this film s received by viewers and critics that it s topnotch film making   the direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance there is not one scene in this movie that isn t amazing  the individual characters reach out and touch you  given that this is a movie about the porn industry  one wouldn t imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are  the direction is among the best i ve ever seen and i ve seen a lot of films   the film isn t about one particular personal individual s story  it s about many it s a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them  boogie nights draws you into their story from the beginning  and though the film is long i believe almost   hours  you honestly don t even notice  and when it ends you kind of don t want it to   i m not easy to impress  meaning there aren t many movies i d give a   of   rating to but this is one  beyond the multiple character study  is the use of music in the film  i have never  in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie there was such flawlessness to it  you know it s not something your gonna see everyday   burt reynold s performance was perhaps the best i ve ever seen him do  and mark wahlberg is incredible i m astounded there are still people saying he doesn t act well  i don t know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that but the person who really surprised me was heather grahem rollergirl  who is absolutely fantastic in her role  in particular the one memorable scene with burt reynolds in the limo  towards the end   again  i ll echo other imdb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody  but i still think this was topnotch  of
