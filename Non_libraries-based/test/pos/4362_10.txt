little dieter needs to fly was my first film during the   edition of the g teborg filmfestival  as i was extremely tired that evening  i was hesitant to see it  but the raving overall score of   here at imdb made me go there   it was   minutes of pure life force  experiencing dieter denglers life through his own telling was enchanting   see it  and if possible  see it at a cinema
