it s generally an accepted fact that marcel carn s   movies are masterpieces and it s considered polite to say that the rest are mediocrities this is an unfair opinion at least  two of the latter era are eminently watchable th r se raquin   his best post war work and  les tricheurs   the cheats   there s a strange evolution from the prevert golden hour to  les tricheurs in  les enfants du paradis   quai des brumes  or  le jour se l ve true love is thwarted by the villains  in  les tricheurs  true love does not exist anymore we deal with a bunch of young people who believe in nothing falling in love would be incongruous for this youth the adults are not the villains at all mic s brother and mother are kind people  but she is beyond their command very few grown ups appear anyway   during two hours the characters do not stop playing around dancing listening to jazz records a music which was not still part of the bourgeois culture and heavily drinking  when two of them discover they care for each others  it will be too late   the cast is rather good  laurent terzieff as an existentialist cynic and andr a parisy as a rich kid are the stand outs on the other hand pascale petit and mainly jacques charrier who married brigitte bardot the same year as  les tricheurs do not possess the ambiguity their parts ask for they are all smile too sweet and to nice to be believable   oddly les tricheurs  was labeled  nouvelle vague when you know what the priests of this cinema school  the likes of godard thought of carn   it s really a good joke but this disenchantment you feel throughout the whole movie is really disturbing
