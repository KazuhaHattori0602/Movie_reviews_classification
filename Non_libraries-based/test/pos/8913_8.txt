there is more to this movie than meets the eye  if you re looking for groundbreaking originality or easy comedy  you ll be disappointed  but for an entertaining   minutes  this is just fine   the cinematography is careful and precise  the sex scenes  which one comment decries as gratuitous  are anything but   every gesture contributes to the development of the characters   yes  some of the main characters are not exactly lovable human beings  but the movie makes an honest effort at showing their interactions in an honest light  without being sensationalistic  at least not for early  st century urban standards  and there are many very amusing moments
