 the violent men  marked the finest collaboration of rudolph mat  with glenn ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive justice
   ford is john parrish  a former cavalry captain who is itching to get married and start a new life
 his fianc e caroline vail  may wynn  is desperate to move east  and to see him selling his spread to lee wilkison  edward g  robinson   parrish is not even much of a cattleman
 but he do understand that there is something big building up in the valley
 in the army  they used to call it  enemy pressure  first  cole wilkison  brian keith  comes back from texas to help his brother run anchor
 then a tough kid with a fancy gun  richard jaeckel  shows up on the wilkison payroll
 then all the small ranchers are forced out  getting the same kind of offers
 parrish saw himself either running like they did  or stand and fight
  but can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back  can he easily argues with a man who started with a few acres of land and now owns practically the whole valley    all that grass and sand ever meant to the ex confederate army officer the past three years
 it was a place to regain his health
 out of habit of taking advice  parrish affirms   what happen in this valley is no concern of mine  and much to the disappointment of the remaining ranchers and farmers  who pressure him to stay on  he decides to accept wilkison s offer to fulfill the promise he made to his fianc e
  when lee s younger brother cole made the wrong move  trying to push parrish make up his mind by lynching one of his ranch hands  parrish got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the privilege of being let alone
   brian keith plays the traitorous brother who s behind the killing  he dreams to have position and respect in running one day anchor
   lee s ambitious wife martha  barbara stanwyck  secretly hates herself and her husband
 stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who can t bear the touch of her husband s hands
   edward g  robinson is good enough as the anchor s crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife  unaware that she is having an affair with his younger brother
  dianne foster is too sensitive as the unsociable adult daughter well aware of her mother s burdens
    the violent men  uses the wide screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action drama  making it a perfect example of the genre s most enduring classics
