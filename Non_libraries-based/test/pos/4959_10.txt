okay  here s the deal  there s this american pilot who s flying along  minding his own business  when suddenly he s outnumbered by evil  cowardly non american fighter planes  they re middle eastern types  but suffice to say they don t like apple pie or elvis presley  who proceed to shoot him down  now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong  but those evil non americans didn t care and before you know it he s banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death   now  what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released  but not this time  those evil peace lovin  types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre  as you can imagine  this doesn t please the pilot s family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug  contented look about him  he ll make those americans pay  oh yes indeed   but he didn t reckon on doug masters  the captured pilots  year old son  you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car   which can t be that long  and decides to fly into that evil  foreign country and get his dad back  so with the help of his friends  doug and his wingman  retired pilot  chappy  sinclair  doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners    now you d think that this plan would be bound to fail  but you d be wrong  sure  those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots  but doug s got an ace up his sleeve  he listens to rock music when he flies  after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery  doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane  understandably  the evil  not quite so smug anymore  dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself  in bid to shoot down doug  but the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky  hurrah   after doug and chappy have shot down   of their air force  the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down  but in the nick of time  a flight of us f s turn up and scare them away   i cannot recommend this film enough  it was the first ever videocassette movie that i brought  and until i was twenty  i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him  but he s doesn t like flying  so it didn t happen
