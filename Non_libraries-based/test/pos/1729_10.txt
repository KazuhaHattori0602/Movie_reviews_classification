okay  i grew up on who  but haven t loved a doctor since tom baker  christopher eccleston made me love who again and i ll be furious with him forever for leaving    the writing is grand  the acting superb  the directing  which was dreadful in the old days  is just fantastic  i was very skeptical about this programme  and watched it merely out of being forced  but am now a huge fan and love it  i have a ringtone of a dalek screaming  exterminate  then    a few of the things i love about the new programme     people actually notice when rose  billie piper  disappears off the planet  some of the old shows an assistant would drop off for a while  and then come home like nothing has happened  no one noticed    chris eccleston s doc loves rose   romantic or not will be debated  but there is no doubt that   loves and cares about his companion  he d destroy the world if he had to to save her  which the old show was lacking   often a doctor wouldn t care if he never saw his assistants again    they talk and think like real people   when rose is shown something outlandish or new  such as aliens  she acts like a real person would   gobsmacked  i never liked it when an assistant from the old show  who never saw anything alien  would just fit right in and adapt instantly  i want to see the surprise on rose s face when she sees a plastic dummy come to life  she gives that to me    the few things i don t like about this series   nearly everything happens on earth  london or cardiff  and i was sort of hoping for a more off world sort of show    that eccleston left so quickly  he really made the show brilliant    but i can let those few things go   i far more enjoy the series than i ever expected to  so i don t mind if they have stuff set on earth    just don t take this show seriously   it s fun  it s smart  it s entertaining  but it s not a super serious heavy duty show  it s pure fun  and pure british  and i can t get enough  watch it with an open mind  and just put your brain into neutral and enjoy   ps   don t watch series   or later  series   was brilliant  the first few episodes of series   were good  but don t watch it once it gets to love and monsters  utter rubbish  completely destroys the show
