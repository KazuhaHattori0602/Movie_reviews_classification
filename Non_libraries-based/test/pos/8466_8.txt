there have been several books that have cited this as the earliest gay cinema  i don t really see this as all that gay in the homosexual sense but then seeing two men dancing in what has to be the worlds first movie musical does have its attraction    there have been several earlier comments about this film dismissing any homosexual overtones  as to those that are quick to dismiss this film as just being silly and an experiment done late at night after too many drinks  well i ve heard that story before    this film is of interest as an oddity and if folks want to consider it the first gay film so be it  better this than the depressing   anders als die andern
