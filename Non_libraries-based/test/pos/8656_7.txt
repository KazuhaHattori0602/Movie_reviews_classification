enjoyed  den brysomme mannen     my wife didn t  so i watched it in bits over a few days   reviewers mainly confused   most agree it s allegorical  but not of what   heaven   hell   socialism   capitalism    that most people don t wish to escape  and it s  essentially  forbidden goes with most of those options   so  presumably you re supposed to project your favourite preoccupation prejudice fear onto it    so i d say it s about an a epicurean life  a live desaturated of colour  literally in the film  figuratively in the interpretation
