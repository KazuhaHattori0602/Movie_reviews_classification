i m a fan of independent film  dialogue driven  character study pieces are where it s at for me  some of the other posts are right   wannabes  isn t going to rival  the godfather  for best mob film ever  on the other hand   wannabes  is a well written and well directed picture that has surprisingly good performances from every actor actress  my problem with one of the other reviews     conor dubin stands out as the only irishman in a cast of italians    dubin is a jewish last name  and as such has a dark complexion  not a traditional ruddy one of an irishman  he doesn t stand out at all  rather  delivers a great performance   this didn t win many awards  but it is deserving of a saturday night with a bowl of popcorn  i found it for   bucks at blockbuster and was pleasantly surprised to say the least  highly recommended
