i think this movie was made as good as it could have been  with only   months and a   budget   i m surprised this wasn t worse  if you are not to care about the cg or special effects  this movie is great   okay  the movie is not that well made  i m sure it could have been but  you try to do better in only   months  but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting   don t trust me when i say that this movie is good  cause i also find the   king kong to be good   i must confess that i didn t watch the complete movie either  i might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there
