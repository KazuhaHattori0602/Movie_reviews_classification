i m not here to tell you  armored  is kubrickian  hitchcockian or fellini esquire  nope  referenced directors are more like don siegel  charlie varrick  and walter hill  the warriors  those two helmers didn t fool around with niceties like putting women in their movies  no skirts need apply  they unapologetically made guy movies  guns  lots of guns  men met violent death with a twitch of the jaw  their movies were like a sap to the head  you want a friend  get a dog    armored  is so a guy movie  dueling armored trucks  bloody gunshot wounds  exploding money  if that doesn t get the lizard part of your brain excited  then stay away   at   minutes   armored  is all muscle without an ounce of fat  we meet six security guards who drive armored trucks  three per truck  the six  led by matt dillon  scheme up a fake hijack involving two trucks  their mission one day is to deliver   million from the federal reserve  i think  the idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse  stash the cash  then stage a hijack  sure  the cops will suspect them  but if they stick together they ll get through it   trouble is  one of the six  played by columbus short  is a holdout  at first  but he faces eviction  and he s the guardian for his messed up younger brother  he needs cash bad   matt dillon cajoles  pleads  persuades the holdout  no blood on anyone s hands  a clean getaway  all good  no bad  you ll be rich forever  blue skies smiling at you    right   everything goes to hell  of course  it s one damned thing after another and the stakes keep going up  and it almost all happens claustrophobically inside an abandoned warehouse somewhere in los angeles  in fact  the movie goes out of its way to project a backdrop of industrial urban decay  i happen to like industrial urban decay   kudos to matt dillon  who plays the top bad dog  he goes from charming to disappointed to frustrated to outraged to totally effing insane in the course of the movie  love that guy   also  credit is due to the menacing  throbbing  blistering and totally sinister electronic soundtrack by john murphy  i am guessing he s heard a few tangerine dream records   also  it s surprising that this is a pg  movie  i caught one   one    f bomb in this entire movie about violent tough guy robbers  on some level  i like that  take the kids   the director is nimrod antal  a hungarian who made a fine noir set in the budapest subway system called  kontroll  screenwriter is an out of nowhere guy called james v  simpson   a lot of the people in this movie are just starting out  i am willing to bet the esteem given to this movie will rise as time goes on and these filmmakers advance in their careers
