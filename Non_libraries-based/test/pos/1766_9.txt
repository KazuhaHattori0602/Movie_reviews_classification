i was surprised   once more  my darling  had not generated enough votes  at this writing  for a  user rating  it s a  screwy  comedy i have enjoyed many times over the years  robert montgomery s mission places him in some very improbable situations  and he s just the man for the job  he maintains his trademark  befuddled  look throughout the film and hysterically  too  ann blyth plays his precocious eccentric pursuer  who assumes a relationship that does not exist  her character is kooky enough to warrant the unearned nickname  killer  but remains cute and cuddly   among the glut of  b  movies from the late  s and  s   once more  my darling  is a standout  this one is worth looking for
