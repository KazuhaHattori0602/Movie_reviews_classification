i can remember a college professor commenting as to how disturbing this film was  reflecting the apathy of adolescents  this was before generation  x   in a way  most of us are products of the same consumer culture  these high school kids spend their time drinking  getting high and wondering what to do about the body left on a riverbank   what would they do today  would things be different  some very important questions  there are some excellent scenes with keanu reeves  and the dysfunctional family he lives with  his   year old brother going out to get wasted  the mother has no idea what to do  spends her time drinking with her boyfriend   this film was a bit before its time in that it addresses the problems in lower class american society  these kids had no outlet  what is available for them in this dirt water town    all in all a few interesting social commentaries are presented  and there are no solutions
