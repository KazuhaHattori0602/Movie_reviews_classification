shawn michaels vs  edge  kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men  edge  whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring  and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs  heidenreich  casket match  ok  after a good opening match  now this  what a crappy match  undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble  and  s royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match  but this is way worse then that match   kurt angle vs  big show vs  bradshaw  triple threat wwe championship  it s alright  i feel all three men could of given a better performance  this just really didn t show them at their best   randy orton vs  triple h  world heavyweight championship  triple h gets a clean win  can you believe it  sure he takes out the sledgehammer but doesn t use it  randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion  but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous  i really liked this match  this was the best performance i ve seen from hhh in forever   the royal rumble match  this was highly entertaining and i usually don t score the royal rumble match this high  the winner is again  very predictable  but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i ve seen in a while   overall  this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans
