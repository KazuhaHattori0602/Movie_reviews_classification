it seems that all people didn t like steven seagal  just take a look at his nomination list  there are only razzie awards nominations  with one win  for him  but i think he didn t earn anything of it  i saw good movies with steven seagal  i saw bad movies with steven seagal  and the patriot   is one of his best movies  nearly as good as under siege   or hard to kill   the patriot shows his activities to protect nature  surely  this movie is not a great one  and i must say that there is more violence than i like  and why must seagal s best friend l  q  jones die the death of a victim  the role of dr  mcclaren is one of seagal s best performances  he has  as always  a very good charisma  and in summary  the patriot is good entertainment and with an average rating of only   points the most underrated movie of all time   regards  hans dieter
