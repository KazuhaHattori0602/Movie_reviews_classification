 this film is a beautiful example of what british films are like  i remember i first saw this when i was eight and on my summer holidays  my parents taped it off the tv and i warmed to it instantly   watching it most days instead of the large collection of disney films that i owned   i believe it was one of liz taylor s first movies and a good one  her character is na ve but sweet   her acting is extremely convincing  especially when she portrays her love for horses  it s also a good chance to see angela lansbury in one of her early roles  who co stars as velvet s older sister  who spends most of her time in the film being smitten with a boy in the town  i must say she was a gorgeous lady when she was younger  beautiful blonde hair and a rosy cheeked face  although she doesn t have a major part in the movie  she dose have a number of scenes   so not to disappoint her fans  parents reading this  i must emphasis   if you can get hold of a copy of this please do  if you re children love animals   i strongly suggest you show it to them  they may find a few scenes boring but you see velvet riding the horse on many occasions throughout the film and would most defiantly entertain children  a lovely and nostalgic film  i might just go away now and put it on
