this film isn t supposed to be funny  but it made me laugh   it isn t designed to be sad  but my heart felt heavy through a number of the vignettes   it isn t written as action adventure  but my pulse raced more than once   just like life  this movie doesn t manipulate your emotions and tell you how to feel  it simply is  and you react   if you don t find it funny or sad or moving  i suspect that says more about you than the film   it amazing and refreshing to see a director so wholeheartedly celebrate that we are all human  and embrace that we are all trapped here  doing this  life  thing  over and over for as long as we must   tomorrow is another day
