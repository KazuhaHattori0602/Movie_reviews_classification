before barton jumps all over my remarks  let s all just keep in mind that opinions are like asses  we all have them   i loved sigourney weaver   jeff daniels  i loved the dialogue and thought the acting was sublime  downplayed just perfectly and understated  unlike some others  i did not find this   all predictable   i found sigourney s role refreshingly humorous and realistic  especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer   i found it enjoyable and wasn t anticipating recommending this to all and sundry  this is why there are different flavors of ice cream  something to please everyone
