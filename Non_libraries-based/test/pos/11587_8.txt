the true story of a spanish paraplegic  ram n sampedro  who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized  this film  along with the best picture winner of the same year  million dollar baby  caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death  both advocates for the disabled and  unfortunately for the disability advocates  conservative pro life groups protested both films  and their oscar nominations  the nominations also came during the entire terry schiavo debacle  just to put it all in some historical perspective  the protests  especially from the disability groups  against million dollar baby make some sense   the film clearly depicted  without wavering  the life of a paraplegic as worthless  the film s central character  maggie fitzgerald  becomes a paraplegic  doesn t seem to get any counseling whatsoever  no help whatsoever  and immediately wants to die  the film is  honestly  pretty dumb and uncomplex  the sea inside  based on the true story  is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject  it most likely got railroaded into the same category as million dollar baby without its protesters having even seen it  an incredibly common phenomenon  the film does give time to many different sides of the argument  and it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone  it is guilty of a couple of crimes  though  and i d still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it  first and foremost  there s the protagonist s meeting with a paraplegic bishop  i don t look kindly on the way he s depicted  his orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd  and there s almost a comic sequence where his effeminate  boy toy servants are dragging him  in his chair  up the stairs  he can t even reach the room in which ram n is located  and one of the boy toys is forced to carry the conversation between them  i had to think  gee  maybe if ram n lived in a slightly more wheelchair accessible household  he wouldn t spend his entire life in bed  and might find life more fulfilling  who knows how closely the film depicts the reality  director amen bar  the others  also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more life affirming  like a cross cut sequence where ram n looks thoughtful and his lawyer s baby is born  but besides a few ugly moments  the film is very good  it hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others  however  in the end  our lives do belong to us  shouldn t we have the right to choose  the film s strongest asset is its supporting characters  and the actors who play them  it depicts how ram n s fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision  the family members in particular are great  and ram n s final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking  and had me in tears  my favorite performance in the film comes from lola due as  whom i also felt gave the best  or at least certainly most undervalued  performance in almod var s volver last year
