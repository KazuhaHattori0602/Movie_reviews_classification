i m not a massive disney fan  but my   year old son is starting to get into them  so we ve built up quite a collection  and this is one of my favourites  we first saw this a couple of weeks ago and we must have see it half a dozen times since  ok  as others have pointed out  not the most complex or inventive of plots  but there s more to a film than that   great characters  phil harris stealing the show as thomas o malley  but edgar the butler not far behind  the music is superb   my disabled son always insists that i lift him up and dance with him to  everybody wants to be cat  this says it all  and  thomas o malley  is just as enjoyable   i m not sure why some people have such a downer on this film other than a dislike of cats  and yes  it does take a few of its cues from   dalmations  and maybe  the lady and the tramp   it s been a long time since i ve seen that  so i m not going to compare them  and while   dalmations  is better in some ways  for me  the aristocats  is far more enjoyable  isn t that what these films are about    apart from  peter pan   now that is a   film  this is my favourite disney film  my   year old son loves it  his grumpy   year old dad loves it  so you can t ask much more of a family film   superb
