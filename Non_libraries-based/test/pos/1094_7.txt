one should not be too critical about the director s second feature   i really like the camera work of madiba  as mr  shawn pointed out  he had a unique way of looking at things   however  howcome a   year old boy shoot such beautiful images  remember he has not got any education of any sort  i don t think english is the common tongue in cape town ghettos  worse still  madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of    any way  if you overcome above mentioned peculiarities  you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work
