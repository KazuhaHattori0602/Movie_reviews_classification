i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it  in the  s  there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise  it s one of the best comedies of the  s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary s excellent comedic performance  which still stands as one of his greatest  this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director  reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time  while this film is hilarious and meatballs   is so bad that it s fun  meatballs   and meatballs   are absolutely dreadful  recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters
