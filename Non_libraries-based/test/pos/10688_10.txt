i had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci fi network  it reminded me of the irwin allen tv series of the late  s  time tunnel etc  excellent effects  they beat star trek   done   years later  but then that wasn t very hard to accomplish   i found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production  they would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters  level  but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting  especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro  politics  surprisingly similar to today s european union   the plot is indeed reminiscent of twilight zone in general  as other users have pointed  but in this case it s a compliment   great sets  by the way
