spin offs  for somebody who don t know  are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absent   here they are and you couldn t ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon  not meant to do anything but entertain   j  p  manoux  replacing david spade  does an admirable job of retaining kuzco s ego and yet not seem as annoying as spade s character  a character spade has done for decades and gets on one s nerves after a while  he has a softer voice but it fits somehow   eartha kitt  reprising her part as yzma  is brilliant  she hasn t really been given much accolades since her turn as batwoman centuries ago  except maybe for her vile part in boomerang  it s funny how much the character looks like her  though   and patrick warburton  there is no way that he can t be funny  except when he was thoroughly wasted in men in black   i have been a fan of his since seinfeld but unlike that character  he plays a genuine likable guy who is sucked into doing not so nice things   the animation is really beautiful as all disney usually is but sometimes the character design is a little too sugarcoated  oh  well  two out of three ain t bad
