first off  i never got into dr  who until recently  honestly  i never got the opportunity to watch any of the previous incarnations  pun intended  since it was never  big  here in the us as it is everywhere else   that said  i must say  obviously  that after finishing the  nd season  that this is one of the best sci fi shows i ve ever seen   now  i watch a lot of sci fi shows from all over and this show stands out   the first season was tops to begin with  with christopher eccleston in the title role and i thought he was terrific  of course  so was the lovely billie piper who just adds such humanity and warmth to the character of rose that no one could ve done it better  let s not forget camile coduri as jackie and noel clarke as mickey ricky who are just a blast to watch  then there s david tenannt  at first  i thought he was too gawky looking to play the character  his ears  but after watching the  nd season  he fits in just fine  his sharp acting and physical comedy is almost flawless  he s great with snappy dialog and can turn serious without batting an eye   aside from the great acting from the cast is the acting from most of the guest actors that have appeared  a lot of them are veteran actors but some are new to me and are damn fine   the production and direction of the show is top notch  occasionally  there ll be some cheesy effects here and there  but that s always been a factor in the original series and  like those episodes  is negligible   my favorite thing of all about the series  the stories  writing folks  is always the key to great entertainment  russell t  davies has written many of the episodes along with a few other writers and they have done an excellent job  they ve managed to bring excitement  ingenuity  intelligence and fun with clever concepts and great dialog  i also appreciate the fact that they can breach the older doctors  past story lines and enemies well  my friend explains much of this to me while we watch the show  and respectfully   i won t mention anything about the  nd season and how it ends since the sci fi channel just started airing the  nd season   i wouldn t want to spoil it  it s so much fun and excitement  you ll never want to take your eyes away nor miss a word of dialog   it really is that good   ps  thanks to the producers for nicholas briggs back   exterminate
