shameless screen entertainment is a relatively new and british  i think  dvd label  specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies   mostly italian ones   from the glorious eras when everything was possible  namely from the late  s up until the mid s  the label s selection feels like a crossover between the oeuvres of  mondo macabro  and  no shame   they probably even borrowed the name of the latter  and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like  ratman   my dear killer   killer nun   phantom of death  and  torso   the frightened woman  was completely unknown to me  but since fellow reviewers from around here  whose opinions i hugely value  described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro sexploitation movies of its era  i didn t hesitate to pick it up  this is a very weird film and probably not suitable for about   of the average cinema loving audiences  if you re part of that remaining   however  you re in for a really unique treat  the style  atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco s  succubus  and massimo dallamano s  venus in furs  yet they re both widely considered as classics whereas  the frightened woman  is virtually unknown  it s all a matter of profiling and good marketing  i guess  the story revolves on a literally filthy rich doctor  he lives in a gigantic secluded mansion  owns multiple old timer cars and has a very impressive collection of artsy relics including a life size mannequin doll replica of himself  with a bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women  he considers them a threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping  humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street  dr  sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit  but he slowly falls for her  just he starts to believe in actual love  she strikes back with a vengeance  this really isn t for everyone  but if you can appreciate moody   sinisterly sexy ambiances  bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal  you can consider this one a top recommendation  it s slow  stylishly sleazy and totally bonkers
 shameless entertainment  all right
