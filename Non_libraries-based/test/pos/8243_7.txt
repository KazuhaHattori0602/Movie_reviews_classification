we went to the cinema expecting a biggish budget release and got an art house movie  the movie was projected digitally onto about two thirds of the screen real estate with sloping edges classic of digital projection  and had a limited stereo soundtrack which was wasted on the cinema experience   the content of the film was the same old historical content we have all seen before  but heavily sanitized to prevent the audience being sick  live action scenes what little of them there were  were re used constantly in classic documentary style  which became annoying after a while   i was somewhat amazed that only   people turned up to watch it  guess the rest knew something we didn t   i suspect the producers made the film to recognize the ninetieth anniversary of gallipoli  i have to question whether they should have bothered   seven out of ten for trying  and out of respect for the anzac s
