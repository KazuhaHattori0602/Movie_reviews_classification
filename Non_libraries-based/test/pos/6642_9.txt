i watched this movie on a big screen a few months ago  i didn t know what to expect precisely  and for the first ten minutes i feared i might not enjoy this film  it was beginning very slowly  in silence and almost banality  which was all the less exciting as the sound was quite bad and the subtitles sometimes impossible to read   but i definitely do not regret to have gone on watching it  it is one of the most beautiful bergman movies i ve ever seen  at the same time human  ruthless and psychologically so convincing   seldom have i seen actors play so wonderfully  with such an intensity on their faces   liv ullman s interpretation is unforgettable and sydow is excellent too   there is always psychological violence in bergman movies  and this one may be the most physically violent of them all  the strained relationships between the man and the woman evolve in parallel with the physical violence that is surrounding them   finally  this sober  violent and powerful film contains a surprisingly striking human depth  an excellent bergman
