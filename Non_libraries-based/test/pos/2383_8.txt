scooby doo and the monster of mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern scooby doo animated features  loch ness monster is a considerable improvement   this time the gang head off to scotland to see the highland games and visit blake castle  daphne s ancestral home  and wouldn t you know  the castle happens to be in the  quaint  fishing village of drumnadrochit  on the shores of loch ness   during their stay they meet a few interesting folks  first there is fiona pembrooke  a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the loch ness monster   sir ian locksley  the boss of the national heritage museum of scotland  he is staunch non believer of nessie   the haggarts  the own a cozy inn on the shores of the loch  the sons are a couple of local jokers  always into mischief   del chilman  a wild  paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her   and finally  duncan macgubbin  the dock master who has seen nessie too many times to count   most of these characters are stereotypes  which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression  however if you can immune yourself to it you ll be alright  being from scotland i can t help but wince at the awfully mimicked scottish accents  fact  we don t sound like that   soon enough nessie  looking rather more demonic than  usual  shows up and causes havoc  looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands  the usual chase scenes  clues and shaggy s wacky disguises follow  there are plenty of laughs  the animation is splendid  with some atmospheric scenes and locations  and the plot a lot better than monster of mexico   the only bad thing this time around is the music  i miss louis febre s scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too  where are the hex girls when you need  em   the region   dvd is in crystal clear   anamorphic widescreen  the region   ain t  with dolby   sound  some okay extras are included  definitely worth getting
