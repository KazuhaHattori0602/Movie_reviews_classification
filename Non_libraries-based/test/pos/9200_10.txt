i don t usually comment on films or tv shows but had to post a comment about las vegas   naturally here in the uk we are about  rd s through the  rd season and though i have managed to watch the last series of season     via other means   i m still glued every friday at  pm   from the very first episode of season   i have been a big big fan of this show and own all   seasons on dvd  yes i cannot wait for season   to start in october   so why do i love this show so much  well i have to agree with the last poster  james caan  i know one person cannot make a team but big ed deline was made for caan or maybe it was the other way around  i read that the producers were considering martin sheen for ed deline  do h no way  i also agree that caan s character is getting very soft  i also preferred the tough take no sh t big bad eddy d that we saw in season       he seems to have mellowed out   as i said no one person makes the team by themselves s and of course the other cast members josh duhamel danny  james lesure mike  vanessa marcil sam  nikki cox mary  molly sims delinda all contribute well  even outside cast members such as cheryl ladd as jillian deline  harry groener as gunther  dean caine as casey  mitchell longley as mitch who may feature   or   times during a season can fit in just as well as if they ve been in every single episode from day one   this show has everything  drama  action  suspense  laughs  romance  glitz s  glamour and big time celebrity s who often play themselves s   many may disagree but this is one of the best shows on digital tv and i hope it may long continue after season
