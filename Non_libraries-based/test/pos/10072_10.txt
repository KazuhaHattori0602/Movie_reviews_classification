if you like madonna or not  this movie is hilarious  i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release  however  over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun  sure there are some bad lines   cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast  she is cute funny  and is the only comedic role of her movie career  madonna usually just plays  herself  in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film  she really seems like somebody else for once  of course the film is directed by james foley  who filmed the dramatic and haunting  at close range  with sean penn   christopher walken  and co stars griffin dunn  after hours  who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material  the story is nothing genius and don t expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun  clean   s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see  the soundtrack is also very notable and contains   madonna songs  the   hit  who s that girl  the   hit  causing a commotion  and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads  the look of love top   hit in the uk  and  can t stop  a left over pop ditty from the  true blue  sessions the year before  it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd
