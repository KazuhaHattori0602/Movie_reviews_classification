i ve always liked sean connery  but as james bond i ve always favored roger moore  still it was connery who set the bond standard and while he had by   established himself as something other than james bond  the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as   and save the world from the evil designs of spectre   and what designs they are in never say never again  spectre with the help of a foolish young air force officer who happens to be kim bassinger s brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now spectre headed by blofeld  played here by max von sydow is threatening blackmail of the world   von sydow s operations guy is klaus maria brandauer who is also courting bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side  and he s got a female assassin working for him in barbara carrera who makes angelina jolie as nora croft look like mrs  butterworth   but before sean connery can even get started he s got to deal with a new  m  running things at british intelligence  edward fox thinks connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the british taxpayers too much money with his violent ways  i really did enjoy fox s performance  he s like the great grandson of colonel blimp   i also enjoyed carrera  she s something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods  when she s scuba diving with connery in the bahamas  note how she puts mr  shark on  s case   will connery do james bond again  he was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point  roger moore s father  but i think connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair
