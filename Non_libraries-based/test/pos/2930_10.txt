this is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the season   episodes  with the exception of the imaginationland trilogy  this is the one that made laugh the most  definitely is my favourite so far of season   so basically cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the tourette s syndrome and a new idea comes to cartman  you can imagine  now cartman has tourette s syndrome and is great since kyle once he knows about this is like  he s faking  cartman is certainly on fire  saying whatever he wants to the teachers  to the principal  to anybody  on the other hand we have kyle who now is the intolerant one  basically for saying that cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with tourette s syndrome just to let him see that tourette s syndrome is for real and is great since kyle is like  well maybe someone is faking to have tourette s for fun  in short kyle could not explain that cartman was faking  probably my favourite scene of this episode is when cartman is with kyle s family but right after this scene another kid fins that cartman is simply faking  the kid with tourette s who was at the toy store  cartman basically said to that kid this   isn t having tourette s awesome  but to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for cartman  his master plan  going on national tv to say anything he wants  people will call it brilliant tv  they ll probably give me an emmy  fantastic  in this episode the word  s  is used   times and certainly that s not all  south park won an emmy like a month or so before this episode aired  but here there s a twist  cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall  he says now everything without thinking so we hear from cartman that he wet his bed last night  now is not fun for cartman and he is like  i can t control what i say  and certainly the person who was with him is like  well of course you can t control what you say  you have tourette s  so cartman is like  my tourette s has gotten worse  before i just blurted out cool stuff about jews being lame and stuff but now it s gotten really bad  there is also stuff about chris hansen and to catch a predator  actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts  kyle and thomas were behind that to stop cartman  kyle ends being cartman s saviour  fantastic   tsa voices concern over  south park  october  rd episode   on wednesday  october   the cable network comedy central will air an episode of the animated series  south park  in which one of the young characters  cartman   gets  tourette syndrome  given the nature of this program  we fully expect it to be offensive and insensitive to people with ts and garner numerous calls and emails from our members and the ts community   we have already taken some pre emptive strikes  such as requesting that comedy central air our public service announcement  featuring comedian richard lewis  during or after the show  in addition  once the episode airs and we are able to see exactly how ts is portrayed  we will be able to respond with specific issues and problems we have with the show to the writers    we are actually surprised it took the creators so long to use ts as comedy fodder in this program  since no disability  illness or controversial topic is off limits to them  said judit ungar  president  tsa    we always see portrayals of ts  good and bad  as an opportunity for awareness and education  and a show of this magnitude and popularity is certainly no exception and provides a way for tsa to spread factual information about the disorder  said tracy colletti  flynn  manager of public relations and communications  tsa   we will be posting an official statement on this site with tsa s reaction to the program after the show airs   tsa responds to  south park  episode   unfortunately  as has been the case with far too many media portrayals of people with tourette syndrome  ts  the season opener of south park  le petit tourette    served to perpetuate even further the outright myth that most of those affected by ts have involuntary outbursts of foul language  in point of fact  fully   of people with ts never experience this tragically socially stigmatizing symptom  medically termed coprolalia  for viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder  the misleading take away message couldn t have been clearer   unless you curse  you don t have ts    despite our pre airing trepidations  we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well  researched  the highly exaggerated emphasis on coprolalia notwithstanding  for the attentive viewer  there was a surprising amount of accurate information conveyed  the scripted input from parents  a neurologist  peers and the therapy session with the  ts children s support group  all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public   no doubt this south park episode did generate increased national awareness about ts  nevertheless  we are very concerned that school children with ts will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program  said judit ungar  tsa president   we realize that for over a decade the writers  satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities  the disabled or political figures  the fact that ts was the subject of a popular tv show attests to the fact that the public is so much more aware of the disorder  obviously  this increased awareness we ve worked too hard to accomplish can at times prove to be a double edged sword    tsa contacted the program s executives prior to the airing  and we will be in touch with them again  perhaps we ll succeed in turning this into an opportunity for positive ts awareness
