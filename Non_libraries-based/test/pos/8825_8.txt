watching this ppv  i had high expectations for it  since smackdown is the best show in wwe  this is a very good ppv as it is the last one before wrestlemania   first match hardy boys   chris benoit vs  mvp   mnm w  melina in a   man tag team match good way to start the match  it started a bit slow at the start  but later the pace quickened   the match got more exciting   entertaining  benoit rolls through   makes joey mercury tap out to get a victory for the hardy boys   himself     second match  gregory helms  champion  vs  shannon moore vs  funaki vs  chavo guerrero vs  daivairi vs  scotty   hotty vs  jamie noble vs  jimmy wang yang in an open cruiserweight invitational match for the wwe cruiserweight championship i m a very big fan of cruiserweights    i never get disappointed watching them  especially in this match here  chavo guerrero nails the frog splash on jimmy wang yang to get the win   become the new wwe cruiserweight champion     third match  finlay   little bastard vs  boogeyman   little boogeyman this was not really a wrestling match  it was more like a comedy match  despite not being a clear wrestling contest  it still entertained me with the funny antics  finlay nails the little boogeyman with the shillaegh to get the win  boogeyman does not deserve to be on a ppv    does not deserve to be in wwe     fourth match  kane vs  king booker w  sharmell this was a surprisingly good match  i thought it would be mediocre  but it turned out into a real competitive wrestling contest  hats off to both men  pulling a very entertaining match  kane wins after a chokeslam on king booker     fifth match  paul london   brian kendrick  champions  vs  deuce   domino w  cherry for the wwe tag team championships not really that much of a good match  deuce   domino need more training to wrestle    london   kendrick are the only ones keeping this match fast paced  london   kendrick retain their titles  after kendrick gets a roll up on one of the guys for the win     sixth match  bobby lashley  champion  vs  mr  kennedy for the ecw championship mr  kennedy attacks lashley from behind  before the match starts  it was an okay match  but not really good  lashley   kennedy have a bit of chemistry  but not enough to pull a great match  kennedy wins by dq  after lashley nails him with a chair  then assaults him with the chair all the way to the entrance area  lashley still retains his title     seventh match  john cena   shawn michaels vs  batista   undertaker this is probably the greatest tag team match that i have ever seen  hats off to all of these men  yes even batista  for pulling off as close as a   star main event classic  all   of these men played their parts in the match very well  as this was a very great   entertaining tag team match  batista turns his back on undertaker spine busting him  then leaving the ring  which prompts michaels to nail sweet chin music  then cena to nail an f u for the hard fought victory     i don t know why everyone says that this ppv is not good enough  or it is boring  i just don t get it  it is a great ppv which smackdown always delivers  a great ppv indeed   overall i ll give it     a b
