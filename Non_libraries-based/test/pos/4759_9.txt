i was born in   with not much parental guidance as far as what i watched on tv  as a kid in the  s  i always loved this movie  and the french connection  and would always try to catch it whenever it was on  checking the sunday tv guide ahead of time  i bought it on dvd a few years ago and have watched it twice since then and i must say  i still love it  roy s  was a great actor from the  s  jaws is one of my all time favs  marathon man etc  and although the  ups is not an oscar worthy film  it puts you precisely in a time a place  ny  early  s  as did french connection  and gives you some tough characters and a glimpse of life as a cop at that time  and yes  the car chase is one of the all time best
