the title suggests that this movie is a sequel to  an american werewolf in london  none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren t even mentioned in this movie by name  so as a sequel  aawip fails  one would say   i dare to say the opposite   an american werewolf in paris is a charming  effective horror movie  it s one of the better werewolf films i have seen in a long time too  and i have seen quite my share  such as an american werewolf in london  the howling  wolfen  the wolfman and the underworld trilogy   the story tells of three americans visiting paris on a vacation  at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves a woman trying to commit suicide  what starts out as a romantic relationship slowly turns into a nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed   i really liked the acting in this film  especially the two stars of the movie  the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her  they have good chemistry together  but the other two americans also play their roles nicely  i didn t really find anything annoying about the acting  so thumbs up for that    the effects on the werewolves are nice  it doesn t look too cheap or fake to me  of course  the opinions are divided about this subject  but let s just say that i wasn t disappointed   there s also a good amount of humor in this movie  there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for a long time   so  to sum it up  an american werewolf in paris might not be a direct sequel to it s predecessor  but it s still an enjoyable movie  perfect for fans of werewolves    out of   stars
