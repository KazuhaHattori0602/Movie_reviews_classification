like most people out there who have watched james bond   movies  most people never knew that thunderball was originally the first   movie to be released  but after ian fleming  wrote the story with kevin mcclory and jack whittingham  the   other authors took ian fleming to court and won the case providing evidence that ian fleming took the ideas of spectre special executive in counterintelligence terrorism revenge extortion  so rather than making thunderball they fleming broccoli saltzman  went on to make dr no   this movie had the best of the best  from getting sean connery to come back one more time  he was paid over   for nsna  irvin kershner and sean connery had problems on the set  that much is true  but overall this movie was up there i think with thunderball  licence to kill  dr no  those are my favorite from the bond series  david dryer was hired for special photographic effects  he was working at the time on bladerunner before never say never again  the   million dollar yacht makes the disco volante  look like a canoe  this movie starred the best villian in a bond movie just behind dr no  klaus maria brandeau held together this neurotic business like calm manner  with a little wit to his authority over bond  barbara carrera was excellent as fatima blush   the music was better than every score that didnt contain john barry doing the backround score music in most bond films  michel legrand is not big in the usa compared to over in europe  he has played with miles davis and many other great jazz musicians over the years  its a little bland at times but the   theme that happens around   or   times in the movie never say never again is so cool  i like it more than the original     is back one more time  timothy dalton explained it right i thought  you cant relate to a superman or a superhero  he or she has to be human and have feelings  he was by far the best serious true to flemings version of bond  but sean connery proves he can still do the role that made him and others to follow  i bet at   now he could still pull off a villian role in a mcclory   movie if one ever surfaces
