centres on czech ww  pilots   the older frantisek  the boyish impulsive karel and in the background the quiet piano playing honza  as the film opens  it is   the war is over and frantisek and honza are imprisoned in a former monastery  in their now soviet controlled native country they are  enemy of the people  honza is severely maltreated by his communist countrymen and dies   in   many pilots manage to escape german occupied europe and make their way to england where they join the raf  notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face raf reluctance and british stiff upper lip  finally they fight gallantly in the battle of britain  however  frantisek and karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman   in terms of romantic sub plot  this is very similar to the hollywood production pearl harbour  however  given the context of the film and frantisek s eventual fate  it is also possible to read the english woman s treatment of the two men as symbolic of british treatment of the czech and polish raf pilots  conveniently forgetting them once the war is over   in addition  the film is a lot less clich  than pearl harbour and the characters are more fully realised  dark blue world also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights  which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models  actual live action aerial filming and out takes from the   epic the battle of britain   in short  dark blue world is a well made  moving  thought provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of pearl harbour to shame  highly recommended
