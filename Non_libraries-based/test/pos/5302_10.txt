this is the latest ghibli movie and it is also a major departure from the studio s established style  first of all  this film was obviously aimed at young children  much more so than any of their previous films  it lacks the depth of the other films and features a brand new far less realistic style of animation
 and yet it is ever so entertaining  even though there is nothing put in to attract adults  i still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story  the movie s secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters  the story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings intentions etc  but that makes them all the more endearing  special attention was also paid to the soundtrack which is absolutely amazing despite being way different from previous ghibli soundtracks  i find myself singing the cute theme song all the time as will anyone who sees this movie
