oh i remember watching this show at   p m  during my junior high days  it was not a pleasant experience because i remember watching it when i made my homework   still  the show caught my attention when alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems   but the show wasn t all about adventures and special powers  it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall   the lead actress  can t remember her name and i m too lazy to copy and paste from the main details  delivered a fantastic performance  she made the show watchable   they just don t make shows like this one anymore
