the first time i saw this film i was a kid  i was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters i saw it on network tv  i remember watching it alone
and crying afterward  it was only the second film to illicit that response  rocky was the first  and there haven t been many since  i can t say why exactly  larry  rain  murphy didn t deserve to win any more that rocky balboa or anyone else  i know i admired murphy  not so much for what he did  but for the way he did his time  stoic  he didn t need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity  he ran because he could  he needed no other reason  i have a rule today  that when i see this film late at night on cable television  the only time most will come across it  i must watch  no matter what i have to do the next morning  fortunately it doesn t play often like shawshank redemption or other favorites  so i still get plenty of sleep and i never tire of the story of one man s unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory
