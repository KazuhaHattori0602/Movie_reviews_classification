i heard they were going to remake this french classic in   and i see it is in development for   this will be a shame  as hollywood kicked writer director jules dassin out because of the infamous blacklist  they should not have the right to remake any of his films   i love  caper  films and  film noir  and this combines the best of both   tony  jean servais  gets out after doing a nickle  and after he beats up his old girlfriend  marie sabouret  he plans a big score with his friends mario  robert manuel  and jo  carl m hner  what makes this a great caper flick is the attention to detail in planning the robbery  you see that reflected in the george clooney vegas capers  nothing is left to chance   the caper goes off great but grutter  marcel lupovici  sends his sons  robert hossein and pierre grasset after tony and the gang  after blowing it with mario  they kidnap jo s son  lots of bullets fly before it is over   a great film by a great director  the standard by which other caper films are measured
