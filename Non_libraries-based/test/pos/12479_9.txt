great artists  always suffered while they were young  i could mention mozart and beethoven  but that is not the point    this movie was made by h g clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professions   its main star is louis jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming  the greatest actor  and also director of france s theater before and after wwii   they both had health problems  clouzot had tb while young  jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theater   such events shape the character of men  and women  of course  one might even say that today s artists are so poor  because they had never suffered and fought for their lives   to me  this is the greatest of clouzot s movies   wages of fear  is greater in  suspense   diabolique  also has more  suspense  and a better plot and is more about  female evil   quai des orf vres is more human  clouzot was falsely accused by de gaulle s entourage  mostly communists and jews  of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de gaulle left france s government in early   de gaulle came back in   as president   the main characters are all good souls  jenny l amour may perform as a  putain  on stage  but she is not a  whore   dictionaires make synonyms of those words  but they are not the same  loves her husband  and refuses the slight  advances from her  presumably lesbian  friend dora  the photographer   maurice the husband is jealous and timid  but runs away from the scene of the crime  he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for love   antoine  the detective  interpreted by the great louis jouvet  basically a stage actor  performs in this french  gray  not noir  as well as e g  robinson in  double indemnity  shows flair for pseudo criminals  tenderness for a negro son  and compassion for the true author of the crime  because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some nobleman s ch teau   clouzot was capable of slapping an actor s face in order to put him in the right frame of mind  but deep inside he was very human    i have his horoscope in front of me  he had venus in sagittarius which means open heartedness  devotion  charity and altruism  for those who do not believe in astrology  my most sincere apologies
