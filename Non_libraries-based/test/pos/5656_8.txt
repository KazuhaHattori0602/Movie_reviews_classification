this is undoubtedly the most harrowing black and white war film that i ve watched  as a matter of fact  the only western director during this time to remotely approach its level of intensity and sheer visceral power in his work was samuel fuller  by the way  i had attended a kon ichikawa retrospective at london s national film theatre in september   but only managed to catch some of his work made between   and    the film is certainly as depressing as it s reputed to be  however  it also displays welcome touches of black humor throughout   the  dead  man who wakes up to answer a querying soldier and promptly  dies  again  the deliciously ironic shoe exchange sequence  a moribund eccentric telling the famished hero which part of the body he should eat  etc  incidentally  the script was written by a woman   natto wada  the director s own wife   ichikawa is a versatile and prolific film maker whose reputation may not be as high as it was during his peak years   but his direction here is often striking   the startling pre credits sequence  the hero is violently rebuked by his superior officer for being discharged from hospital earlier than expected  the death of a surrendering japanese at the hands of a gun toting philippine woman  the bombing of a hospital  with the medical staff running away to save themselves  leaving the wounded soldiers behind to crawl out of the shack at their own limited pace  the automated march in the rain of the disillusioned soldiers  which also involves the afore mentioned business with the shoes that  actually  recalls a similar scene in all quiet on the western front [ ]  a hill littered with the bodies of soldiers attempting to climb it  the finale  etc  surely one of the film s major assets is the stunning cinematography of the unforgiving and desolate muddy landscape   the film is notorious for treating the taboo subject of cannibalism  almost   years before it became a staple of horror movies  but ichikawa s approach is not only subtle but highly effective  the flesh is actually referred to as  monkey meat  while the hero is seen partaking only once  and promptly spits out the piece along with most of his decaying teeth  conversely  when the weak underling soldier  played by mickey curtis who  despite his name  was a japanese pop idol of the time  rabidly indulges  the ground nearby is splashed with blood   in the supplements  ichikawa remembers that method practicing lead actor eiji funakoshi  whose portrayal is unforgettable  by the way  arrived on the set at starvation point   with the result that production was forced to shut down for two weeks until he recuperated  donald richie s perceptive interview favors the nihilism of the film over the underlying patriotism behind such gut wrenching recent hollywood fare as saving private ryan    fires on the plain is universally considered to be one of its director s top efforts and  out of the several films of ichikawa i ve watched  the closest to it in spirit are the burmese harp   another character driven war film but with a spiritual tone  and which is also available on dvd from criterion  and enjo aka conflagration   which was actually given a limited theatrical showing locally  as part of a foreign film week  a couple of years ago  personally  i also have a particular soft spot for the director s stunningly stylized color extravaganza  an actor s revenge   which i ve actually caught twice at the nft in   and the afore mentioned   retrospective
