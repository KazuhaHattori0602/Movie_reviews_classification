the chasers war on everything    words that i love to watch  the chasers war on everything is an excellent australian comedy  as the name suggests they wage war on everything  they seem to love hitting the politions most of all   the chaser is one of the best comedies i have seen and is the top of the line in australia  it is on the australian broadcasting corparation  abc  which is where some of the best comedies are   it has won the australian film industry  afi  awards but did not win the best comedy at the logies    last year   the chaser was aired on abc on friday nights when everyone was out so no one could watch it  well they have been moved to wednesday nights at  pm  a heaps better timeslot  and the best thing is if i miss an episode or even just want to see it again i can download it from   abc net au chaser
