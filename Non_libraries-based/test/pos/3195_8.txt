i recalled watching this program as a young boy in australia in the  s  and enjoyed it on dvd again as a  year old father of young kids  although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence  i am very happy to have my   and  year old kids watch this because the central characters are deep  kind and honourable  the japanese culture shines through  the violence is not gory  nobody glories in it  and the program is beautiful to watch  it does not promote nightmares  but instead it shows much of the culture that must have primarily influenced the design of jedi knights in star wars    the quality of the dvds does leave something to be desired  video perfectionists will not like this one  it is strongly reminiscent of something held on  mm film and projected onto the wall in some basement  which it may well be  the soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we have come to expect from home theatre  however  my kids noticed only that it was not in colour  and i suspect they only noticed that because we had been talking recently about how old things are often like that  the beauty of mt fuji is evident even in b w  something about the  th century setting makes the quality part of the atmosphere  as if you peer into the past through some time window   overall this program is better than most things on the air  and a far better advertisement for japanese tv than pokemon  but you may consider it of marginal value if you did not have the experience of seeing it back in the  s  my score of   takes its age into account
