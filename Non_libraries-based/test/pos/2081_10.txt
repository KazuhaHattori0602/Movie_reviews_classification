caught this film on tcm in the early a m  it was amazing   starting out slow but ominously  scott is a shady character who preys on women  in this case  two women who happen to be due an inheritance in southern california   the sets of the beach and neighborhoods of the  s are original and intriguing  the title may have been more creative  but the theme and nefarious shadows of human nature are intriguingly exposed  almost in a hitchcockian version   scott reminded me of the character uncle charley in  shadow of a doubt  one of hitch s reputed favorite films  the audience learns we truly do not know what lurks in the dark side of the human mind this film is a displaced gem and well worth purchasing
