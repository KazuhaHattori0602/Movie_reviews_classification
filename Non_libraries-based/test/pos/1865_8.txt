i saw this film on  sep  at the cambridge film festival    the beagle s only in a couple of short flashbacks  the whole thing is about darwin s life from   to   when he was ensconced in kent with his growing family    pages of origin had already been drafted and he was wondering whether to complete the book    the script is based on randal keynes s book annie s box  annie  charles s daughter  died when she was   it is mostly a family drama  but does include sex scenes   however  the participants are married  both on and off screen  not too exciting  not much science but a well made film that s pleasant to watch and pushes the right emotional buttons  a bit of a romantic weepie  actually  i suppose the conclusion is that you can be an agnostic free thinking scientist from an atheist family background and still be an emotional romantic as well as an excellent father    some of the characters and darwin himself state or wonder whether he  killed god  but the viewer is able to doubt that  what is beyond doubt  given the deadly struggle for survival and the web of predation on the meadow bank  well known before darwin and completely uncontroversial  and the failure of darwin s prayers is that the idea of a kind  providential god who loves  his  creatures is untenable    i really cannot see many americans objecting to it very much  some may have problems with the title  which is probably the most controversial thing about the film  or with the fact that bettany does not have horns  a tail and a pitchfork
