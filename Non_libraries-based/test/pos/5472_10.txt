to those of you who ve made comments on this film earlier and hoped to see it again  i hope you did  it was broadcast today  nov   th  on lifetime movie network  i subscribe to dish   karen arthur directed william petersen and barbara hershey in this southwestern gothic like tale  expertly  the lighting  editing and dialog contributed greatly to the film and hershey and peterson were perfectly cast for the roles  both playing sensitive  bold and intuitive characters  the screen play was excellent  as well the supporting cast   not having known ahead of time  i guessed correctly the story was based on truth  and now that i know it i must make the sojourn  as santa fe is a hop  skip and a jump from tucson   as an engineer  i was fascinated with the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it  who was he  an angel  but the storyline  and it s several plots  of how it came to be is what most captivates you  you certainly get a strong sense that god in his heaven was in every detail of this entire drama in history  for you who have seen the film  you know what i m talking about  for those of you who haven t  i won t spoil a minute of it   bon holiday   bob shank jr  raytheon missile systems  tucson  az
