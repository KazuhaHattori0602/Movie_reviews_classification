with the exception of the main character  the acting didn t convince me  but the story was quite good  it s about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young mormon missionary  as you can imagine  such a relationship is quite problematic  the movie is very american and  as such  has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance  but some story lines are hilarious  one of the main characters asks his gay colleague   do you believe in god  and he answers   
you mean  other than madonna  all in all  the film is not one of my all time favorites  but the script is really good and i really liked it  it s entertaining and stands up against  religious  prejudice and intolerance  i think this is an important message in our times  since i rated films that i liked less with   this is clearly a   for me  some people may find this exaggerated  but i think this film deserves it
