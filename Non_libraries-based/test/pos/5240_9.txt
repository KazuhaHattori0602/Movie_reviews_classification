i just recently bought  the big trail    it s an awesome  amazing film  i knew it by reputation but never expected it to be so magnificent  my version is the one shot in  mm and i ll speak of that again later  when one thinks of the western myth in film the names that come to mind are john ford and john wayne  well  you have only half the team here  but the entire myth is present  raoul walsh has given us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the struggle of the westward expansion of the nation    there is a plot centering on a romance between breck coleman  wayne  and ruth cameron  margaret churchill  with the main villain  red flack being memorably played by tyrone power  sr  but this has an almost incidental quality as the wagon train struggles forward against incredible obstacles both natural and human  examples are the crossing of the river  the indian battle  and traversing the burning desert  the aftermath of the battle is given a sombre touch when a doll is placed on the grave of a child killed while a faithful dog lies down on its master s grave   magnificent panoramas are filled with energy and activity  the opening scene as the wagon train prepares to leave  the square dance interlude and the great buffalo herds are some that spring to mind  marvellous use is made of location shooting throughout  another feature of this splendid film is the fact that men and women are given equal credit for their parts in the great struggle westward  women work  fight  and confront the terrible hardships with the same fortitude and strength as their male counterparts  the finale has a powerfully uplifting experience as coleman and cameron meet in the gigantic towering sequoia forest to start their new life    the acting is quite acceptable throughout  i ve already mentioned tyrone power s scene stealing performance  tully marshall is excellent as coleman s sidekick  and marguerite churchill convincingly portrays a woman who develops an inner strength as she encounters her own problems as well as those external to herself  the comic relief is the weakest aspect of this film  but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the film   i ve read much criticism of wayne s performance some even going so far as to blame his  wooden acting  for the failure of the film at the box office  i think this is unfair  wayne was in his first major role and certainly had not developed the charisma of his performance in  stagecoach  but he still does a serviceable job in a role which is certainly going to play second fiddle to the great over arching theme  after  the big trail  wayne played in a large number of low budget b westerns  i have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them  when  stagecoach  came he was ready for it and  the big trail  was a significant part of that apprenticeship   i mentioned earlier that my version is the one shot in  mm  it s still impressive  but to get some idea of the effect of the  mm version i set the tv screen to   which doesn t cause any distortion  while not having the complete effect of the grandeur version  it was good enough to make me want to get the latter   in addition  the film shot in  mm has a few extra scenes not in the form made for ordinary theatrical showing   all in all  this film deserves to be in any list of the greatest westerns ever made
