admittedly alex has become a little podgey  but they are still  for me  the greatest rock trio  ever  i wholeheartedly recommend this dvd to any fan   i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent munich gig  logistics  and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere  the dvd is a small consolation   the greatest incentive to acquire a proper dvd playback setup   naive perhaps  but i still don t understand the significance of the tumble driers on stage  i would be grateful for any clarification   cheers  iain
