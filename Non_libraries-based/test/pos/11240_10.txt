there are too many people on this board who have obviously missed the subtle wit of this series    this show is great because it s a hilarious parody of itself  guys who are self proclaimed studs are given a fair chance to convince us of their seduction abilities until they  hit the field  just to expose their complete lack of  game  on national tv   it s absolutely hilarious and the guys who are actually skilled are extremely compelling to watch as they effortlessly seduce the pretentious women that frequent these trendy nightclubs    it celebrates unique charisma when deserved and mocks delusional douchebags when deserved  either way  it s always entertaining because  unlike other dating shows  it perfectly captures the authentic awkwardness and excitement of a  pickup  i highly recommend this show to anyone with a sense of humor
