the cure is one of the few movies i rated   out of   i mean  everything is flawless for me in this motion picture  i saw it almost a year ago  and yet i remember many of the scenes  especially the final touching scene that comes with the credits   the two boy actors clearly gave everything they could and this greatly contributes the excellent storyline  making the film perfect   the message is clear   friendship  and it s displayed throughout the whole thing   i have nothing more to say here  simplicity is one of the things i love so much about this film  and of course  it s fun and moving at the same time  suiting people of any age     nicely done
