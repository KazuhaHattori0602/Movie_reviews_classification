it s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead  this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich  you cant help but like it   i think the story was a little rushed at the end  but extending that would have made the story even longer  superior to other romantic comedies such as   days with mr arrogant  and possibly tied with my tutor friend   it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema  not as great as my sassy girl  but still good
