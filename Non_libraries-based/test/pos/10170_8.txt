many people have the irritating habit of dying before completing a vital message  thus confusing the hero  not to mention the audience   dr  ben mckenna  james stewart  and his wife jo  a former musical star  doris day  are vacationing in morocco with their son  hank  christopher olsen  when they meet mr  and mrs  drayton  a british couple  brenda de banzie and bernard miles  they are also befriended by a charming frenchman  louis bernard  daniel gelin  who invites them to dinner but then cancels at the last minute   the mackennas go to a restaurant and end up having their meal with the draytons  when they spot louis bernard    the next day in the market place  they are caught in an assassination intrigue  while they are wandering in the local market  the crowds suddenly scatter to reveal an arab fleeing from his pursuers  dr  mckenna stands amazed as the arab falls into his arms  a knife sticking out of his back    gulping his last breath  the dying man mutters some words and collapses  dr  mckenna is completely taken aback when the arab s hood falls from his head and he is revealed as bernard in disguise  mckenna is left knowing too little  but as far as the assassins are concerned  too much   to prevent dr  mckenna from revealing what he knows  the conspirators kidnap his son as a hostage  the film is primarily concerned with the dilemma of kidnapping how to get the little boy back safely  the subplot about the assassination is just the setup   the film is a breathless escapade  the death of bernard comes suddenly and points out that death comes when we least expect it    stewart is charged with emotion as the midwestern doctor  accidentally involved in political intrigue  his perceptive facial expressions and indignant delivery made him convincingly human a person we could easily identify with  it is his temperament that actually sets the pace for the entire film    by   the lovely doris day had won increasing esteem as an actress as well as a singer  she had been particularly strong opposite james cagney in the ruth etting s biopic   love me or leave me  but she was still unsure of her basic thespian talents   the casting of character actor reggie malder as the assassin  is brilliant  the man looks like a menace and his effusive portrayal radiates evil
