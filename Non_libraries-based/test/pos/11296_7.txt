i just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding dvd version for one dollar at wal mart   run out and buy it   i m fairly sure that this version is the short  incomplete version released against the animator s wishes in the late fifties  but even so  at a buck it s an  incredible  bargain   this film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local tv stations in the early  s for the kid s shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days    mr bill and bozo   monty s gang   channel   greenville sc  and  captain grady   channel   asheville nc   which is where i saw it  it made such an impression on twelve or so old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in wal mart tonight and grabbed it   wonderful  you should get it
