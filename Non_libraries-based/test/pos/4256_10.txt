if you get a chance to get a hold of this lost  for many years  gem  i doubt you will be disappointed  ps has an odd blend of social satire and ultra cool blaxploitation  even hints of slapstick  but it s so odd that it was not only ahead of it s time  nothing has been seen like it since   i strongly disagree with people who say that the film is dated  especially with spike lee s  bamboozaled   sp  a few years back which was a misfire of trying to capture the same message   good filmmaking  disjointed script   robert downy s direction is brilliant  allowing many of his actors to improvise  the film gets better as it goes along and the jokes swagger from hit or miss one liners that are as forgiven as those found in a mel brooks comedy  to sheer non pc  i can t believe they just said that  fun   favorite parts  the commercials  the film switches from gritty black and white depictions of the ad agency to beautiful  perhaps  mm  color and gets away with it    i refuse to hint at any spoilers  but if you get the chance to see the dvd version be sure and watch the downey interview  but leave it until after the movie    my vote   most underrated film of the late  s  early  s  thank you prince
