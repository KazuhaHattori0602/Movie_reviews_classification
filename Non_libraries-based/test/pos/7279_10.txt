wow  i loved this movie  this film was filled with plot twists  good acting  great story  and a surprising ending  to be completely honest this movie wasn t overly gory  it does contain some gore  though  but was more on the psychological side  i read it on the internet  the film cost   dollars and was shoot in   days  amazing  this is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making  what starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted  even a bit more sinister  not much i can say without giving away plot points only that this movie went beyond my expectations
