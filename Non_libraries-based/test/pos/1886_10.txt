this is screamingly funny  well  except when bruce is in the hospital scene  which is a little sad    ted raimi and stacy keach are both excellent and worth watching   sure  it s not a big budget suit controlled blockbuster  but it s everything it promises to be and more  and btw  the women are wonderful in their parts  though i don t know them from other movies  i d welcome seeing them again   the two brain walking scene is inspired and certainly a showcase for bruce s outstanding physical comedy  he is one yummy guy   thanks bruce  for your brain  this is your baby
