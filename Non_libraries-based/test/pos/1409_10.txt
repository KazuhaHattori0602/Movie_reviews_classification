it is a shame that this series hasn t been remastered and produced on video by warner or some other professional movie house   copies of most episodes are available  but are usually of poor quality  being copies of copies of copies   as i understand it    episodes were produced during its run  but only   are noted here   some of the series writers  such as richard matheson  went on to become noted authors   excellent series  well written  well staged and well produced   michael weldon   udon thani  thailand
