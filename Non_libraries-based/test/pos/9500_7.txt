don t change your husband is  on the one hand  the beginning of a series of lightweight marital comedies from cecil b  demille  on the other it is his first picture to star gloria swanson  probably the greatest actress of the silent era  and is the film which made her a star   although the old demille formula was beginning to change  and his films were becoming wordier and less purely visual  with such an expressive performer as swanson we regain much of that silent storytelling style  her character does very little  but conveys volumes through subtle gesture and facial expression   with a particular talent for looks of disdain  in real life swanson was herself coming towards the end of her disastrous marriage to wallace beery  and it s possible that this fact fuelled her convincing performance   as if to best complement his leading lady s talents  demille s use of framing and close ups is particularly strong here  he uses cinematic technique to show off the acting   often holding swanson in lengthy close ups at key moments   and also to clarify the story visually  for example  when we are introduced to the character of toodles  she is shown reflected three times in a dressing table mirror  her character disappears from the story  only to become important towards the end  that attention grabbing first shot of her helps us remember who she was  later  at the anniversary dinner  swanson and future husband number two lew cody are framed together in one shot  while elliot dexter is isolated in his own frame  also   and this is a sign of the increasing sophistication of cinema in general   there is much use of reaction shots   for example the disapproving glance of the bishop when cody acts out his intentions with the wedding figure dolls   in contrast to demille s visual narrative method was the increasingly verbose screen writing of his collaborator jeanie macpherson  as i ve remarked in several other comments  macpherson could put together a strong and dramatic story  but like demille she tended to state her themes in a somewhat pretentious and flamboyant style  and so we get these very long quasi philosophical title cards about the pitfalls of married life which  if they improve the story at all  it is only because they are unintentionally funny  for example  only jeanie macpherson could come up with a line like  fate sometimes lurks in christmas shopping  fortunately though in this picture these titles mostly introduce scenes rather than break them up   although the pictures he made around this time tended to be small scale  it is at this point that demille seemed to develop his taste for the spectacular  you can see him start to sneak in excuses for a bit of razzmatazz like the little fantasy scenes of swanson being showered with  pleasure  wealth and love  it wouldn t be until the early twenties after the unofficial embargo on historical pictures was lifted that he would get the chance to go all out with the grand spectacle   all in all  don t change your husband is a fairly decent demille silent picture  although to be honest it is only really the presence gloria swanson that lifts it above the average  it s curious though that this is supposedly a comedy  and swanson was cast at least in part because of her background at mack sennett s slapstick factory  she hated comedy acting  and here gives a dramatic rather than a comic performance  it makes sense then that the only straight drama she did with demille  male and female  was by far the strongest of their collaborations
