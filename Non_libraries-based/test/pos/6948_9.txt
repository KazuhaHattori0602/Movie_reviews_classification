this show came to canada via pbs in the mid  s and i really  really loved it then  even   yrs later watching the various news networks  i cant help but think of the cynical manipulation that goes on in the name of ratings and the various  show ponies  we all see on tv as depicted in various frontline episodes  the scripts are tightly written and the actors all have impeccable comic timing and none of it is encumbered by an idiotic laugh track  there is a lot of funny material here really well executed and we don t need to be told when to laugh and what to laugh at  i don t understand why this show never took off in north america as its truly a gem  i was really excited to see the dvds available  even though they are pal format  i figured i would rip them to my computer and then watch the converted files  i took a chance and ordered it from abc
   to   weeks later  i had all   seasons  even better it worked on my ntsc dvd player  i suspect any player bought in the past   yrs that does xvid divx will play them  great stuff    yrs later the episodes all hold up really well  you don t need to know anything about australian politics to get the humor as it will all be familiar to western audiences  my wife and i had a   day frontline fest and are still chuckling weeks later after watching all   episodes
