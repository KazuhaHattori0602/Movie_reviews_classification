one of the myths of the early sound era is that they couldn t make westerns because they had trouble recording sound on location  in fact  it was the financial restrictions of the depression that temporarily killed off the genre  at least in the  a  budget bracket  however  in the period   before the economic downturn had really kicked in  the  a  western flourished  notable examples including the virginian  billy the kid and cimarron  the big trail was perhaps the biggest of them all   a gargantuan pioneer western shot in an early widescreen process appropriately titled grandeur  thanks to a recent dvd release we now get to see the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen that was shot simultaneously   the director was raoul walsh  a man for whom the spirit of adventure lay in vast outdoor vistas  and thus in many ways a perfect choice  he makes great use of the wider frame to show off the western landscape at its most breathtaking  very typical of walsh are a number of shots towards the beginning  such as the one where a woman is chopping firewood  most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other clutter  but in one corner we see the wilderness stretching out invitingly  when the wagon train gets going  the open plain is gradually revealed to us  with wagons pulling away like stage curtains  these shots are not so effective in the fullscreen version  yet on the wider canvas walsh s expression of the outdoors was never better   but there s an unfortunate flipside to this  when it comes to dialogue scenes  walsh s tendency is to place the actors in the middle of the shot  as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen box  the extra width becomes just that   extra  it may seem logical at first  because it means that height wise we see as much of the actors as we would in a fullscreen picture  however it makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame  while all the background business dominates the shot   and there is a lot of background business in the big trail  when widescreen formats re emerged in the  s  many directors would make the same mistake  before eventually realising that in talkie scenes it is better to frame actors from around the chest up  losing some of their height but allowing them to fill the screen   it s a pity  because the big trail is a particularly well balanced and finely scripted effort  the romance and revenge subplots are simple but well defined  and do not threaten to overbalance each other or the pioneer story  it could have been a great intimate epic  but it loses dramatic weight because every time characters start talking to each other we get distracted by herds of cattle  drifting wagons or whatever else is filling every spare inch of frame  still  walsh s sensitivity to deeply emotional romantic moments is still on display  and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable  there are also some nice comedy touches  largely courtesy of  comical swede  el brendel   the big trail is also notable for being john wayne s first lead role  while wayne is another victim of the distant framing in dialogue scenes  we do at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but assertive vocal delivery  he betrays his lack of experience  but the potential is clearly there  sadly that potential wasn t widely realised at the time and he spent the rest of the decade slumming it in b pictures before he finally hit stardom  also appearing in this picture is wayne s buddy  and later prolific character actor  ward bond  he s not credited  but you can spot him in a number of scenes  most prominently around the  minute mark where he is stood to tyrone power s left   the big trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama  and it was this stupendous scale that would put the western  and widescreen  to bed for some time  and although the  s and  s are now regarded as the golden age of the western  it was by then a changed genre  with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established west   no better or worse  but of a different form  the early talkie period was the end of an era in which westerns could be truly gigantic
