i shall begin with a disclaimer  this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff  the game before watching  the movie relies on the audience s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements  and it does so very subtly  do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it ll be that much better   with that in mind  this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed  the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game  on steroids  yeah  the attention to detail in each scene  especially in the heavy action oriented ones  is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe   i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music  again  for those who are familiar with the ff  story and background  the music should not surprise anyone  although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation   once again  i myself having only played through ff  once  thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix  and that is the feel in most scenes  choreographed and organized  like a dance   in short  if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy   this film will blow you out of the water  if you re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff  on playstation or pc  doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience   finally  i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film  characters move with fluidity  each scene background comes to life and tells its own story  for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot  i urge you to reexamine the animation  facial reactions  subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery   square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling  advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations  allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves   thanks square enix  the wait was well worth it
