this is the very first three stooges short with shemp that i saw  and it is one of my favorites    that is what i really liked about shemp when he returned after curly s stroke  he did not try to be like curly  he was his own character  and that is what i admire  shemp is my favorite third stooge  i like him more than curly  but i like curly as much as i do shemp  shemp is great  he s funny  he s silly  he s shemp    i really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel and moe got into the booth with him to find it and they ended up getting tangled in the wires and really badly hurt    but what i really thought was scary was when shemp had his face smashed against the glass of the phonebooth  he looked like a deformed professor snape   poor shemp  he had a lot of bad things happen to him in this short  but that is just typical three stooges  they always have a lot of bad things happening to them    this short is another must see for three stooges fans
