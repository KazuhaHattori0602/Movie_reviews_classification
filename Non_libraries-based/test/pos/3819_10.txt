i first started watching the outer limits back in   when i was   and it just blew my mind every week with each episode  every episode had a twist and each week i couldn t wait for the next  how the writers managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each over a course of   seasons is beyond me  this show manages to teach us about life  robotics  alien and human encounters  and an insight into more of the paranormal  and how it affects the people  what really makes this a good show are the characters in each episode  they really show emotion and are really good actors  what you ll also notice each week is an actor actress you ll know from a past show which is pretty neat in its own way   if you wanna chill out  and sit back with a good sci fi show  then the outer limits is for you
