alright  i m   so this is where you get to see the movie from a pre teen s point of view  i ve also commented on magnolia and bicentennial man  both great movies  if you want to check it out  alright  here on earth was a beautiful movie with astounding scenes and images  very pleasing to the eye  the writer  i don t know who it was  check imdb  either worked very hard or has a good appreciation for love  poetry  and drama  i cried   times throughout this movie  once for over   minutes  it was really sad  really beautiful  really meaningful  it s a great movie for anyone  say    and up who isn t a romantic comedy freak  yeah  it s romantic  yeah  it s comedic  but  in my opinion  it s better than  she s all that  or  whatever it takes  i never cry  it s a tender story  go rent it and tape it
