i am a huge tenacious d fan  and i think this is not the funniest movie in the world  but the most entertaining  it s not laugh a minute but that s not what the d intended it to be  i went into the movie seeing all the hbo shows  memorized both albums  and that made it even more enjoyable  plenty of inside jokes from past tenacious d albums  and hbo shows  since i knew the new album already  i knew   minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy  i would say it has the best first   minutes of any movie and the best last   minutes of any movie  hands down   see this movie now
