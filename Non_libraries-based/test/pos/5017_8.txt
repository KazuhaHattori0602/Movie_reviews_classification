what is it about certain films that generates such polar opposite reactions   some people here have called high roller  disgusting  some have called it  extraordinary   as would i  actually   why  i think it s because films like this don t make heroes out of jerks  or glamour out of degeneration  and some people just can t deal with that emotionally  they need a hero  and i d also add that if they re gamblers or poker players  they might feel personally betrayed when their existence isn t justified   high roller in not a poker movie  it s a people movie  it s not perfect  but it looks good  is well written  and wonderfully acted  and best of all  it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection   and maybe that s what makes some people so damn mad
