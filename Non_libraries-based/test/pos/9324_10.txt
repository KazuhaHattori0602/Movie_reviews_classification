for those too young to remember  or too old to have been part of the  hype  the michael jackson fad in the early to mid  s was at a fever pitch  like the hype about titanic  except this just didn t let up  every song  every video  every word uttered by michael was important  nothing similar had been seen since the heyday of the beatles   i remember seeing this video for the first time  at a roller skating rink  everyone stopped skating  there was no question as to whether you were a michael jackson fan or not  you were  everyone crowded around the projection screen  and watched the video   this is probably one of the longest music videos ever made  and definitely the best  it perpetually gets   on the annual mtv top   videos   is always the flavor of the month  and somehow whatever was   of all time slips past   to make way for the new   go figure  and thriller became a phenomenon in and of itself   if you ever get the chance  you must watch the video  not just the excerpts shown on mtv or vh  if necessary  you should search out making of thriller at a video rental store  hey  your parents probably made you watch beatles and woodstock footage because  it was important  well  this is important too
