having seen the original when i was    and  yes  i was stupid enough to watch it while babysitting  i was excited to see this remake   camilla bell did a great job as jill johnson  and the fact that a teen horror flick could be made in the year   without tremendous vulgarity and gore  made it even that much stronger of a film  i had a great time trying not to chew my fingernails off   this film won t win anyone an oscar  but it is entertaining and worth the matin e price ticket i bought to see it  i think girls around the world should watch the original and the remake and then determine to never babysit again    all i can say is  i m glad i m too old to babysit  there s just something about being in a dark creepy house with sleeping kids that makes this movie classic  no blood  no gore just good psychological fun  winner
