i was never all that impressed by night gallery  but this one episode stands out   a tv network executive auditions an odd act   a young  nerdy boy who proceeds to make prognostications  the exec dismisses the whole thing as a flaky waste of time until both predictions come true the next morning   what first seemed a parlor act becomes a hit show as the kid s predictions prove consistently accurate   then  one day  he refuses to do the show  facing imminent showtime  everyone s at wit s end  even threatening him with legal action if he doesn t fulfill his contract and make his daily predictions   the young boy relents  and foretells a seemingly utopian tomorrow   after the show  the befuddled executive asks for an explanation  only to learn why the complete truth is too terrifying to reveal
