i had to call my mother  a wasp  to ask her about this  was it really that bad in the  s in new york  surprise  she couldn t remember  so i told her to see the movie  arthur miller  in not a screen play but a novel for a change  was   when he wrote this in   it is a painful depiction of anti semitism  yet oddly enough  there is a tender story of human relationships  finkelstein  the jew  with newman  the non jew  primarily  underlying the cruel story  the acting is competent and the cinematography is very good   the only reason i can think of for this not making it big in the theatre is that it s  aaagh  i actually give it ten of ten  maybe a bit high  but it s so worth seeing
