   man anyone walking into this film expecting to see a brainless comedy will surely be disappointed  i always wonder how some people are film marketers when i see how misleading their marketing campaigns   man of the year  is a great example of bad and misleading marketing  because everything from the poster  to the trailer  to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy  i would honestly have to say about   of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think  i kind of wonder in this case if the marketing was done on purpose since this film addresses pretty serious issues in between its comedy routine   but enough about marketing  lets get down to the film itself   i really liked  man of the year  even though i was expecting to see a comedy instead of a serious film  one of the many things i will give this film credit for is that the film does a decent job switching between comedy and drama even though at first it seems a little awkward  i really think that after you figure this out that the movie is going to be more of a political thriller than a comedy you get comfortable with it  some may not because they are lead to believe that they are seeing a comedy and don t understand what this film is trying to say in the end but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film right    man of the year  talks about a lot of things and seems to have a very strong opinion  as tom dobbs speaks he is saying things that need to be said and isn t about candy coating them  i also think the whole political subplot  while most critics say hurt the film probably again because of the misleading marketing  was very good  the idea of computerize voting has been tossed around the last few years and with all the problems computers have the issue being addressed in this film could surely be realistic  also the control big businesses have over voting also gets addressed   as far as acting goes  i think everyone involved did a good job  robin williams had a chance to be funny yet serious at the same time by playing tom dobbs  some say that williams has overstayed his welcome as a comedian but i personally still think he is funny and he s a good serious actor as well  this is probably one of the few occasions though that we get to see him go back and forth from serious to funny and i think it works well  also it s nice to see lewis black co star in a decent film  again i like black when he appears on  the daily show  and does stand up however most of the films he has been in were awful  this was a good movie for him because i think his political views fit in with the story that director barry levinson was trying to convey  laura linney is a fine addition to the cast and proves once again that she is a very good actress and lastly christopher walken and jeff goldblum both do a very good job as always with this roles handed to them    man of the year  was written and directed by barry levinson  the man who has brought us such films as  rain man   good morning vietnam  and  wag the dog  levinson does a fine job writing the film and directing it  like i said i know a lot of critics didn t like the whole political thriller aspect of the film but i thought it fit in nicely  it was actually nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to both think and laugh at the same time  barry levinson did a fine job with this film   in the end  don t go into this film expecting to see the movie that the commercials are selling you  it does have laughs but at the same time it plays off more as a political drama  it s not as stupid or silly as the marketing campaign leads you to believe  i really liked the fact that this film that this film wasn t a typical hollywood film  it tried to be a comedy and a serious drama at the same time and worked at least for me  i like the fact that the film didn t really tone down any of the issues it addressed nor did it have a typical hollywood ending  i was trying to call the ending from the get go but surprisingly it didn t end the way i thought which made me happy  it s a movie that will make you laugh but then a few minutes later allow you to think and wonder what s going to happen next  i think its a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing
