i love military comedies  sgt  bilko  stripes  in the army now  major payne  and down periscope is hilarious  but it has a heart as well   the stingray ss   the uss pampanito  was gorgeous  absolutely beautiful  a piece of art come alive  so it was a diesel engine sub  so what  i learned that the aircraft carrier uss ranger  which stood in for the enterprise in star trek iv  a huge ship  was  conventionally powered  which might mean that ranger was a diesel too   my favorite scene  pascal  jesus  buckman  this can s been on the stingray since korea  this can expired in   buckman   takes finger full and tastes it  what s the matter  sir  it still tastes like creamed corn   pascal   yelling  except  it s deviled ham  buckman  that would be a problem   it s story  perhaps a wee strained  seemed plausible  winslow respected dodge  and seemed to care about him  so he wanted to give dodge a chance  he gave him a battered but still seaworthy balao class sub  and assigns him the task of using the diesel sub to evade the nuclear navy and  attack  charlston harbor  and norfolk   star admiral graham  with his eye on his third star  and a grudge against dodge  assigned him the ragtag crew  hoping that they would screw up so dodge would lose  can tom dodge get the crew up to speed and working as a team  and can he take an old  out of date sub  and beat the navy s best
