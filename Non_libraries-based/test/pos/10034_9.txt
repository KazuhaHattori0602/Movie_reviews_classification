it s true that  they died with their boots on  gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custer s  errol flynn  life and career  but a remarkable one  especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn  because it is not a given that a   movie tries to portray both the us american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse  anthony quinn  in a favorable light  i m almost tempted to say that  little big man  in its unqualified anti custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison  further  one should not be mislead by the title of the picture   this isn t just a movie about the battle of the little big horn  it s a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet  the famed civil war hero  the indian fighter  and  last but not least  the husband   the movie begins with custer s time at the west point military academy  where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits  during a punitive military exercise  he meets his future wife  elizabeth bacon  olivia de havilland  who  like custer himself  is a native of monroe  michigan  custer intends to court her  but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away  custer s legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes  the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg  while on leave  he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth  who promises him her hand in matrimony  immediately after the war  custer and elizabeth bacon are married   with the civil war over  custer is demoted  doesn t get a real command  and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small  professional american army  as he starts to drink  his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general in chief winfield scott  custer is given the command of the us  th cavalry  which he trains to be an elite unit  neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle  but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties  custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horse s cause  but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier  exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle    they died with their boots on  though short on historical accuracy  is as good as war movies and westerns in the  s got  both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors  neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated  and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming  the only minus  and that s why i can t give this picture a full   is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants  elizabeth s servant callie is the stereotypical  overweight  good natured  superstitious black mammy   it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse  but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans  just a couple of years later  the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers   needless to say that  they died with their boots on  omits the fact that custer s overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy  greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart  and doesn t mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn  nevertheless  custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station  gettysburg  trevilian station and others  though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as  they died with their boots on  suggests   in any event   they died with their boots on  is a well made war movie with western elements  three outstanding performers  flynn  quinn  and de havilland  and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money  which wouldn t be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come  it would deserve a   if it weren t for the racist minstrelization of african americans
