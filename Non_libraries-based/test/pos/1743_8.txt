i was very disappointed when this show was canceled  although i can not vote  i live on the island of aruba  i sat down to see the show on tuesday  and was very surprised that it didn t aired  the next day i read on the internet that it was canceled   it s true not every one was as much talented as the other  but there were very talented people singing   i find it very sad for them   that they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down   its a pity  ariette croes
