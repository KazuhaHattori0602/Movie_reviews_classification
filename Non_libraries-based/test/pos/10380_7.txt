nva combines eastalgia humor  military comedy and teen movie  although it is somehow typically german movie like sentimental  i think it s a great and very funny movie  you will not only laugh in nva but also get a bit of an insight in the eastern germany armed forces of the late  ies and how the young recruits as well as the professional soldiers experienced the fall of the berlin wall and the end of the german democratic republic   you will enjoy nva if you liked sonnenallee  another movie directed by leander hau mann  but not necessarily if you enjoyed good bye lenin which is much more serious and less obviously funny   the acting is acceptable  but watch for former boy band singer kim frank who has only two facial expressions  natural and shocked saucer eyed
