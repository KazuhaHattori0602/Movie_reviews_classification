a mix of  s drug humor along with parody of medicine and classic story line  as i ve often said about this flick   if you don t get it   you re way lame  classic lines such as  parapharsed   i ve got this erection and it won t go away no matter how many times i do it  you re a nurse  what can you give me for it  nurse replies  all i have is   dollars and my wedding ring  great sound track the classic  hyde s got nothing to hide  stays surprisingly close to the original plot   not that the original stays in the way of a joke  haven t met anyone with an iq over   that doesn t find it hysterical
