 minor spoiler    inhabited isn t scary  but it is creepy  it is an interesting  little  story with good acting and great special effects makeup   basic plot  a little girl blames the strange things going on at her family s new house and accompanying playhouse on her faerie friends   the movie doesn t waste time getting moving  though the ending could have been more involved   i don t recommend this movie to those expecting wanting hardcore horror  but i do recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thriller
