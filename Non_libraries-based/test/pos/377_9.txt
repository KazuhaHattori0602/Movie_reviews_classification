in alfred hitchcock s adaptation of patricia highsmith s  strangers on a train  guy haines  farley granger and bruno anthony  robert walker meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders  the rather pushy anthony suggests that he could murder haines  unfaithful wife and haines could murder anthony s domineering father  the lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved  the tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious  complications arise later when anthony murders haines  wife in an amusement park and then pursues haines to keep his side of the bargain   the differences between the two men are clear from the start  haines is a professional tennis player  respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas anthony s life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling  haines is in a relationship with a senator s daughter who he wants to marry  anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on haines  part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career  the character differences are also reinforced visually  anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called  pluto  whereas haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles   there are some striking visual sequences such as      the murder of haines  wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from anthony     the depiction of anthony alone  dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white jefferson memorial building     the occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison  following the action  whilst one head  anthony s  chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at haines    the scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly   frequent use is made of  doubles  throughout the story  for example  haines and anthony are originally introduced as   pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train  as the train pulls out of the station  there are   sets of tracks each providing a choice of   ways forward  the   men discuss the murders of   potential victims and order   double whiskies  the hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass  haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce  haines  wife goes to the amusement park with   boyfriends  when anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces   reflections in her glasses  anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the senator s younger daughter who he sees as a double for haines  wife  anthony also feels double crossed when haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder  when haines is travelling alone in a train going to metcalf  he sees   men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and anthony had   the action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of robert walker and patricia hitchcock  as the senator s younger daughter  are particularly powerful
