this is a black and white film from france   simple plot  gangster on the run seeking   getting help etc  we have seen this type film many times over the years  what makes this film different are mainly its acting   style  all the actors perform quietly no one yells   hardly anyone loses his temper  there are quite a few deaths  some surprising  there are beautiful women as well  but no sex scenes  no car chases either   just talking  it is so refreshing to listen to people talk    here we must read subtitles as well   the acting is near perfect by all  especially the lead played by   lino ventura   in a smaller but vital role jean paul belmondo  these   actors were among the best   i said above the film is flawed  there are a few script deficiencies in few spots  they are minor the acting is the thing in this movie  production is first rate as well   ratings     out of     points  out of   imdb    out of
