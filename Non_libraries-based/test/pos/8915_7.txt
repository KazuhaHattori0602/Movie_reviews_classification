why do i give this   porn movie   points  because i watched it  and i found it hilarious  aliens  their weird spaceship  their weird helmets  my god  was that a sight  and all what these desperate alien women need is semen from the earth   and where do they look for it  in upper bavaria  germany  and that is where the main fun comes from  in europe  and more so in german speaking countries  bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region  and then the actors are so helpless with the alien women  well  there have been films about people being unable to deal with women like the  american pie  series   but what this film achieved is a true  funny weirdness  you constantly wonder how they came up with these crackpot ideas  but it was   and looking back   years fills one with a kind of nostalgia  you ve never seen a film like that   and if you don t mind seeing the casual pubic hairs and breasts  watch it once  it is a comedy essentially  not a porn flick
