once upon a time  in sweden  there was a poor salvation army sister  at death s door  she requests   send for david holm  but  victor sj str m  as david holm  cannot be located  because he is spending new year s eve in a graveyard  with his drinking buddies  dying sister astrid holm  as edit  wants to see if praying for mr  sj str m s soul  over the past year  has produced any results  arguably  it has not  in the graveyard  sj str m tells the story of  the phantom carriage  which he heard from his dead friend tore svennberg  as georges  according to legend  the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people  until being relieved next new year s eve   director sj str m  whose lead performance is very strong  combines with photographer julius jaenzon to create a visually appealing film  the great  double exposure  effect is used frequently  but never seems overdone  and  it doesn t make the film s other dramatic highlights any less memorable  for example  sj str m s tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door  a selma lagerl f story probably wasn t one you could  or would want to  tamper with in the  s   which may  or may not be  why the ending of this film is a letdown  and  unlike similar spiritual stories  it s difficult to suspend your disbelief  if you think too carefully about what is really happening in  k rkarlen     k rkarlen   victor sj str m   victor sj str m  hilda borgstr m  tore svennberg
