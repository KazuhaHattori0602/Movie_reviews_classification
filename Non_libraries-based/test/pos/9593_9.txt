i think this tv film was first aired the same week that manchester utd played in the champions league final   they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout   it played on all the clich s that are churned out every season during the fa cup ie  plucky underdogs  lucky clothing mascots  name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny   i m surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions  even now with the world cup just getting underway    a few previous posts from non football fans have said they still love it  but a football fan will find it hilarious imho
