i tend to get furious when hearing about lucio fulci s reputation as a director  too often he s categorized as a no talented filmmaker  only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore  true  his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream american production  but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid  don t torture a duckling is yet another story  this film is a pure gem of the italian shock cinema  i easily dare to call this film a masterpiece
it s an old fashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror  the film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small italian mountain town  the bodies of   young boys are found  horribly mutilated  there are quite a lot of pseudo madmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere  among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman  obsessed by witchery and voodoo  like a true mastermind  fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film  he portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings  supported by a giddy soundtrack  fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here  the script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once  in other words  this is a unique giallo  horror slash murder mystery  the gore isn t presented as grotesque and explicit as in lucio s later milestones  among them are the legendary zombie   the beyond and the new york ripper  although there still are a few nauseating and hard to watch shock sequences shown    don t torture a duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement lucio fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest italian horror movies ever made  right next to the masterpieces made by mario bava and dario argento  the film is fascinating from start to finish  some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalin rushing at all times  a must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for italian shock lovers
