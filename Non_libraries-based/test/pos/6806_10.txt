 plete outsider believes in her horse and herself enough to chance a try at the greatest horse race in the world is awe inspiring to any young person  especially a young girl in the  s a time when girls were sometimes ignored as humans beings let alone athletes  you would have to be terribly hard boiled not to appreciate it s merit    but the perspective i cherished most about this movie is the unabridged innocence in it s moral message  it s almost magical how  mom and apple pie  the movies were back then  i was really taken aback by the imdb reviewer who asked was the world ever really this trusting  and then proceeded to chastize the director for his complacency regarding  unchaperoned  overnight travel involving the two main characters  my answer to his question is an unequivocal yes  the movie going world was that trusting in the  s   my grandparents remember taking my mother to this movie when it was released  then my mother took me to see it when i was young  and my daughter was lucky enough to be born at a time when she could watch it repeatedly on video tape  now we have it on dvd  it s been a family favorite for generations  albeit generations of horse lovers  it was never about sex it s about coming of age  it s about believing in yourself and working hard to reach your goals  also  so old fashioned it wasn t even about the prize money  it s about the girl child who understood her horse had what it took to  be the best  and yes  the director was indeed concerned with elizabeth taylor s lack of physical development because the book made a big deal about velvet brown  liz taylor s character  having to cut her hair and bind her chest so that she could pass as a male jockey when she went to the grand national steeplechase  this was a guys only sport back then i think there have only been   women ever to compete in this race  it s almost insulting that anyone would bother to think the lolita thing about this particular movie besides  anyone having had anything at all to do with an adolescent girl and her horse would know that the only thing they ever think about with stars in their eyes have four hooves and a tail   and now for a great bit of trivia the stunt riding was performed by the now famous  horse whisperer  monty roberts  i believe he is given mentioned for his riding in the movie credits   i give this movie a   out of   i never get tired of watching it again
