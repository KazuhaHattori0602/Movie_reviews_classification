when i went to see bon voyage  i expected a good  skillful multidrama on the order of grand hotel   and les enfants de paradis   it was better than that  with few exceptions  none of the characters were totally good or totally evil just as in real life  the acting was wonderful  especially those who played fr d ric  raoul  and camille  the photography was amazing  as it recreated the period perfectly and managed to be shot in around bordeaux during a time of new public works but managed the  look  of june   costumes and make up were accurate  there is so much in this movie that it s worth a second viewing  it s exciting  funny  and  ultimately  touching  n b be sure to see it in a theatre with good quality projection  it s in wide screen  and in the theater where i saw it  the clairmont in montclair  the first   minutes had the subtitles at the bottom in focus but the actors  faces slightly fuzzy  this was ultimately corrected but detracted from the pleasure of the film
