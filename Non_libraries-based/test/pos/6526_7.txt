a   dvd can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off   a decent saturday night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws  special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition  and why does london always look as if it s in the  s    if it had the budget of  say  armageddon then i m sure it would have performed better at the box office as the story is quite a good one   overall  tycus is consigned to b movie history but if you see it for   then it s worth buying
