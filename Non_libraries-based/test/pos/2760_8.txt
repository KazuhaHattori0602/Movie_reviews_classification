graphically  it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for fun   the ps  version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks  the dreamcast version  which is rarely seen anymore  was the best version of the   versions  xbox eventually came out with a  th with  x  it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the ps  and n  could handle   the levels are really amazingly done  from start to finish  like the first one  the school was my favorite  i enjoyed that level so much  not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run you over but for the length  that s what i liked about the first two games  they don t make these games graphically enhanced  they just focused on length of levels  which is cool   overall  just as good as the first one  and well worth playing
