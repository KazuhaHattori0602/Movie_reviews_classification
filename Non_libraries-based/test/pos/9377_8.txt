as a rule  there are few things more dispiriting than hollywood s attempts to be courageous  mixing caution with heavy handedness   message movies  pat themselves loudly on the back for daring to tackle major problems  crossfire is not entirely free from this taint  it includes a sermon on the nature of senseless hatred that is embarrassingly obvious  assuming a level of naivity in its audience that s depressing to contemplate  as late as   it was a big deal for a movie to announce that anti semitism existed  and that it was bad   it was unthinkable  of course  for hollywood to address the real subject of the book on which the movie was based its victim was a homosexual  nevertheless  thanks to good writing and excellent acting  crossfire remains a persuasive examination of what we would now call a hate crime   postwar malaise was one of the major components of film noir  and crossfire addresses it directly  the film is set in washington  d c  among soldiers still in uniform but idle  spending their days playing poker and bar crawling  joseph samuels  sam levene  an intelligent and kindly jew  explains that the end of the war has created a void  all the energy that went into hating and fighting the enemy is now unfocused and bottled up  samuels meets three soldiers in a bar  the sensitive mitchell  who is close to a nervous breakdown  the weak willed floyd bowers  and montgomery  a tall  overbearing bully who nastily belittles a young soldier from tennessee as a stupid hillbilly  the three soldiers wind up at samuels  apartment  where the drunken monty becomes increasingly abusive  calling his host  jew boy  samuels is beaten to death  and mitchell disappears  making himself the prime suspect for the killing   unraveling the crime are detective finlay  robert young  dry and by the book  and sergeant keeley  robert mitchum  a thoughtful and experienced friend who knows mitchell is incapable of murder  among the pieces of the puzzle are ginny  gloria grahame  a nightclub hostess who met mitchell and gave him her apartment key  and floyd  steve brodie  who as a witness to the crime holes up terrified in a seedy rooming house  while there is no real  whodunit  suspense  the story remains gripping  and the trap laid for the killer is extremely clever   the strong noir atmosphere saves the movie from feeling didactic or sanctimonious  the cinematography is a striking shadow play  with inky darks and harsh lights  rooms often lit by a single lamp filtered by cigarette smoke  world weariness is as pervasive as noir lighting   nothing interests me  finlay says quietly   to nothing  is ginny s toast in the nightclub  gloria grahame  the paragon of noir femininity  nearly steals the movie with her two scenes  platinum blonde  jaded and caustic  she s the quintessential b girl  poisoned by the  stinking gin mill  where she works  for laughs  she says bitterly  her sweet face curdling when mitchell tells her that she reminds him of his wife  now and then a wistful kindness peeks through her defensive shell  as when she dances with mitchell in a deserted courtyard  then offers to cook him spaghetti at her apartment  when he goes there  he meets a weasely  crumple faced man  paul kelly  who seems to sponge off ginny  and whose conversation is a dense layering of lies and false confessions  gloria blows mitchell s good girl wife off the screen in a scene where she s asked to give mitchell an alibi  slim and frail in her bathrobe  with her girlish lisp  she lets us see just how often ginny has been insulted and dismissed as a tramp   robert young is a nondescript actor  and he stands no chance against mitchum s charisma  but he does a good job of keeping his pipe smoking character  saddled with delivering the movie s earnest message  this side of pompousness  mitchum  meanwhile  gets some cool dialogue  but not nearly enough to do  still  even when he s doing nothing but lounging in a corner you can t take your eyes off him  the third robert  ryan  creates a fully shaded and frighteningly convincing portrait of an ignorant  unstable bigot  we see his phony geniality  his bullying  his resentment of anyone with advantages  his  am i right or am i right  smugness  how easily he slaps labels on people and what satisfaction he gets from despising them   crossfire s message seems cautious and dated now  though not nearly so much as the same year s a gentleman s agreement  finlay s speech about bigotry cops out by reaching back a hundred years for an instance of white victimhood  reminding us that irish catholics were once persecuted  next it could be people from tennessee  he says  or men who wear striped neckties  or maybe blacks  or japanese  or homosexuals  or communists  the script seems afraid to mention any real contemporary problems  it sweetens its message by making the jewish victim saintly  as though his innocence were not sufficient  and it takes care to exonerate the military  having a superior officer declare that the army is ashamed of men like montgomery  and stressing that samuels served honorably in the war  still  it did take some guts to depict  immediately after world war ii  an american who might have been happier in the nazi army  and the movie s basic premise is still valid  if monty were alive today  he would have gone out on september     and beat up a sikh
