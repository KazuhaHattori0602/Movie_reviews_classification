the second in director cohen s trilogy of second world war comedies  the others being  till death do us part  and `adolf hitler   my part in his downfall  is a film version of the bbc s long running  and much loved  situation comedy  like most transfers of television shows  this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches  some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable  surreal moment   the joy of this movie is it s representation of a past that probably never existed and an england which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene stealers such as john le mesurier given their biggest film roles  arthur lowe is superb as captain mainwaring  a bungler  who  when the chips are down  displays great courage and saves the day  the climax is probably the character s greatest moment   episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a british legend  you cannot find anything better
