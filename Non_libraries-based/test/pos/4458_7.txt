if you like who dun its  you will like this film  considered the best italian detective story  giallo  fulci has done   it s not mickey spillane for sure  there are scenes designed to disturb anyone   many would be offended by a local beauty trying to seduce a  year old boy  she was joking  but she was naked nonetheless  and he would have jumped at the chance to jump her bones  she also tries to tempt the local priest   young boys are turning up missing  and there are several interesting suspects  you have to watch carefully to discover the killer  can you  don t jump on the first guy  it s way too early  and he is too obvious   anyone familiar with fulci will be able to guess the killer  who died a violent death at the end  what crazy reasoning he had
