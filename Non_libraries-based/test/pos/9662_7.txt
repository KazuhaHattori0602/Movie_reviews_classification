i have to say that i haven t expected that this movie to be this good  usually  the eastern cinema presents the communist past in   of the films  however  this film surpasses the romanian cinema  being worthy of some more advertisement    the acting is truthfully and not exaggerated  the plot is simple yet complex as it presents the life in the romanian suburbia  the sound amazed me  the directing was good and what more can i say    this  crash  of eastern europe was drawn me into the film living each moment of it  i have even felt a desire coming out of me  a desire for adventure after seeing it   watch it  you will definitely enjoy it
