this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre  set in rural italy  there is a serial killer of children at large  add to the mix an array of characters familiar to fans of giallo cinema   a madwoman  a newspaper reporter  ineffectual police  a sexy siren  a priest  a mute girl  a mentally retarded loner etc  this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early  s   unusually for a giallo  the victims in this case are young boys  which makes a change from the more typical women in peril angle  the fact that it is kids who are the target of the maniac only serves to make things a little more uncomfortable  fulci is pushing the envelope a bit here and he goes even further in a gloriously outrageous unpc scene where a young boy is subjected to the somewhat inappropriate attention of a sexy naked young woman  barbara bouchet  who he is tasked with delivering a drink to  she displays herself openly and actively invites the youngster to ogle her  ultimately asking him if he wants to go to bed with her  although she is clearly playing around with him  it s still quite an unusual scene  admittedly there are one or two unintentionally funny bits of dialogue here but it s very nicely photographed and barbara bouchet exudes high levels of confident sex appeal  a standout scene  even if you might feel slightly wrong watching it   along with barbara bouchet  the other standout performance is from florinda bolkan  who plays a madwoman who is accused of murdering the children  she is not directly responsible but it is left to the viewer to decide whether her black magic may or may not have kicked off the subsequent killing spree  irrespective  she is hunted down by a lynch mob and chain whipped while a car radio blasts out rock music  this scene is very strong and unpleasant  its viciousness indicates the path fulci s career would subsequently go   despite the visceral impact of the above murder it s maybe a little surprising that the other killings are either bloodless or committed off screen  the only other death scene comparable with the lynch mob is the demise of the killer at the end of the movie  although this sequence is kind of silly  the plot is convoluted and awash with red herrings  although personally  i found the identity of the killer a little predictable  this weakness is less problematic on subsequent viewings though   like most gialli  don t torture a duckling is eminently re watchable   technically  the film is well made with impressive camera work  solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani   particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it s coming from a distant hill  fulci obviously went on to make more graphically violent horror movies but here he shows a talent for slightly more restrained material  it s still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema
