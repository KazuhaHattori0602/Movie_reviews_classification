  building on his previous success with happy together and chungking express  wong kar wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions  yearning and unrequited love    possibly  in the mood for love is not to everyone s taste  it wanders in rather lazily at  mins  not particularly long for a film  but it appears longer because not a lot really happens  but this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film  most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays  where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses  trying to work out how the affair started  i say cunning because  of course  this makes it difficult for the audience  and the characters  to tell what is  in role  and what is genuine    if all this sounds rather arty and self conscience  that s because it is  unashamedly so  and it is played to perfection by two of hong kong s finest  maggie cheung and leung chui wai  with some excellent support from ping lam siu and rebecca pan   it is also a virtuoso performance by wong kar wai  who treats the audience to a sensory  and sensual  overload  bringing together christopher doyle  who later deployed his lush  over ripe style on hero  and pin bing lee  whose beautifully understated style can be seen on springtime in a small town  was cinematographic genius  it has all the bold beauty of doyle  without  frankly  the athena poster cheesiness of his work on hero  the music  as always with wong  is prominent  from nat king cole singing in spanish  to the haunting strings of the main theme  it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images    all in all a top film  whether judged on plot  acting  cinematography or soundtrack  similar to  but more accessible than  wim wenders  wings of desire  this is a beautiful  old fashioned story about love lost and regained    and watch out for tony leung s hotel room   which presaged wong s recent film of the same name
