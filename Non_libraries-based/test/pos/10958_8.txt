seven months since a revelatory viewing of faces  i finally found a rentable dvd copy of cassavetes  first feature  shot on a shoestring in manhattan and in his acting workshop on ad hoc sets  shadows was the culmination of months of improvisational rehearsals  in which the  mostly amateur  actors developed bonds with one another  invented their characters  and polished their techniques to give their filmed performances just the right tenor of spontaneous familiarity  this intimate approach led to some incredibly daring work in faces i e  seymour cassel cramming his hands down lynn carlin s throat in an attempt to revive her from an overdose just as the actors  utter conviction here yields blisteringly honest moments like lelia and tony s post coital assessment of their relationship and ben s revulsion at a black woman s touch as a manifestation of his racial confusion and self loathing  a homemade production in the best sense  the out of sync dubbing and sound recording  and the granular cinematography and up close camera setups  build an immersive atmosphere that perfectly suits cassavetes  nuanced vision of human relationships as perpetual works in progress  marked by desperate emotional fluctuations and wistful attempts at communication and understanding  charles mingus s largely improvised jazz score is an ideal complement to the film s vision of living by the moment  a mantra by which cassavetes worked and seemingly lived
