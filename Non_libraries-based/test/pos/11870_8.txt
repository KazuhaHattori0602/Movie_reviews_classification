liv tyler  liv tyler  liv tyler  yeah it s hard to keep your mind off this fetching beauty  giving an radiantly picture perfect performance  as she simply has tongues wagging   one night at mccool s  is a dementedly quirky and raunchy black comedy with old fashion shades tied in to its familiar  but smartly crafted and chaotic narrative which has three men lusting after the one women and she s milking it to her advantage  when you see tyler  no wonder why they are infatuated and would do anything
 that s anything to see  her  happy and living  her  dreams  just like tyler  there s something rather intoxicating about this feature in that we see the likes of matt dillon  john goodman  paul reiser  who s great  and especially michael douglas  who plays the hired assassin with cool ease  but a questionable hairdo  really having a good time with their roles  the consuming plot opens up with the main three characters  dillon  goodman and reiser  telling their story of how they came to encounter this divine presence and the eventual affects that she s having on them to lead to an insane climax  there s an unpredictable chain of events  ranging from fruity to sensual  where everything would virtually tie in together with a certain ironic  snowball  twist of fate for the characters  that see them leaving their reserved comfort zone to fulfill this girl  howard zwart s direction is colorfully zippy balancing the script s quick fire gags and frenetically fun  if complicated situations  one of the best under the radar comedies in the last decade  which will have you under tyler s thumb
