this relic from before the days of the production code and the hays office is good fun  not great but entertaining   based on a song by rogers   hart that was an enormous hit at the time  the story revolves around dance hall girl barbara stanwyck who is romanced by wealthy businessman ricardo cortez  who was indecently handsome  but whose heart belongs to her bookish neighbor monroe owsley  she and owsley marry  but keep it a secret  while she dismisses cortez  who still holds out hope  she helps hubby get a job in cortez s company  but married bliss quickly turns sour as owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps out with a college sweetheart and gambles in high stakes bridge  yup  i know  it s pretty funny  finally he embezzles   from cortez  and is about to go on the lam  when his devoted wife goes to cortez and i won t reveal anything else  although the ending was certainly a surprise   stanwyck is the best thing about this movie  in one of her earliest roles she s quite accomplished  owsley is the weak point  he s unattractive and sniveling  while cortez is amazingly suave and sexy  while his performance is earnest but unremarkable   while ostensibly a drama  it s filled with laughs  many inadvertant as some elements of this movie have aged very poorly  but there are a lot of good witty lines  at one point stanwyck says to cortez   my brains are in my feet  while yours are in  that s pretty darn suggestive for   there s a lot of bawdy and suggestive stuff in this flick  in the last days before the code clamped down and whitewashed everything  an amusing antique  a good reminder of how far we haven t come in   years this story could very easily be changed to fit   but could keep the basic plot  with the original ending  in place
