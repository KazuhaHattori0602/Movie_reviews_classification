this movie has been a favorite of mine and is entwined with the christmas holidays for me for two reasons    growing up in the  s  everything was space related from advertising to television programs and even santa claus found himself in spaceships during that era  and   i saw this movie during a christmas shopping trip when i was ten years old and it brought back fond memories of my favorite tv shows when i was even younger  supercar  fireball xl  and  stingray  therefore  i am a tad biased when it comes to this movie for personal reasons   that said  as a long time student of film  this is mainly a movie for fans of gerry anderson  and barry gray  oh  that gorgeous score  whereas the casual movie watcher will be put off by the future vision from the past  dig those wild cars  commercial aircraft  clothes  etc  and the so called  plot twist  which will cause some to groan  however  if you can look past the post  a space odyssey  desire to make a science fiction film with a  far out  story line  and if you enjoy imaginative special effects  then you will enjoy this gem from an era when man had just walked on the moon and people were still looking up at the stars in wonder and hope for the future rather than looking down at the banal trappings of the actual  st century
