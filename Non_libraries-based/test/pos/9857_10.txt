one has to be careful whom one tells about watching  hour long films  it could become easy for people to assume that this is some kind of regular occurrence   in fact  even in the world of  arthouse  cinema  such mammoth running times are extremely rare  for obvious reasons  this is one thing that hollywood and art cinema share in common  the generally accepted running time of   minutes  with a minority of movies that dare to approach  but rarely exceed  the three hour mark   for this reason  a film like out    runtime    minutes  is a challenge for even the most hardened cinephile  and it goes some way in explaining why it has only ever been screened on a handful of occasions and remains extremely hard to find   originally devised as a tv series by maverick nouvelle vague director jacques rivette  it raised little interest from the french networks  and wound up being given a brief theatrical run instead  peter watkins was forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo  documentary the war game  although that had more to do with state censorship than issues with running time  shown a couple of times in   out   has re emerged at a handful of rivette retrospectives over the last two decades  and many who have seen it  including esteemed us critic jonathan rosenbaum  have acclaimed it as one of the greatest films of all time   is it  well  yes  if you like rivette  that alone is a big  if  as jacques rivette has never been a commercially successful director  only two of his films were hits  celine and julie go boating   and la belle noiseuse   both superb  and many remain difficult to find on dvd today  out   only recently became available over the internet after a rare videotape was uploaded  nevertheless  he is greatly respected within the film community  and with good reason   his playfully surreal narratives  sense of pacing and use of improvisation set him apart as one of cinema s most unique and satisfying film makers   out   deals with a theme that re occurs throughout rivette s work  the nature of acting  particularly in the context of theatre and improvisation  his fascination with acting make rivette s films a far more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries  as the improvisational aspects allow actors to have a far more active role in determining how the film comes together  out   is roughly divided into four major narratives  gradually intertwining and blurring as the film develops  two consisting of acting troupes  each trying to devise post modern theatrical adaptations of aeschylus plays  the other two individual petty thieves  played by nouvelle vague icons jean pierre l aud and juliet berto  pursuing eccentric methods of making money  and an overarching plot involving a mysterious balzac inspired conspiracy centred around an organisation known as  the thirteen   as with any rivette film featuring a  conspiracy  narrative  the mysteries and secret organisations are little more than a red herring  as the characters are slowly explored and revealed and their plans and interpersonal connections break down  the film becomes increasingly symbolic of post  ennui and the decline of the ideals of that era  for a film made in   these were remarkably prescient themes  another french director in jean eustache would tackle this topic equally satisfyingly in his   masterpiece the mother and the whore  but this is not the limit of out  s scope    comprised of eight episodes of roughly   minutes each  the beginning of each episode has a brief  abstract black and white still montage of the events of the previous chapter  out   is no less watchable than any quality tv series  and may even be better experienced on a one episode  at a time basis  this is not to say that it doesn t remain challenging even when viewed in segments  like most rivette films  it uses the first few hours to simply establish the characters before embarking on the plot  of sorts  and some of those early scenes  particularly the sequences depicting the actors  heavily abstracted  exercises  seem interminably long  these scenes are important  however  not just as an exploration of the improvisational acting methods that play both a literal and a metaphorical role in the film  but as a method of adjusting the viewer to the somewhat languorous pace of the film  paradoxically  long takes make long films far more tolerable for an audience  and this understanding of pacing has led rivette  along with more modern directors like michael haneke and b la tarr  to create films with less commercial running times that nevertheless retain the capacity to leave viewers enthralled   in a film that is in many ways about acting  the acting is fantastic  many famous nouvelle vague faces appear  including the aforementioned l aud and berto  the outstanding michel lonsdale and rivette regular bulle ogier  even another legendary director in eric rohmer has a great cameo as a balzac professor who appears in a pivotal scene  the people and architecture of paris c    though  seem to have an equally significant role   the city landscapes  crowd scenes and interested onlookers freeze out   in time  a document of a place at a point in history   after a little more than   minutes  the film ends on an impossibly brief  enigmatic note  yet  the exhausting journey that the viewer has taken is so full of possibilities  intricacy and spontaneity  that one would be forgiven for wanting to start all over again from the beginning  or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters  for those who have watched many kinds of cinema and think they have seen everything the art form has to offer  out   is a reminder that cinema has the potential to be so many more things and diverge in so many more directions than current conventions allow  for film makers  film critics and artists of all disciplines  this is something to be cherished
