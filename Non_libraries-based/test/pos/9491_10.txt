i bought my first zep album in    at   and have been hooked ever since  this dvd has now taken pride of place in my music collection  it is not often that a band can boast   virtuosos in their lineup but here we can  each member made their own contribution to the band but on the stage together  the electricity they generated was bigger than the   individuals  this masterpiece covers the band s entire career from led zep   to coda and this is captured magnificently on this dvd as each concert shows how the band became bigger and bigger over the years  recently my copy disappeared  but i m happy to say was found in my  yo son s room as the new generation discover just how great these guys were  this is a must have for anyone who has an appreciation of rock music  long live led zeppelin
