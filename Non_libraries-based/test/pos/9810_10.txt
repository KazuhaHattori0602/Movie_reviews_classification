spoiler nothing but spoiler  i have to add my name to the list of folks who feel that the other viewers just don t get it  but no one has even mentioned the  s  word so far as i have seen   while i agree that the kid died i think we can be more specific  he committed suicide  he races down the slope in an old wagon  shoots off the cliff and flies away  maybe the whole account of the form of death is allegory or maybe he does commit suicide in a wagon as laid out  in either case  he  flies away   c mon  not that tough a metaphor   maybe i just have a thing for tom hanks  but i was ok with the narration  besides he is raising   for the ww  memorial and you gotta love him for that   oh yeah  i loved the movie and found it incredibly moving
