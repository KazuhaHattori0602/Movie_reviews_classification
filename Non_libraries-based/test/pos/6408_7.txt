compared to this  tarkovsky is a speed freak   compared to this  bela tarr is mtv   compared to this  the movie  russian ark  is a roller coaster ride   i ve just described   of the sllllo wwesssstttt experiences i ve ever known  and this one tops them all  but that s not saying it s bad  on the contrary  i really liked it  but it was a chore   i won t describe the plot  because you can easily find that elsewhere  suffice it to say that the plot is insane  it s one of the most creative and bizarre ideas since  becoming john malkovich  i believe the interesting plot is the main reason i kept from nodding off  also  the humour was nice  that s something we rarely see in slow  artsy films   here we see a bizarre reversal of the norm  most movies have little plot   little substance  yet they fill   mins with a lot of eyecatching images to keep us enthralled  but  the hole  has   plot theme without much to please the eyes  in that respect  i suppose it s a truly intellectual experience  much like reading a painfully verbose novel like thackaray s  vanity fair   which i ve never been able to finish   if you have a tremendous attention span  i think you ll really like this film  despite its molassessy pace  it s highly creative and imaginative  it s like jean pierre jeunet on quaaludes and with a drab  dusty camera lens  best of luck
