if you don t like mel brooks  you won t like this film  that s a given  why anyone wouldn t like his films is unknown to me  but for those who can t see the light  just avoid it   everyone else  this is a classic  the entire cast is perfect  carey elwes is a dashing  clever  british robin hood  amy yasbeck overacts appropriately as marion  richard lewis is his usual distracted  annoyed self  roger rees is a brilliant combination of fluster and violence as  mervyn  the sheriff of rottingham  and dave chapelle  eric allan kramer  mark blankfield  and the sadly underused matthew poretta are the perfect merry men   there are similarities to spaceballs  blazing saddles and every other mel brooks movie  but why would you want him to change his style when it works so damn well  the pop culture references in this movie are old enough to be funny again from the view of a   year old  at least  it s complete and utter parody  every second a play for a laugh  some of them don t work  but most do  and well  i discovered new jokes the fifth and sixth time i watched the film   of course  if being barraged by constant visual and verbal gags isn t your style  you wouldn t like this  this isn t an academy award winner  it s mel brooks  you know what it is when you re getting into it  if you want nonstop laughter  surprisingly well developed characters  and catchphrases to last a lifetime  watch this
