the  s saw a rise and fall of what we have come to know as  blacksploitation  films  the term is a reference to kind of broad catch all  rather than a true genre of film  in short  any comedy  drama  adventure  western or urban cops   robbers shoot em up  that are so constructed and so cast as to appeal to the large urban black population of the mid  th century  that indeed could embrace the widest type of films  as long as the had a slant toward the inner city black population   it appears that the idea of producing these films of particularly keen interest to black americans had its genesis with the eastertime release of   rifles  marvin schwartz prod th century fox    in it  former syracuse university all american footballer and several times all pro fullback for the cleveland browns  jim brown  had a co starring billing  having appeared in a number of films already  as for example  rio conchos  the dirty dozen    ice sttion zebra   and others  it was beginning to make more sense to the studios   suits  that jim was a hot property   now this   rifles brings record numbers of black patrons to the big cities  central business districts on easter sunday to view mr  brown  why not start to film more of these adventure epics and other types of film with more black players and stars  why not  indeed  so we saw a succession of cops   robbers  bad ass private detective films  comedies  all going the route  along the way  we eventually got to some more family oriented  wider appealing films  the movie goers were treated to sounder   the take   conrack  and  ultimately  claudine    in claudine  we find no stigma nor easy classification as being  blackploitation  as the story is universal  and could easily have been done as a story about people of any descent  any where  and not just in the  s usa   that the story was done of a single mother  claudine  dianne carroll  struggling to keep a family together after  two marriages and two almost marriages  is a far cry from a shoot em up harlem style  the problems that plague the everyday citizens of our nation are confronted and examined under the ol  sociological microscope   but we also consider claudine s psychological and physical needs as a female  for  woman needs man and man must have his mate and we do concede this point   that s s e x that we re talking about  schultz  claudine meets up with a very masculine  broad shouldered  athletic type in private scavanger garbage man  ruppert b  marshall  james earl jones  and they go on a date   the great welfare state intervenes with the couple as claudine s welfare case worker  miss tayback  elisa loti  comes snooping around to see just who is this unattached male  who is suddenly paying so much attention to claudine s family   after a humiliating experience with the welfare bureau s auditing and  deducting  binge  which would be the norm for the family  the two decide to get married with or without the blessing of big brother   meanwhile  claudine s elder son has gotten involved with some big talking but little doing black activist group  but  with ruppert s help  he and they all come through it a o k   it ends on a happy  upbeat and hopeful note  we know that it may not be exactly  happily ever after  but rather the ll make it all together  if there is a single criticism that we must state it is that sometimes in a movie like this  a misconception is spread to a large portion of urban blacks  and that is  the apparent implied myth that all whites are wealthy  having none of their kind ever in need of a helping hand  out of work or suffering any disabilities   well  folks  it just ain t true  note    at one point  jim brown s career was a real hit as a rugged actioner  he was even being tauted as  the black john wayne  note    the idea of producing films with all black casts  filmed for all black consumption was not a new idea  in the  s   s and  s  we saw productions from people like noble johnson  spencer williams  jr  and rex ingram   note    that s  as time goes by  you know  schultz  it s from casablanca  warner brothers
