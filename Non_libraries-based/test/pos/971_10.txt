i love this movie    yes  the main character lies  but that s why it s called  big fat liar  even though this kid runs away to hollywood  it doesn t give kids the idea that they can  besides  he doesn t just do it for fun or to get away from anything  he does it to regain trust    i don t think it was just one big ad for universal studios  because i liked how it gave an inside view of what it s like for kids who don t know how cool movie making is    it has good music and fun characters  this family comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike  it has humour  excitement  and real life difficulties like lying   in the end   big fat liar  sends out a moral  don t expect lying to be easy
