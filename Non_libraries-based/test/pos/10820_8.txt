i think that the costumes were excellent  and the hairdressers also performed well  it has the very authentic feeling for that period of time   i don t know if it was the computer magic or if it was real  some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background  i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridge   the main character the actress also performed well  she showed us a nervous  witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wants   some of the scenes were hilarious  even though it was about   hours long  but it was never boring  a very good entertaining movie
