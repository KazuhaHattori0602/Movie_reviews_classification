i  too  found  oppenheimer  to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on american pbs  david suchet was particularly effective as edward teller  as i recall  and the overall conception was spectacularly good  the only reason that the series doesn t rate a full   is for the low budget production values in some areas  actual content is absolutely first rate in my recollection   the oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the uk on july  st  it will be a region  pal set  but it would seem that a region  ntsc set should be soon in the offing   if you have a universal player in the us  you can order the series right now from amazon uk       huzzah
