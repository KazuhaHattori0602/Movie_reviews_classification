this is in short the tv comedy series with the best cast ever and the most likable also each one of them is a first hand comedy actor i know only one tv series which was better  i e   moonlighting that one had willis as a lead yet it had willis only while the king of queens has a pocketful of actors that are as fine as one can enjoy kevin james  leah remini  jerry stiller  patton oswalt  nicole sullivan  victor williams  gary valentine and even all the rest of them 
 i spontaneously and continually and promptly liked it advancing age didn t spoil the fun anyway   in a few words the series is intelligent and original miraculously spared of the current tv stupidity and garbage  it is politically incorrect and doesn t court the minorities in the usual disgusting way   the comic is very palatable and savory   i read  mostly approvingly  a few imdb writers  and sometimes they write about their favorite shows yet  though these writers are several  i did not encountered  at any of them  the slightest mention of my favorite tv shows  but it s true that the critics one likes are not those with whom he finds himself in complete approval but those who at least offer a common basis for disapproval which are  mainly  wild wild west  moonlighting  queens  fantomas  the  s twilight zone  bradbury s tv show and sandokan  most of them i have seen when i was   yrs  about a few of them i have written  and execrably
