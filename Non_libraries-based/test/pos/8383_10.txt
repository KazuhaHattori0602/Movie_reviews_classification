i must admit when i saw the preview for  inglorious basterds  i gave myself big expectations  this film did not disappoint   rarely when i watch a movie with such high expectations do i have those expectations met or exceeded  this film did that and more  even more rarely do i clap at the end of a movie  this i and everyone else in the theater did   i have to say i am a little biased towards quentin  i grew up with  pulp fiction  i watched it when i was   and it is still my favorite and most influential film   however  since then quentin has not really lived up to his billing  his style was getting a little predictable instead of familiar  the quality honestly wasn t there  i never watched jackie brown  and then there s grindhouse  that is until  inglorious basterds  what quentin did was exactly what was needed for the war genre  a spaghetti western feel that could only be done by tarantino or sergio leone  but seeing how leone is dead  tarantino s the self appointed guy on this masterpiece   so let s look at the movie which i won t give away  the writing was spot on  a beautiful transition between using not one but four different languages in this movie  not to mention this movie was set up in the classic tarantino mold  great scenes of rich meaningful dialog and sudden shocking action   the acting was superb  christopher waltz deserves an oscar  seriously  i don t say that often  but honestly the man should get one for this movie  he spoke every language in this movie  and delivered with such amazing touch and poise  he stole the show in a movie that everybody was amazingly impressive   i have no problem building this movie up  because this movie is the best film i ve seen all year  and probably all of next year  quite frankly the more i think about it  this movie may crack my top films of all time  and is quentin s best movie since  pulp fiction  take it from me  watch this film  i loved it doesn t do this movie enough justice   i watched it yesterday and i m still blown away  thank you quentin from the bottom of my heart for you making this movie  you re back on top again buddy  i can t say enough for  inglorious basterds
