i picked up a dvd at the   discount  having no idea what it s about  but at that price i can t resist  in brief  i was positively surprised   so much that i did quite some research  on the german dvd  part   of a series of   episodes were recombined into two   minute parts  and out of order  here are my results  based on wikipedia s episode list    doomsday  is in my boots   the voice  final episode     war of the machines  is hel   high water       pod listener   juggernaut down   well  what can i say  underdressed girlies are of course interesting for older men  i never watched charlie s angels so much  so i can t compare  but the more i watched  the less i looked out for bikini tops and their fillings  instead  the characters  both m and f  became more interesting  i can imagine feminists have their fun with this  too  all in all  maybe a guilty pleasure  but a pleasure it was  ^
