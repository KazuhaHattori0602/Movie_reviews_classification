i have seen  the sea within  today and i loved it  the actors of the movie are wonderful  specially javier bardem  of course  but i thought that bel n rueda would have a better role  lola due as  clara segura and  specially  mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations  and i cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau  brother and father of the protagonist   there are two technical aspects i loved very much  aguirresarobe s photography and the score by amen bar himself  i liked the song   negra sombra   dark shadow  by luz casal with music of carlos n ez   in short  i think that the spanish academy should choose  the sea within  in order to compete in the oscar awards  i liked other spanish productions  such as almod var s  bad education  but amen bar s film is much better than them   the sea within  deserves all the awards
