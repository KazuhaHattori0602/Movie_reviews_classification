let s face it   this movie is incredibly clich  as korean romance dramas and movies go  first of all  there s a pair of long lost siblings  one of which falls in love with the other  second  there s a not so popular girl and two gorgeous  popular guys who fall for and fight over her  third  one of the characters suffers from a tragic disease  which  eventually  takes his life   still  i like this movie   without the right actors  this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel  but because the actors fit the roles perfectly  the movie is engrossing i honestly couldn t stop watching  kang dong won  despite his pretty face  gives an awesome  heartrending performance  not to mention lee chung ah and jo han sun  plus all the supporting actors   i d definitely recommend this movie to everyone
