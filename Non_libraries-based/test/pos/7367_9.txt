campfire tales    an excellent peace of work  everything about this film is just perfect   the film has a great cast as you can see from imdb  the reason i brought the film was because of christine taylor and the love for horror films  lets get to the main parts    there are   teenagers in this film   after crashing their car they decide to tell some spooky stories   there are   stories and the main plot   the   teenagers are the main plot    the best story is   people can lick too in my opinion  the least scary story is possibly  honeymoon  or the  nd story  can t remember the name      people can lick too  is about a man pretending to be a   year old girl  over the internet  he starts chatting to a girl called amanda and then enters her house   very creepy stuff this story will make you think twice of chatting to someone online  basically a pervert enters her house and things go creepy     the main plot is sweet and simple  teenagers crash  tell stories  try to freak each other out  but there s a very cool twist at the end   the only bad part of this movie is  the teenagers crash their car into another couple  but the kids don t bother seeing if the couple are ok  they just talk about the couple who they ve crashed into   the men and women who made this film made it to scare people  not to make money  unlike  scream  and  i know what you did last summer  this film is created to scare you   scream  and  i know what you did last summer  were made to make big time cash   even though this movie wasn t pushed as publicly as scream was   it s still   times better than scream and  i know what you did last summer   the characters in this movie are great and have realistic characteristics  the cast who play theses characters are great  christine taylor does a fabulous job with lauren  doesn t go over the top with the acting  the dude who plays eric  laurens younger brother  also does a good job of showing men or teenage boys can also get freaked out  screams is like a spoof movie  the murderer is a joke and the kids are dumb   unlike scream and  i know what you did last summer  this movie has realistic people  not a goof of a movie  should of been more noticed
