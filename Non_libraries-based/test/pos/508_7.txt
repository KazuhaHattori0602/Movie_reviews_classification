 blade  would be an extremely above average comic book  vampire hunter action horror if it weren t for two minor flaws    i loved seeing the all but invincible blade snipes do his slicing and dicing  but the whole  yes  fist punch was literally a letdown    bad  no make that horrible  cgi   even for   standards  this is mainly in the last third  but some sprinkled throughout  okay  despite those minor infractions  i really enjoyed this movie  all actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another  matrix  rip off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior  so maybe  the matrix  copied  blade  at any rate  it s a very movie for multiple genre loving audiences  comic book geeks  action fanatics and horror vampire lovers  so  we have blade  half man half vampire  or  day walker  and his accomplish  whisler  a la  batman and alfred  battling the undead who  apparently almost out number humans  who knew  in a rare act of humanity  blade s more of an antihero  our sword ninja vamp rescues a newly infected  coincidentally  blood specialist doctor  meanwhile  trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants  you guessed it  supreme power and needs blade somehow to obtain it  it s not the most original concept  if you read what i just wrote  but still highly enjoyable  you will want to see blade succeed  you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms  and you will know what s coming as this is the typical act   of a comic book introduction movie  still  watch this without trying to go too deep  such as vampire spf   suntan lotion  really  what about the scalp  wouldn t that still burn  just like the money they burn for weapons  uh  okay  i am going too deep  once again  sit back and enjoy the techno charged fun ride
