despite the apparent structural similarity with the simpsons   loud fat dad  housewifey mum    children  a pet  typical suburban home  family guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to the simpsons  its avid use  and sometimes too much  of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season  while some hit the nail on the head  the rhea perlman and danny devito bit in season   is spine snappingly hilarious  others are less successful  coming across as contrived  and they can be annoying  especially when they don t advance the story line   the jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting   the chemistry between stewie and brian griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold  so much so that chris and meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family   however  the feature film stewie griffin  the untold story  is mindnumbingly horrible  thank goodness it went straight to dvd   contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial simpsons  seth macfarlane s approach with family guy is actually very different   it s much more politically incorrect  and amazingly  a lot more brazen   creator of ren and stimpy  john kricfalusi  famously criticized family guy for having  extremely low  graphic standards from a cartoonist s standpoint  i don t think it looks that bad though  the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful   all in all  a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes
