okay  i think we re all agreed that michael jackson was the low point   and the special effects too  but  please  keep in mind that this was not a big budget film  okay  not every film gets as much of a budget as harry potter or star wars   however  i thought it was pretty funny altogether  b  nothing that would  in my opinion  waste your time   parodies are always fun to watch  and just because it wasn t big budget doesn t mean it s bad   i think this was a good movie  if weak at some points   hope this comment helps   angela
