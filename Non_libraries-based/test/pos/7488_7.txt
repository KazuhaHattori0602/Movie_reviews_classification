a vehemently cynical  sarcastic and intense film  mocking and imitating the style of pulp fiction and stylized gangster films  thursday is an entertaining  off putting and hilarious thrill ride  an amazingly eclectic mix of over the top characters and bizarrely entertaining situations  this day in the life of a gunman trying to go straight proves to be a worthy addition to the series of films that attempts to mimic the genius of tarantino s dark humored masterpiece pulp fiction   nick  aaron eckhardt  stops by casey s  thomas jane  house to catch up on old times  casey was a former gunman for drug dealers who has since reformed  become an architect  married a successful businesswoman  paula marshall  and is now contemplating adopting a child  nick  who still has ties to the gangster underworld  leaves a briefcase full of drugs at casey s house while he borrows his car to run a few errands
 a k a  unfinished business  disgusted and angered by the introduction of drugs into his home  casey flushes them all down the kitchen sink  that s when  one at a time  nick s double crossed accomplices  rapping rastafarian drug messengers  and crooked cops all come a knocking for the unsuspecting casey  who is about to have one unbelievable thursday   the film opens with a hilarious sequence in a gas station in which nick is looking for the best deal for a cup of coffee  after pondering which size cup to get  a fiasco breaks out with the cashier when he demands a free snackie cake and uses a   bill to pay  resulting in comically brilliant bloodshed  the situation goes from bad to worse when a cop intervenes and is caught in the most unusual of circumstances  this opening segment establishes the perfect mood for the rest of the film  which never takes itself too seriously and includes outrageous characters that seem self aware of their own existence in this nonsensical gangster flick   the film is broken into segments based on various events and times during the course of one day  this effect is much like pulp fiction  which is a similarly given chapters  although thursday doesn t mess with chronological order except for the occasional flashback  also like tarantino  music magnificently introduces each scene and each character  oddly humorous creatures  such as the jamaican hit man pizza delivery guy that raps over the phone and shares his hashish  and paulina porizkova s narcissistic dallas  who attempts to rape casey  add humor to each event regardless of how horrifying and unnerving some of the coincidences are  when mickey rourke s calmly spine chilling crooked cop kasarov is introduced  the careful staging and intricate setup is fully assembled  and casey s sticky situation becomes even more daring and laudable   definitely a wannabe pulp fiction  with plenty of violence  witty dialogue and extremely creepy antagonists  thursday does some things right  but other attempts at homage may be going just far enough as to suggest rip off  a flashback sequence that shows casey shooting up baddies and sporting a hairstyle that exactly matches john travolta s do in pulp fiction is easily one step too far     mike massie    moviepulse net
