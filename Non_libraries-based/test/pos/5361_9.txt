i saw it at a german press screening  without giving too much away  most critics really seemed to like it very much  there was even applause afterwards  which is quite unusual for that species  from my point of view and until now  it was the funniest movie of the year  it keeps the charm and wit of the three w g shorts and it is enlarged with many references to these and other movies  of course  there are obvious allusions to monster  and werewolf movies  especially to  an american werewolf in london   jaws   king kong  and even to peter jackson s  braindead dead alive  but also to other genres   characterization was better done in  chicken run  but that movie had a complete new  cast  where introduction was necessary  here  you are already able to know the two main characters  so  the new  wallace and gromit movie is enjoyed best if you watched  and liked  the shorts already  yet it also works on its own   chicken run  had the more convenient  but also more  storytelling  plot  instead  this new aardman masterpiece keeps that crazier and somehow more  isolated  feeling of the w g shorts  children should also enjoy it very much  especially because of the sweet rabbits  if you love cute bunnies  this is a must see for you  and because gromit has a lot do to and really steals the show  children also love dogs      but many jokes are thought for a more adult audience  there are even soft sexual allusions in it  the movie manages  like  shrek   and  the incredibles  to fulfil high level entertainment for the whole family  with adding a british and at least a little bit darker edge to the humour of american animated movies   the animation is   as expected   superb  and they kept true to the aardman style because they didn t put in too many digital effects   i realized just a few when it came to wallace s inventions   finally  the score works fine in the movie  although one of the main themes definitely is  borrowed  by randy edelman s  dragonheart  score   the bad thing is  it will probably take another six years from now until we can see a new animated gem from nick park   co
