i think that farscape is the best scifi since babylon   and is one of the best sci fi television series of all time  ranking up there with dr  who  blake s   red dwarf  mst k and the aforementioned b  i find the characters and races of farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical  humans with birthmarks  that are found in many series  the effects are quite good and the stories engaging  despite missing the bulk of season   and some of season   i find the character development very well done
