i really refused to see this movie  i refused to go with the school and i refused to go with my parents  just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid  to me anyway  one of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me   choices   the dukes of hazzard  or  wallace and gromit  the curse of the were rabbit  it took me   minutes to decide  time was running out  i had to choose  it came up on the screen  few  as in a few tickets left  by the time we had to line up and get our ticket  only one of us could go in  i desperately wanted nicholas to go in to see it  but he forced me  i crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that i was going in to see this childishness  i walked in  sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie  must say i was very surprised that i sat through that masterpiece  it was amazing  i don t know what i was complaining about  the clay animation was by far the most best i ve ever seen in my life  the story was brilliant  about a rabbit disrupting and crashing a carnival that had been planned for over   years  basically anti pest control are protecting the people who are competing in the vegetable competition  anti pesto known as wallace and gromit  who are in charge of this business  try to keep all the rabbits away from the vegetable carnival  i wont say anymore  it s just too good to tell  i ll admit that the whole idea of a were rabbit is ab it unbelievable and ab it childish  but nick park adds substance to it which what makes everyone love it  i mean  there wont be a   foot rabbit on the loose and there definitely wont be   foot werewolves as said in   dog soldiers  then again  were rabbits and werewolves aren t actual creatures  but either way  it worked out very well    the jokes also were more grown up  the kids wont get some of the jokes  it goes way above their heads  it had a lot of british jokes in there  if you love british humor  this is the movie for you   i also loved the cast and the voices  everything about the movie is so incredibly well done  the direction and pacing was absolutely fantastic  i recommend this to fans of the old wallace and gromit shorts  and no  i haven t seen them yet  and i recommend it to fans who liked  shrek  and  shrek   and most importantly  i recommend it to the people who love clay animation  cracking good movie
