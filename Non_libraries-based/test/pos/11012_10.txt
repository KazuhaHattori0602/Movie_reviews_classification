when i saw this film the first time i was very impressed concerning the kind of atmosphere the director creates  it is also very interesting to see how they imagine the near future in the year   if you see the film you will see a lot of sets and customs which are called freaky and modern again today   the topic of the film deals with the old question  what is real and what is illusion  if you see  the matrix  you will find a lot of similarities  but the two films are not comparable at all because  welt am draht  is art and  the matrix  is entertainment  if prefer the first one   unfortunately i lost my video copy of it
