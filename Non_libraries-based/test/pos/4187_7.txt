sadly  this movie is relegated to  curio  status it seems  many people that i ve asked  did you know the monkees made a movie  usually answer  no  that being said  if you are one of that large number  i recommend you see it  but with the following caveat s  if you expect monkey style humor  it is in there  it s just not all over the place like the tv shows   yes  they are trying to break their tv mold a bit by poking fun at it like a bunch of no longer teenagers who have been on the short end of a lot of sticks   no  you don t have to be inebriated to enjoy it   no  you don t have to be inebriated to understand it   if you like classics  you ll love the interspersed clips throughout   if you like the psychedelic era  you ll love some of the cameos   if you are a monkees fan  you might recognize some of the jabs they are taking at the heavy commercializing of the band   in the nigh immortal words of one of my best friends after seeing   minutes of it   this is a weird movie  man  in fact it might be better if you don t try to understand it  just sit back and react to it  it s weird  it s funny  it s a bit surreal  it s experimental  still it is many things  overall  it is an experience
