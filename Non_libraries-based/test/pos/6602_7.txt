i hate films about sports  i guess the pre fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year  what i am trying to say is that there isn t much creativity in this genre  use exhibit  a     the game plan  as evidence of this if you want  so  needless to say  i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element  but at the same time i couldn t wait because i love surfing documentaries like  step into liquid  and  billabong odyssey  i took a step  i plunged into the unknown  and to be honest  at first i wasn t happy  i didn t like the direction  the people  or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs  with my first viewing  i thought that history couldn t be fully recorded  so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux actors acting like they were from the late  s  the music was intense  it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment  but the visuals were anything but stimulating  the elongated scenes  while using amazing music to support  just seemed flushed and too long for my attention  i wanted to get to know the pioneers  not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool  i wanted a combination of who these kids were  where they went during their rise of fame  and where they are now  it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day  i wanted to know the men behind the myths   then  with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt  i watched the film again with peralta s audio commentary  his passion  his voice  his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished  wow ed  me  this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see  peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today  what they are still doing  and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera  he hadn t seen many of them in   years  so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface  he was sincere  he was sympathetic  yet he showed so much dedication to this project  while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do  i e  the sean penn mess up is not punk rock  he revitalized this film for me  it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought   jay adams  tony alva  jeff ho  peggy oki  wentzle ruml  these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned  and continually praised  if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees  while tony hawk s name sells products  it is these guys  these mild mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport  sure  others were probably doing it in the stone ages  but these guys did it with style  grace  and moved it to the next level  this was a hobby for them  but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for   dogtown and z boys  is the story of evolution  being in the right place at the right time  living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted  and about friendship  we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity  and this is definitely a story that should be added to that  i cannot say that i loved this film  nor will i  but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend  it was sad  it was emotional  and these guys aren t multi millionaires over again   they are people with a passion  and very rarely do you see that in documentaries   overall  i cannot watch this film again  but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time  i think the downfall for this film  to me  was the filming   the attempts to be avant garde with the style  which ultimately drew away from the characters and events  as mentioned before  there were some elements that dragged on too much  which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now  peralta obviously had a passion for this sport  for the people  but he seemed out of focus at times  the music was intense  and worked perfectly with the film  sean penn  while he was decent with his voice over  wasn t needed at all  they could have spent the money elsewhere  on the positive  the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing  peralta s voice  instead of penn s  brings a stronger human element to the scene  while he tells us better stories of the people  places  and events  watch this film  but don t expect to be blown away  listen to the audio commentary  i think you will be impressed   grade      out of
