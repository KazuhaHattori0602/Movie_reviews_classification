i can t stand people who comment on this program or other hbo programs as  too graphic  or  unnecessarily graphic  or that they contain  gratuitous nudity violence sodomy etc   guess what  prison life isn t pg  the  gratuitous  graphic content is true to life of this situation  prison contains inmate rape killings drug deals and showers  if you don t like it  then don t watch the program  i m certainly no fan of prison rape  but if it was left out of the show i d be surprised and lend the show less credibility  if the prisoners didn t curse  it would just be silly  sure it s gratuitous language  but that is realistic   the show is good  some of the viewers not so much  i guess
