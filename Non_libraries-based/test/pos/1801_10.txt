this is a romantic  albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites  it is one of the many classics of the  s genre like  pretty in pink  or  some kind of wonderful   nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley  preppy girl julie  it is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end   true  most of the acting sucks but    i have been in love with nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he s been in since  he s really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a lot of potential   if you love  s movies  you will love this classic   go rent it
