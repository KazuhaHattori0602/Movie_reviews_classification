just saw  the league of gentlemen  apocalypse  at a special screening in manchester  with mark gatiss and reece shearsmith of the league in attendance   at the back was peter kay  who has a brief cameo in the film  affectionately heckling at the back during the q   a session after the film   the film was complicated  in a good way  and very very funny  it follows geoff tipps  hilary briss and herr lipp as they try and save fictional rosyton vasey from the disinterest of their creators   the league play a wide range of their characters and themselves  or character based on themselves  and are ably supported by the cream of british character and comedy actors such as bernard hill  victoria wood and david warner   warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in  time bandits   the film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen s of rosyton vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick   steve pemberton s herr lipp has a great bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters   this echoes something mark and reece said in the q   a afterwards  that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them   for a format that started as a radio character based sketch show  these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction   reality  comedy  tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their   odd existing creations   the fans of the show will love it  it pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades  the uninitiated may be a little lost  but the joy of the log was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage   there are homages a plenty in this one including  the shining  and  la belle et la bete  to name but two i spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in  s england that makes perfect sense when you re engaged with the movie   what can i say  i marvelled  boggled  emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at  a successful british tv comedy to cinema translation   if you ve watched and enjoyed  the league of gentlemen  in the past  go see it  you will enjoy   if you haven t  rent buy a dvd and then go see it   well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous q   a
