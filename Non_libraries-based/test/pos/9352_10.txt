what a fine film  unfortunately  being   the movie script couldn t have followed the book from which it was adapted  but the murder of a homosexual would have been too hot to handle in that era   i thought all of the performances were outstanding  as well as the script  direction  brilliant black and white cinematography  music and film noir atmosphere   i do understand that in   the film couldn t portray racism against blacks or prejudice against homosexuals   robert young s account of prejudice against his grandfather who was irish and who endured this racism   years ago was pretty lame  but the times dictated that the film avoid a further examination of racism    i do have one observation and one question to ask the viewer    did you notice that robert young didn t aim his gun when he shot and killed robert ryan who was running fast in the dark and young shot from an upper story window into the dark without aiming    if robert young s grandfather was killed   years ago in    the film was made in   and young was   years old  the time line would not be logical  if the grandfather had been killed   years ago then the time frame would be realistic
