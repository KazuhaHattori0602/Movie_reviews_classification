i m not american  but meatballs still really hits me  maybe because it s a sweet  sweet movie  watching it again today made me sentimental for a time i can t really put my finger on and a place i can t quite remember   meatballs is just a great movie  it reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible   if you re reading this you probably know what i mean   all i can say on top of what i ve already said is that meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you re american   i guess you know what i mean by that too
