tony hawk s pro skater  x  isn t much different at all from the previous games  excluding tony hawk   the only thing new that is featured in tony hawk s pro skater  x  is the new selection of levels  and tweaked out graphics  tony hawk s pro skater  x offers a new career mode  and that is the  x career  the  x career is basically tony hawk   career  because there is only about five challenges per level  if you missed tony hawk   and   i suggest that you buy tony hawk s pro skater  x  but if you have played the first two games  you should still try this one  overall  there really isn t anything new  but it is still very fun to go through the game  hopefully this review benefits your needs   graphics    out of   overall  the clean visuals isn t really one of tony hawk s pro skater  x s main characteristics  the atmosphere has been changed around a lot from tony hawk   and   and the character models look a little bit improved  when you look back to tony hawk s pro skater   and   on the old ps  the thought that those old graphics are ugly run through your head  in tony hawk s pro skater  x  the graphics are rendered a lot better  the character models are no longer filled with jaggys  the textures are more smooth  but not to the farthest extent  tony hawk s pro skater  x s visuals do not compare to tony hawk  s graphics  but activision probably didn t want to make tony hawk s pro skater  x have extraordinary graphics  overall  the graphics deserve an average score of   because they did not put the full power of the xbox to use in here  graphics are nice  and clean  that s all i have to say   sound    out of   the sound effects don t deliver much to the imagination  but the skateboards popping off of the ground sound great  the main reason why i gave the sound factor a rating  was because you are not obligated to listen to the below average tony hawk soundtrack  because there is a custom soundtrack feature  the sound effects sound a lot better than the sounds in tony hawk   and   mainly because it is more clearer  and just the fact that everything sounds great  one of the main reasons why i bought this game  is because of the custom soundtrack  the grind sound effects still sound the same as the first two games did  just a little tweaked out  one of the major problems of the sound factor  is the fact that if the song is over  it will not proceed to the next track  the song that you have just listened to will just play over again  i don t like the in game soundtrack  but like i said  you are not obligated to listen to it   controls    out of   the controls are the best part of tony hawk s pro skater  x  the control set up is marvelously comfortable  and easy to get used to  back in the playstation days  people thought that the controls were the best ever  but it looks like  x has done a better job with the xbox control  surprisingly  it is very easy to use the control stick to execute tricks  activision has done great work with tony hawk s pro skater  x s controls  they have made the xbox controller the best for tony hawk games  you will not be disappointed with the control style  and that is a guarantee   game play    out of   excluding the fact that tony hawk s pro skater  x is basically tony hawk   and   put together  the game play is still unbelievably fun  the game play factor has been changed around a bit  this time  you get a lot more air than in the first two games  and it is a lot easier to perform tricks  in tony hawk s pro skater  x  each character has three career modes  consisting of tony hawk   career  tony hawk   career  and the  x career  tony hawk   career is rather easy because in the first game  you get nothing for air  the tony hawk   career delivers the same amount of difficulty as the playstation version did  the only amount of difficulty that applies to the  x career  is finding out where all items are  but after you ve done that   x career is no hard at all  in the  x career  there is a total of   levels  and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes  collecting s k a t e  and doing whatever else is required for that particular level  the third level out of the three  is the competition level  where you have to get a certain amount of points to get the gold  in the first two levels  the secret tapes  and collecting the letters s k a t e  are featured in both of them  overall  tony hawk s pro skater  x still maintains the old tony hawk s pro skater vibe   story     fun factor    out of   tony hawk s pro skater  x is by far  the most funnest game on xbox today  i have played tony hawk s pro skater   and   and back then  i didn t like them  but for some reason  tony hawk s pro skater  x is really fun  there really isn t much to say  except that tony hawk s pro skater  x is by far  the best game on xbox today  one problem  is that if you ve already gone through the game once  you will play it a couple more times  but it will be repetitive   replay value    out of   tony hawk s pro skater  x delivers a high amount of replay value  there is a lot of cheats to unlock  and a lot of character videos  overall  tony hawk s pro skater  x has lots of replay value  mainly because it is so fun   best feature  you are not obligated to listen to the crappy in game soundtrack  worst feature  the custom soundtrack is a bit messed up   final statement  lots of people have complained in the past that they didn t like tony hawk s pro skater  x because there is nothing new  but they should stop complaining because your getting a lot of game for    graphics    out of   sound    out of   control    out of   game play    out of   story  n a fun factor    out of    overall score    out of
