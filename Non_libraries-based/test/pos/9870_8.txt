 dislike this movie and everyone would understand why  the plot is poor  so is the acting  but in my opinion it is better than halloween   although even this does not give many surprising moments  a few scenes are really well directed  but these few moments do not deliver the reason to rent it  i do not despise violence in movies  but h  features extraordinary strong and bloody scenes which do not fit to the tradition of the halloween movies  the most sucking aspect about h  is the lack of tension  no comparison to the first masterpiece   halloween   only gets   out of   stars from me  if you want  rent it  but don t expect a great horror experience
