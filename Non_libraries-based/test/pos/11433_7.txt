 the missing star  who competed for the golden lion at   venice film festival  is a film that  when you think about  the first adjective that comes to your mind is  intense  intense looks  intense sequences  this movie s intensity captures the viewer since the very first scenes at the steelworks  in italy  i couldn t recognize the city  maybe genoa or even naples  although the pace is quite slow   vincenzo buonavolont  the male lead  and with him  all the audience  sees a completely different china than a normal westerner imagines  horrible high rise building with about   hundred flat owners inside  skyscrapers  desolation  fog  scrapers and cranes everywhere  but also the beauty of the yangtze kiang river  that will soon become a big lake because of the controversial dike that will wipe a lot of towns out  china is a country under construction  but  under all these colossal public works  there are still poverty  backwardness and unfair laws   we can relate more easily to this story because gianni amelio  the expert director  chose two phenomenal leads  sergio castellitto  a well known actor in italy  and the chinese surprise tai ling  a total unknown girl that gives an as intense interpretation as castellitto s   the film is not perfect  there are some flaws here and there  but that doesn t mean it s a mediocre film  try to see it
