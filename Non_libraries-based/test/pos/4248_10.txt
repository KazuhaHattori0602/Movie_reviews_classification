i have to admit i had never heard of this movie  i caught it last night on tmc  i thought it was hysterical  i laughed so hard and loved the ending  image what a marx brothers movie would like if they collaborated with salvadore dali and malcolmn x and then all dropped lsd   funny and edgy are two overused words these days  this movie sure has that plus about   iq points of most comedies today and surrealistic to boot  i had to be up at   am and watched it until   i over slept and missed my obligations  still worth it  i would not recommend renting it  i would recommend owning it  it was that good   the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people  bare with it and use your head   i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time
