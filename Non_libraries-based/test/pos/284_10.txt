with the obvious exception of fools   horses  this was in my opinion david jason s finest series   coming straight after his tv debut on  do not adjust your set  these   episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days  by comparison  porridge  open all hours and that awful series  lucky man  did not come close   i believe jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest  shame on him  a new generation deserves to enjoy this  the series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against  the brothers  which aired on bbc at the same time  before vcrs were commonplace   btw  i have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant  spencer  was played by mark eden   alan bradley off coronation street  i am amazed he didn t try to murder edgar briggs
