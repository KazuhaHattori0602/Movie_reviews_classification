this is an exceptional picture with so much to recommend it  the acting and writing are terrific and there are lots of great twists and turns in the plot  as a french  noir  film  its language is certainly a lot earthier than its american counterparts  but to me this just added to the realism  additionally  i liked how non glamorous everyone was particularly the husband and the lieutenant  about the only negative  and the reason the film gets a   and not a   is because there was a glaring plot hole  like another famous french film  dr le de drame  the confusion between the cops and the accused could easily have been settled in the beginning  but the characters made rather stupid decisions  for this  you just need to suspend disbelief and keep watching the payoff is well worth the wait   this is simply one of the finest french films i have seen  period
