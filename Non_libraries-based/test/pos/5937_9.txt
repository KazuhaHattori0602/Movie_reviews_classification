i have enjoyed both of the van dykes over the years and was glad to watch them again   just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoy   dick was good when he was younger but i enjoyed him more as he got older   son berry has been a great one to follow in his fathers footsteps   together they make a great team and work well together   i am disappointed that i have not found another murder   listed anywhere   i have seen both of the ones that have been shown  i am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watch   you can sure tell berry follows in his dad footsteps  they talk alike and have the same mannerisms   would enjoy anything they do separately   will be sure to watch anything they do alone and together
