definitely a movie for people who ask only to be entertained and who do not over think their movies    lots of action  lots of great dialogue  e g  fun to quote  a little intrigue  and stuff blowing up all over the place  samuel l jackson and geena davis had great chemistry  violent  but not gory  the fact that the female part was the competent action lead is a pleasant turn about   have seen the movie more than a dozen times and still enjoy it enough to put it back in my favorite films rotation every   or   months  i initially rented the movie because samuel l jackson was in the film  but was caught up in the events surrounding samantha s quest to regain her memory and have never looked back   all you cerebral folks out there   suspend disbelief for once  take yourself a little less seriously   you might actually enjoy yourselves
