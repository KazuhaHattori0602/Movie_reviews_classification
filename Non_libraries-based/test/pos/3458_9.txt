a stunning film which brought into the open so much about disability that generally makes people afraid  it showed how minds can be captured by less than willing bodies and how difficult it must be to witness things happening to others that are wanted for the disabled individual   love  friendship  fear  frustration  joy  humour and so many others things were so well captured  the   lead characters were very well played by the   able bodied actors and invited your laughter  tears  concern  joy and dismay   i approached this film with a mixture of interest and trepidation worrying that it might be too much a play for sympathy or dwell only on negatives  it was however a beautifully crafted story of   friends   i loved it
