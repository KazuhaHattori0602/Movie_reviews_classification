i recently saw this at the   palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites  this is a spoof on the french cottage industry of oss   films of the  s and  s  the first oss   film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in   long before the first james bond film  staring ivan desny as hubert bonisseur de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to   with luc merenda  frederick stafford  kerwin matthews and john gaven all taking turns as oss   jean dujardin is in the title role in this comedic take on the series  as the film begins set in   he has a french mustache and resembles desny but as the film begins it s setting of   he really looks like sean connery  jean fran ois halim wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend  it borrows on the silliness of naked gun  get smart and the pink panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a revived oss   reworked to comedy adventures  michel hazanavicius directs  i would give this a   and recommend it
