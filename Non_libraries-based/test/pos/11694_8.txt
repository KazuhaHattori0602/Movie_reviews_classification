i recently saw this at the   palm springs international film festival  the film s title and in fact much of the outline of the film is from the robert graves poem beauty in trouble  jan hrebejk directs a screenplay by petr jrchovsk  from a story by hrebejk and jrchovsk  the story begins in   when prague is hit by one of those devastating   year floods that destroys the household of marcela  ana ceislerov  and jarda  roman lukn r  and their two children kuba  adam misik  and lucina  michaela mrvikova  because of the moldy conditions where they now live kuba s asthma is life threatening  marcela works and jarda runs a chop shop out of the garage they live next to  jarda s shady occupation runs him afoul of the law and one of his theft victims becomes infatuated with marcela  evzen benes  josef abrh m  is a wealthy businessman who divides his time between italy and the czech republic and offers to care marcela and her two kids  jana brejchov  is marcella s mother who lives with her common law husband called uncle richie played by jir  schmitzer in probably the film s best role  rounding out this excellent cast is em lia vasaryova as jarda s mentally fragile mother who gives any money she gets to the local religious charlatan  there is a lot going on here for a small film and it s good story with a great script and a lot of comic relief  ales brezina provides the music score with additional music from czech singer raduza and irish singer glen hansard  there is a lot to like about this film and i would give it an   out of   and recommend it
