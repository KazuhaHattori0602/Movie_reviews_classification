this film makes several nods to various science fiction films  the prologue reminds me of the one for the original theatrical version of thx   the trailer for buck rogers  here it was clips from some early japanese sf tv show  then the opening shot of the city in   has the dragon blip flying overhead with a billboard  reminding one immediately of bladerunner  the bladerunner aspect comes even  more pronounced when we meet the hero  who is called a replicant  he is blond haired and is called ryo  a homage to roy batty  rutger hauer s character in bladerunner  a battle scene soon ensues which reminds one immediately of the matrix  the government forcing the population to take drugs is like thx  and the chief enforcer  while looks like a cross between elvis and dan ackroyd  turns out to be a robot  very much like the terminator  the end battle reminds one of terminator   and the end result is hilarious  probably not one of the best sf films out there  but is enjoyable  certainly a lot more enjoyable than tripe like battlefield earth
