the phenomenon helge schneider defies easy description or quick categorization  yet  for the international audience not acquainted to him  one could say he s something like a crude mix of weird al yankovich and andy kaufman  adding a foible for jazz music and  s outfits  while his stage performances already are eccentric  his movie works are simply hilariously outrageous     schneider  is  in my opinion  helge s best movie  he stars in the two leading roles   police detective  kommissar   schneider  and murderer villain  nihil baxter  and also in a precious smaller role as physician  dr  hasenbein   in the opening scene  we see how modern art loving baxter accidentally kills the circus clown bratislav metulskie  from whom he has bought a malfunctioning used jaguar  when a beloved sculpture slips out of baxter s hands  fatally hitting metulskie  upon reading about the incident in the newspaper    comes back from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick  lt  koerschgen  who is played by an elderly actor bearing the same name  they pick up baxter s track quickly  and interrogate him at his weirdly decorated mansion  one of the movie s best scenes  but initially fail to gather any proof  the story winds through many turns  with several scenes that don t always really contribute to the progress of the plot but are hilariously funny  such as a daydream by    including the most unusual view on a running man s brief clad crotch in movie history  a police department party during which koerschgen gets into a row with the chief and has to be hospitalized  and a visit at the already mentioned dr  hasenbein s  baxter  then  is finally caught attempting to escape to rio de janeiro on a plane   always worth special mention is andreas kunze who in this case plays  s wife  as he s usually appearing in drag performing women s roles in helge s movies   so all you folks out there looking for new laughs  i strongly recommend this movie  the catch  you have to understand german  as i doubt there s an english version around
