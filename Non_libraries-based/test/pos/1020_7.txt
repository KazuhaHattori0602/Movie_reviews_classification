doe eyed high school student kathleen beller is found beaten and  raped in the opening scenes of this made for tv movie  the film  then flashbacks to the few days before the rape  as beller is  harassed by a stranger   beller and scott colomby and her best friend robin mattson and  dennis quaid are double dating early on  beller s anxious parents   laid back tony bill and shrill blythe danner  wait at home wringing  hands and so on  right away  the  s makes its dated  entrance  as the young couples discuss the romance and love in   three days of the condor   beller  an amateur photographer  begins getting threatening notes  stuffed in her locker at school  the film makers wisely give us a  whole slew of suspects  beller s new boyfriend  mattson s  boyfriend  beller s dad  beller s ex boyfriend  and what about that  overly friendly photography class teacher who wants beller to be a  little more sexy in her self portraits  i knew who the rapist was  because the worldvision video company video box has a picture of  the attack on the back cover  destroying any suspense in that  regard   without giving away who the attacker is  beller begins getting  harassing phone calls  and is eventually raped  the movie then  heads south as she makes like nancy drew and secretly sets up  a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student   finally  the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from  beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that  day and age   the suspense here is very real  without going over the top into  scary movie stuff  beller is very good  and watch for her and  mattson s scene in an abandoned theater  both do great jobs  the  film is full of familiar faces  including ellen travolta in a small role   and everyone is professional   this was made in   and it shows  i am sure no one had any  idea that this would be reviewed in   by an overcritical horror  movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the  morning  but some of the attitudes here are embarassing  the  teacher who tells beller to be sexy is never made to explain what  exactly he had in mind  nowadays  if any high school teacher said  that  then that would have been a made for tv movie on its own   after beller is raped  the rapist is still a part of her life  as warrants  are issued  blah  blah  blah  there may not be a case because  beller is not a virgin  and cannot prove she was raped by whom  she said  many of these problems have been addressed with  modern technology and policing efforts  but this film obviously  knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate  rape is  an act of violence that has not gone away  but efforts today to catch  the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago  the  problem is the anti rape angle feels tacked on  like an  afterthought  before that  we have a tight little suspenser that has  real honest to god characterization  after the rape  everything  changes  filmwise  and not for the better   i remember beller from the  s and  s  and who could forget  her revealing role in  the betsy  but she has not done anything in  almost ten years  this is a shame  since she was very good way  back then   i will recommend  are you in the house alone  based on the  acting alone  with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of  the film  if you want to relive  s made for tv high school life   this is your cup of tab   this is unrated but contains physical violence  some sexual  violence  and some adult situations
