a fun romp a lot of good twists and turns   and we were not even baked   didn t know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a monty python dvd oddly it was there along with the city of lost children  and the adventures of baron munchauhsen   the plot keeps you wondering throughout   the acting was awesome hank azaria shows his talent again  bill bob is billy bob wecis   definitely worth watching
