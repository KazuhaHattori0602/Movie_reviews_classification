by now  the game s stale  right   the jokes have been done  its all over  the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone  after all   wrong   the game is still intact  the jokes are here  folks  sure  they re all rehash  but so was monkey island   and   for that matter   the difficulty is well placed  somewhere between the slightly easy   and the ridiculously hard   the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate  in the tradition of sub games  and this game has the best joke of the whole series  when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach  always select  you don t need to see my identification  its worth the price of the game by itself
