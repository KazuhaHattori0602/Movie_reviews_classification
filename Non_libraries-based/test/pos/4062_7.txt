as many of today s movies are guilty of  the plot isn t exactly stellar  the movie doesn t move anyone  and certainly this won t warrant any award  outside of blockbusters  perhaps but then again  who really cares   eddie murphy and robert de niro team up to produce a very funny  at times hilarious  movie that i really enjoyed  russo and shatner played their small parts well as well  man  i hope in the future my wife ages as well as miss renee has   moving along  this  buddy  cop flick produces high laughs in a reasonable amount of time  the movie is enjoyable enough to avoid the wait for video dvd release and instead to go ahead and check it out   eddie murphy is at his usual top form and is downright enjoyable to watch  de niro has molded into this type of role perfectly   i really enjoyed this movie and think that any true movie fan in need for a good movie or just a good laugh will really enjoy showtime   top performance  murphy  hilarious  enough said  directing job  nice  nice action scenes  used murphy and de niro together like a charm  russo fed off in a nice supporting job   my rating    out   it s not going to move you or anything but it s an extremely enjoyable movie   it s showtime was a great success
