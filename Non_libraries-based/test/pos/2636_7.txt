at the time of this writing  january     i am saddened to hear of the passing within the past few hours of chris penn  other than footloose  the wild life is the film that i remember chris most from   i still remember in the film  with slight fondness  of chris  wrestling character and teammates sitting in their favourite restaurant with a huge plate of french fries in front of them  drowned in an entire bottle of ketchup   anyhow  my comment is in regards to the title track sung by bananarama  after these many years  i still remember the rumour  canadian spelling   lol  that bananarama was called in at the very very last moment to compose the track for the film and that they wrote the song on the plane bound to the recording studio to record the song and just after they recorded the song they went to shoot the low cost video for their title track  i heard that this entire process  from start to finish  took   hours to do  if this is true  then they truly are worthy of being the most successful female band of all time   anyhow this is just a rumour i had heard back in the day and still remember a generation later  perhaps anyone who reads this can comment and clarify  thanks
