this is a great movie  all   were  the last one was not as good as the first   but it was made along time after and it was pulling at straws  but you want to watch it cause it tells the end of the story  just not how we might think it should end   these movies made me want to be there to be in all the hardship  love  tears  and laughter that the people in this movie go threw  it is one of the few movies that is good every time you see it no matter how many times that is   there are some parts in the movie that the little kids wont understand and the older ones maynot be old enough to watch  but it is a great movie  spanning over   years
