operation scorpio  akathe scorpion king  doesn t slip into top gear until the last   minutes or so  but when the action does hit top speed  it delivers some truly amazing martial arts scenes that demand the viewer s attention  that is not to say that the first hour is worthless  just that compared to the final fight fest  it seems a bit underwhelming   the plot revolves around yuk su  a talented comic artist who dreams of being a hero just like those he depicts in his drawings  when yuk su rescues a young maid  siu yu  who is being sold into prostitution  he incurs the wrath of her evil boss  wa  led by sonny  master of scorpion style kung fu  wa s henchmen give chase to yuk su and the maid  yuk su s father intervenes but he is injured  after being rescued by some friendly bodybuilders  the three eventually hide out at a noodle restaurant  owned by their friend  master yat   yuk su learns to cooks noodles  but also regularly sneaks out in order to secretly build his strength and learn kung fu under the tutelage of jean  the teacher of the musclebound hulks who rescued them  when master yat must leave on business  yuk su is left in charge of the kitchen  however  he pops out to practise his skills with jean  leaving siu yu to serve the customers  sonny and his men visit the restaurant and  disgusted by the noodles they are served  trash the restaurant   when master yat learns that yuk su has been sneaking out  he tells him that he should have learnt kung fu from him  it transpires that master yat used to be a top triad assassin  until he decided to try and change his ways  under the guidance of master yat  yuk su improves his skills  even learning the art of the shadowless kick  yuk su eventually gets a chance to try and become a real hero when his friend  fatty  announces that his maid has also been sold into prostitution  with jean  they visit wa posing as french brothel keepers looking for new women  when fatty s maid is presented to them  she accidentally blows their ruse and at last the action kicks off big style  despite his best efforts  jean is badly beaten by sonny and he and yuk su are forced to flee  on returning to the restaurant  yuk su finds it ablaze  and worst of all  the bad guys have found siu yu  yuk su  accompanied by master yat  returns to wa s place to try and rescue siu yu   despite some fairly entertaining training scenes  the slow build up to the final action at wa s house is rather too drawn out and devoid of any serious fight scenes  it is a shame that the tedium wasn t broken up by a decent scrap midway  rather than saving all of the juicy stuff until the end   the last fight  however  is worth the wait in the end  won jin gives a jaw dropping performance as the high kicking sonny who scuttles  flips and spins with amazing skill and dexterity  and chin kar lok gives a solid performance as yuk su  the artist turned fighter  also particularly good is old school kung fu star lau kar leung  aka liu chia liang  as master yat  proving that this old timer has still got what it takes to kick ass  although not a perfect film  operation scorpio has enough standout action in its finale to definitely warrant a viewing   nb  i may have got some of the names wrong  my dvd calls characters by different names than those listed on imdb
