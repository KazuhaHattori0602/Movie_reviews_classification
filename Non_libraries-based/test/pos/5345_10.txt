who can ask for more  taking my   and   year old children was a risk  i admit  but well worth it  they were enthralled from credit to credit  with their parents beside them   i have taken the kids to films before with mixed results  too scary  too boring  too sophisticated  whatever  with this film  however  i was glad to see a smart film with wit  style and a sense of passion emanating from the screen  any film that takes   years of production to make  good or bad  deserves some respect for the bravery and the patience it takes to film a film like this   o k  i m gushing a little  then again  why wouldn t i get excited  looking through the movie listing today only reminded me of the poor quality of films that are distributed  at least for the moment regardless  w   g is a film well made  perhaps the originality wasn t the most inspired  nevertheless  well told and well paced   too much adult humour  too many sex references  maybe  though my kids didn t quite catch them  too young  so  in my case  i didn t really notice   well  needless to say  i liked it
