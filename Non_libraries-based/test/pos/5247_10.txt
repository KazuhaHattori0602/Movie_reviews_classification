contrary to the comment posted directly below  the big trail   was not filmed in a three camera process  much like the later cinerama  that was the finale to napoleon   a different film entirely  the big trail was simultaneously shot in both  mm and  mm  grandeur  versions  and both versions are shown on fox movie channel from time to time  so it s easy to compare one with the other  the grandeur version  broadcast in letterbox   approximately its original   ratio  is more impressive cinematically with its wide angle panoramas  but suffers from the same problem that beset early cinemascopes  a lack of close ups forced upon director raoul walsh because of focus problems  scenes involving individuals rather than crowds or long shots are much more effective in the standard version because the camera can move closer to the players thereby achieving a greater sense of involvement for the viewer  watching the two versions simultaneously  one gets an accurate idea of which shots walsh chose to shoot close up  in the standard version  but could not  in the grandeur version  there are also a couple sequences involving el brendel  a shell game with ian keith  and some business with his wife   a jackass  which are in the grandeur version  but missing from the standard version   for the record  the big trail is the only one of three fox grandeur films which has survived in its original wide screen format   the other two are fox movietone follies of   completely lost  and happy days  which survives only in standard format  other studios also experimented with wide film at this time  but the only other one still known to exist in both formats is the bat whispers  filmed in both  mm and  mm  and released by united artists  other wide films were mgm s billy the kid   and the great meadow   rko s danger lights   and wb s the lash   all of which can be seen in their standard format versions on turner classic movies  wb s kismet   was also filmed both wide and standard  but seems to have completely disappeared  it is rumored to be lost   why did wide film fail in   theaters were reeling  pun intended  under the impact of the stock market crash of october   and the spiraling costs of installing sound equipment  and so were adverse to taking on the added expense of installing additional new projection equipment and new wider screens to accommodate just a handful of films  photographed in a variety of different systems that were not even always compatible with each other  it would not be until   when fox  now twentieth century fox  would try again  and this time succeed  with the introduction of wide screen cinemascope
