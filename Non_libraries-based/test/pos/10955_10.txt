improvisation was used to a groundbreaking degree in this film  but it only functions as a novelty  no greater truth about the situation is got by asking the actors to improvise  the performances are not improved by improvisation  because the actors now have twice as much to worry about  not only whether they re delivering the line well  but whether the line itself is any good  so that s why the performances in many robert altman films are often really hestitant   because the actors aren t really confident saying lines which they ve made up  and therefore aren t sure are any good   and  quite honestly  often its not very good  often the dialogue doesn t really follow from one line to another  or fit the surroundings   it crackles with an unpredictable  youthful energy   but honestly  i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly   nevertheless  a fascinating raw piece of film  and commendable   for taking the power over the green light into the street   there are some generally great things in it  this joke  for example   i m a dancer  what sort of a dancer  like a ballet dancer  oh no  exotic   and the whole party scene its in  the following trip to the park  and the scene where the boys go looking at statues     i wouldn t say they re worth   hours of your time  though
